[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the risk factor section of our most recently filed Form 10-K as supplemented by our 10-Q filed on November 4, 2020. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today\u2019s call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our fourth quarter and full-year results. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you all joining us today and I hope everybody is staying well. I want to start with something difficult. I want to start by extending my most heartfelt condolences to the Sorenson family and the thousands of Marriott associates around the world following the heartbreaking news of Arne\u2019s passing. To say I\u2019m deeply saddened by that loss. It would be an understatement. I as many of had the opportunity to work with Arne in a number of capacities throughout my career, including earlier on at host. I think it\u2019s very fair to say he was an exceptional leader, but also an incredible person and a great friend. Our industry is better, because of him and I am a better professional and a better person, because of him. On behalf of everyone at Hilton family and the entire Marriott family are in our thoughts. As we all know this past year has presented unique challenges, including a pandemic that devastated lives, communities and businesses across the world, widespread economic declines and acts of social injustice. Due to the extraordinary levels of disruption, our industry experience demand declines we\u2019ve never seen before in our 101-year history. Guided by our founding purpose to make the world a better place through the light and warmth of hospitality we acted quickly to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our people. We also took steps to protect our business by rightsizing our cost structure and enhancing our liquidity position while continuing to drive net unit growth and increase our network effect. As a result of these news, we expect to recover from the pandemic as a stronger higher margin business that is even better positioned to deliver performance for our owners and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. While it\u2019s certainly been a very difficult year, we\u2019re proud of everything we\u2019ve accomplished, but we certainly could not have done it without the support of all of our stakeholders. For that, I\u2019d like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of our loyal customers, our important owner partners, our communities who supported us and enabled us to support them, our team members who gave their hearts and souls to our business and our shareholders who stood by us. Because of our amazing people, we\u2019ve been able to lean on our award-winning culture, which earned the number one best place to work in the United States for the second consecutive year and the number three world\u2019s best workplace to help get us through these trying times. Turning to results for the full year system-wide RevPAR declined 57% with adjusted EBITDA down only modestly more illustrating the resiliency of our fee-based model. We also demonstrate the strength of our brands and power of our customer centric strategy by achieving market share gains across every region even in a distressed business environment. For the quarter system-wide RevPAR declined 59% relatively in line with our expectations. The positive momentum and demand that we saw through the summer and early fall was disrupted in November, December by rising COVID cases, tightening travel restrictions and further hotel suspensions, particularly in Europe. Similar to the third quarter drive to leisure travel drove an outsized portion of demand. Business transient and group trends showed modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter, but overall demand remained quite muted. As we look to the year ahead, we remain optimistic that accelerating vaccine distribution will lead to easing government restrictions and unlocked pent-up travel demand for the first quarter overall trends so far appear to be similar to the fourth quarter with modest increases in demand in the U.S. offsetting stalled recoveries in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We expect improving fundamentals heading into spring with essentially all system-wide rooms reopened by the end of the second quarter. We expect a more pronounced recovery in the back half of the year driven by increased leisure demand and meet meaningful rebounds, and corporate transient and group business. Over the last year, the personal savings rate in the United States has nearly doubled increasing by more than $1.6 trillion to $2.9 trillion with the potential to go even higher given additional stimulus. We expect this to drive greater leisure demand as travel restrictions ease and markets reopened a tourism. Additionally, conversations with our large corporate customers along with sequential upticks in business transient booking pace year-to-date indicate that there is pent-up demand for business travel that should drive a recovery in corporate transient trends as the year progress. On the group side, we saw meaningful step up in new group demand in January with our back half group position showing significant sequential improvement versus the first half of the year. With roughly 70% of bookings made within a week of travel, overall visibility remains limited. However, we continue to see signs of optimism. In fact, the vast majority of our large corporate accounts agreed to extend 2020 negotiated rates into this year. Despite the challenges in 2020, we up in more than 400 hotels, totaling nearly 56,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.1% slightly ahead of guidance. Fourth quarter openings were up nearly 30% year-over-year, largely driven by new development in China, where our focus service brands continue to command a disproportionate share of industry growth. We also celebrated our 1 million through milestone and the openings of our 300th hotel in China, our 600th DoubleTree hotel and our 900th Hilton Garden Inn. We ended up the year with 397,000 rooms in our development pipeline up 3% year-over-year. While our market disruption wait on new development signings, conversion signings increased more than 30% versus the prior year. As owners looked a benefit from the strength of our network, we anticipate continued positive momentum and conversion activity, particularly through DoubleTree and our Collection brands. During the quarter, we signed agreements to expand our Curio Collection in Mexico and bring our Tapestry Collection to Portugal. This marks one of several new Tapestry hotels scheduled to open across Europe this year. We also announced plans to debut LXR in the Seychelles with Mango House Seychelles, the property will deliver a truly unique hospitality experience with spacious guestrooms and suites and five world-class food and beverage venues. Schedule to open in the coming months, the hotel underscores our commitment to further expanding our resort portfolio. Building on that momentum, we kicked off 2021 with an agreement to bring LXR to Bali. Additionally, we celebrated the opening of Oceana Santa Monica, which marked LXR is U.S. debut as well as the Waldorf Astoria, Monarch Beach Resort and the Hilton Vancouver Downtown, which was converted from a competitor brand. With these notable openings and many exciting development opportunities in front of us, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering solid growth over the next several years. The pandemic rapidly change guest behaviors, priorities and concerns, we listened to our customers and move quickly to launch modifications to our Honors Loyalty Program, deliver industry leading standards of cleanliness and hygiene with Hilton CleanStay and provide flexible distraction-free environments for remote work with workspaces by Hilton. Additionally, with an even stronger focus on recovery last month, we implemented Hilton EventReady Hybrid Solutions and expanded set of resources to help event planners address the dramatic shift towards hybrid meetings as group business rebound. Our flexibility and innovation drove continued growth in our honors network, ending the year with more than 112 million members who accounted for approximately 60% of system-wide occupancy. Throughout 2020, we also remain focused on our corporate responsibility and our commitment to our ESG initiatives. We\u2019re proud to contribute to our communities and we\u2019re honored to be named the global industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. In a year marked by challenge and change, we effectively executed our crisis response strategy, carefully manage key stakeholder relationships and continue to press forward on strategic opportunities. I\u2019m confident that there are brighter days ahead and that we are in a stronger, more resilient and we are better positioned than ever before. With that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the fourth quarter and the full year.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I\u2019d like to echo Chris\u2019s sentiments about Arne, my thoughts are certainly with his family and with my many friends at Marriott, who I know are hurting this morning. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 59.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis as the pandemic continued to disrupt the demand environment. Relative to the third quarter, occupancy was modestly lower, partially due to seasonality and further tempered by rising COVID cases and associated travel restrictions. Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million in the fourth quarter, down 65% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management and franchise fees decreased 50% less than RevPAR decreased as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better than expected honors license fees and development fees. Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. For the full year, our corporate G&A expenses were down nearly 30% year-over-year at the high end of our expectations. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging demand environment, temporary closures in Europe and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our lease properties. Continued cost control measures coupled with one-time items, mitigated segment losses. For the quarter, diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.10. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to enhance our liquidity position and preserve our financial flexibility. Over the last few months, we opportunistically refinanced $3.4 billion of senior notes to extend our maturities at lower rates. In January, we also repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. On a pro forma basis, taking these transactions into effect as of year-end 2020, we\u2019ve lowered our weighted average cost of debt to 3.6% and extended our weighted average maturity to 7.2 years. We have no major debt maturities until 2024 and maintain a wealth staggered maturity later thereafter. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good morning guys.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Greff: Nice to hear your voices. Chris, I just want to start off with a big picture question, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a lot of questions about 2021 net rooms growth and how you\u2019re thinking about pipeline growth from here. But Chris, love to hear your thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about your business three years out post vaccine. What\u2019s different about your business in terms of individual business transient travel, group travel, leisure travel relative to pre-COVID? What\u2019s different do you think about full service and limited service development in the future relative to pre-COVID?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And so a lot to unpack there. But I think, Joe, when you go out and obviously you could debate this and I\u2019ve debated it ad nauseam with a lot of people. I think if you go out three years, whatever, three or four years, I think demand is going to look a lot like it did in 2017, 2018 and 2019. And meaning the makeup of the business as between business transient, leisure transient and group at that point in time, I think will look quite similar. Now, certain of the types of \u2013 if you get underneath the demand, particularly in business transient and the group side might be for different reasons, then I mean, there\u2019ll be a substitution effect clearly in certain types of travel being substituted with sort of the new \u2013 the Zoom calls and digital opportunities. But there\u2019ll be replaced with other forms of travel. We\u2019ve seen this throughout history, I mean, if you go back and it wasn\u2019t really around, but the telephone and the internet and telepresence and voicemail, there were always the arguments that this is going to truncate the need to travel and congregate. And the reality is what it typically does is it accelerates it, right. Because it just gives more efficiency. It speeds \u2013 it ultimately speeds things up. It ultimately continues to connect the world and speed up globalization. And as a result, people need to congregate, they need to travel, they need to build relationships, they need to build cultures, they need to innovate. And those things really cannot be done as well without face-to-face opportunities, both in a group setting, as well as individual business travel type needs. And so I \u2013 having done it longer than I\u2019d like to admit, 35, 40 years, we\u2019ve been debating this. I don\u2019t \u2013 again, I think there\u2019ll be some substitution effect, but I think it\u2019ll look a lot like it did. And then our business a couple of comments since you asked, our business is going to be a better business and a stronger business and a faster growing higher margin business. Why because, listen, throughout the next three years, we\u2019re going to continue to grow 4% to 5% unit growth. So we\u2019re going to be a bigger company. The units that we had pre COVID, if you believe what I believe, which is you\u2019ll have similar demand levels. We\u2019ll be producing, like they were. You\u2019ll have all these new units that are then going to also be producing and you have a lower cost structure. Because we\u2019ve taken a significant amount of cost out on a cash basis, sort of, if you look at on a run rate in this year sort of on a cash basis in the mid-teen, something like that, maybe a little bit better. And we\u2019re going to be incredibly disciplined as we always have been. I think we\u2019ve been on a G&A basis, at the low end of spending in the industry, but we got even better last year. And that\u2019s going to, when you put all the same flows of fees through the system with more units and a lower cost structure, it\u2019s simple math, it\u2019s a higher margin business. And so I know, it\u2019s sort of an odd time to be pounding the table with optimism. And so I probably shouldn\u2019t, but as we sit around this table, I\u2019m at our board table and we talk about it. It\u2019s been hard year, the hardest any of us have ever endured, but as a result of it, we put ourselves and about the best position we could have. And honestly, I think the business is going to be better for it. And I think it\u2019s going to produce higher margins and more free cash flow, which we\u2019re going to be \u2013 which is going to allow us to return even more capital than we were pre-COVID to our shareholders, which you think over the very long-term is going to drive incredible returns. The last point was on limited service, full service, and I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m covering a lot of territory, but you ask these things. And I think it\u2019s an important note, because it\u2019s something I talked a lot about pre-COVID that, frankly, I don\u2019t think got enough attention, which is the megatrend in our \u2013 in the industry, in every market in the world. There is not an exception is the mid-market, right. Why is that? Because, that\u2019s where the bulk of the population is, that\u2019s where the bulk of the population growth is, particularly in the emerging markets. And so what can those people afford mid-market brands? I would say, I know I\u2019m sort of patting us that. We have the best mid-market brands in the world. I mean, it\u2019s being proven out in the growth of those brands, both in the U.S. but outside the U.S., outstripping the competition in Europe, outstripping the competition in Asia Pacific, particularly China. And that\u2019s not by luck, we\u2019ve been very purposeful over the last 10 years and making sure that we take the best brands here, and we adapt those and refine those from a product and service point of view, we picked great development partners, like, we\u2019ve done in China to make sure that these are adapted to those environments, what the customers want, what the development community in those environments \u2013 in those regions want. That has allowed us to show really strong and growth and continue to. So the megatrend, which was before COVID, and I would say, as a result of the economic distress that this has caused only gets sort of accentuated in a post-COVID world is the mid-market. And I feel really, really good about the work that we\u2019ve done to put ourselves in a good position. And I think it\u2019s showing up in the numbers of our unit growth, right. Because the bulk of that unit, I mean, we have lots of great things going on in luxury, we\u2019re making tremendous progress there, lots of great things going on in the upper upscale and all that. But the bulk of \u2013 you see, particularly in this environment, the bulk of the growth all over the world is really coming in limited service. And I\u2019ve been saying it for years, if you wake up in 20 years and you look back and say, where was the bulk of the growth and demand. And thus the bulk of the growth in rooms, it\u2019s going to be in the mid-market. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been focused on everything, but so intensely focused in that, because in the end, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive a higher growth rate. That is what having the best brands in that space that we adapt to the local market conditions is what\u2019s going to deliver alpha for us, the real alpha over the next 10 or 20 years.\nJoe Greff: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate it, Chris. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey guys. Good morning. And thanks for taking the questions.\nChris Nassetta: Hey, Carlo.\nCarlo Santarelli: [Indiscernible]\nChris Nassetta: Carlo, we can\u2019t hear you very well. Could you speak up a little, sorry?\nCarlo Santarelli: I\u2019m sorry, guys. Do you hear me a little better?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, yes, yes. Sorry.\nCarlo Santarelli: So I appreciate you taking my question. You\u2019ve spent some time on talking about how you\u2019re thinking about pipeline and I guess kind the conversion look, maybe about 19% of [indiscernible] How do you see conversion activity representing today the growth algorithm over the next call it 12 months to 24 months? Obviously, they will be used to augment or could you kind of see that extroversion percentage [indiscernible] kind of peeking out the next two years.\nChris Nassetta: I think I got all that, you are kind of cutting in and out. So I\u2019ll answer what I think I heard. And if I missed something, come back and remind me. So in terms of NUG, we feel the same way we have felt over the last couple of quarters. We obviously delivered a little bit better at 5.1%, because we had a huge fourth quarter in terms of deliveries. But we\u2019ve said over the next few years, we think we\u2019ll deliver 4% to 5% and I still feel really good about that. I think this year, it\u2019ll probably be more the mid-point to the high end of that, again \u2013 similar to last year, but I think over the next years we feel comfortable with that. And in part, leading to what I heard is the second part of your question is a success that we\u2019re having on the conversion side. We\u2019ve always been focused on conversions and in downturns, as everybody knows, that\u2019s very fertile ground. Over the past five or six years, we\u2019ve gone from having essentially one conversion brand, really that was the big engine, which was DoubleTree to now having four, between our three soft brands and DoubleTree, all of which are producing for us. And I think we\u2019ll continue to escalate. I mentioned it my prepared comments, our signings for conversions were up 30% last year, our starts which I did not mention, probably should have were up 40%, and our fourth quarter, our opens were up about 44%. So what you see happening is sort of natural, like, it takes a little bit of time to ramp, you\u2019re right. We were circa 20% of overall NUG in conversions. That was up 300 or 400 basis points versus the prior year. And I think what you\u2019ll see over the next few years is that will become a larger and larger component of overall NUG. How high will it go, which maybe would be the next question. So I\u2019ll answer it unclear. I mean, we \u2013 in the great recession, it went into the 40s. I don\u2019t think it will go that high, because I honestly think we have so many other engines firing, particularly in China with all of our limited service growth, as compared to the great recession. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll go that higher, but I think it could clearly go into the upper 20s, low 30s over the next few years. And so we have tremendous amount of focus on it, as you would guess. And the development teams are aligned around those goals. And I think you are starting to see with some of the numbers that I described, the natural ramp up in that and very, very good progress there. So I think things are coming along really nicely. Did I miss anything in your question?\nCarlo Santarelli: No. Thanks very much.\nChris Nassetta: Thanks, Carlo.\nOperator: The next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. And thanks for all the remarks. Chris or Kevin, maybe sort of going down the same path as you just did for net units on digging in on the G&A cadence a little bit \u2013 a little bit more. Obviously, I think there\u2019s some noise with stock-based comp, but Chris, I think you referred to overall kind of cash expense savings in a higher margin profile restructure looking out a few years. Could you just help us kind of build on that a little bit as you kind of look out a little further? What\u2019s either the right run rate to think about relative to 2019 levels for 2021? Or just maybe even more strategically, how much more efficient, do you think we are a few years out from now versus where we end to 2019.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Shaun, I\u2019ll take that one. I think, you sort of pointed out some of it right on the GAAP G&A side, includes stock comp that\u2019s non-cash, right. So over the course of last year, we wrote down our plans and then we put in a new plan in place in the fourth quarter. So you saw some things bounce around and then overall it ended up at 30%. On a cash basis, we ended up, I can\u2019t remember, if Chris, you said this in your first answer, but on a cash basis, we ended up about 20% better 2020 over 2019. And then I know Chris did say this, we think 2021 versus 2019, we\u2019ll be down in the mid-teens on a cash basis. And so how can that trend going forward? It didn\u2019t look overall wages and benefits have been growing in excess of core inflation over time, that\u2019s probably not going to trend. But we\u2019ve \u2013 look, we\u2019re adding no new heads in the business this year. And so we think for several years, we\u2019re going to remain disciplined as we always have and there\u2019s no reason to think that we can\u2019t grow cash overhead at sort of slightly ahead of inflation. There\u2019s slightly more than inflation, because that\u2019s probably what wages and benefits wants to grow over the next few years. And there\u2019s nothing that we see in the future that says we can\u2019t continue to get back to scaling the business without having step changes in growth in overhead.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone. Good to hear everyone\u2019s voices.\nChris Nassetta: You too, David.\nDavid Katz: Thank you. Chris, in your comments, you talked about pent-up demand for corporate travel and you made some comments around group. And I\u2019m hoping that you might be able to go just a little bit further and talk about how broad based that might be any industries, et cetera. It\u2019s obviously quite intuitive that leisure would have a lot of pent-up demand, but we spend a lot of time debating those other segments and would just love a little more depth if you have it available.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I can give you \u2013 I\u2019ll give you what I do have. I mean, I talked about in my prepared comments, David, the leisure side and I think we all \u2013 I think we can all kind of stipulate that people want to get out of their basements and they want to travel. And while people have been starting to do that, not that many have and certainly the higher end leisure business says has not really been out and about. And so I think, as you get through, what is it going to be a mass vaccination period of time over the next 90 days. I think when you get to late spring and summer, everything I\u2019m hearing, talking to the Biden administration, which you\u2019re now reading in the papers too, but we\u2019re having pretty direct conversations. I think maybe even sooner, I think the President said last night, I heard that, by the end of July, every American will be able to be vaccinated. My own belief based if you look at the manufacturing curve and expectation of J&J getting approved probably by the end of this month that could be much \u2013 that could be sooner than the middle of the summer. So I think once you get there, I think people have a lot of savings, even though they\u2019ve been buying stuff like crazy, as we know, because a lot of the retail and car business and homes and all that have been doing well. They want to get out more than ever talk to anybody \u2013 talk to any of your friends and you get the answer. So I think the trend line there will be quite good, when you get a bit of the all clear sign, which I think will be hopefully by spring, certainly no worse than summer. On that business transient, there are data points. I mean, but a lot of it is admittedly anecdotal in the sense of just discussions that we\u2019re having with our big customers and trends that we\u2019re seeing. And as we\u2019re having discussions with our customers, as we\u2019ve been renegotiating, all of our corporate negotiated counts. I mean, clearly, there is massive pent-up demand. I mean, they may \u2013 they\u2019re obviously in businesses that are hurting, they\u2019re going to have cutbacks for maybe their run rate numbers of 2018 and 2019. But the reality is, they\u2019re in the short term, they have so many things that they need to do when you talk to them about collecting their people, innovation, just team meetings, getting out with clients and customers and the like that, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s been over a year. By the time, they\u2019re out a little bit 15 months and forget the fact they want to see people, they need to see people. And so you\u2019re starting to see that, even though we\u2019re in the \u2013 you see the infection rates coming down, I mean, we\u2019re still not through the crisis for sure. And you starting to see it in the booking trends. I mean, the business transient trends are clearly sort of week by week are marching up, even in the middle of all this, even though we don\u2019t have the all \u2013 an all clear sign. So not tons of data other than well, real booking data suggests, short-term, it\u2019s moving the right direction, but lots of conversations with customers are saying that in lots of surveying that we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s suggesting, like, it was \u2013 the people are more interested in travel for leisure and business, as our pulling is like over 80% of them say they got to get back out on the road, which is the highest number. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen since this mess began. So that\u2019s good on the group side, that\u2019s going to take longer, but the trend lines are good. If you look at like our lead volume, sort of fourth quarter versus January, January was up 35%. If you look at it, January versus December was up 50%, I give you the quarter because normally January would step up from December because of the holidays. So I want to \u2013 I think a better number would probably be sort of the average over the whole fourth quarter. But that\u2019s up by more than a third, a stat that I \u2013 as I go through with the team that I thought was very encouraging on the group side, was that our first half position for 2021 versus 2019. So let\u2019s forget 2020, because it was a washout. I mean, the comparability is not relevant. If you look at it versus the stabilize here of 2019, first half position on the group side system-wide is down 80%. The second half of the year versus the second half of 2019 is down by 32%. So again, it\u2019s still off, but by a lot lesser margin and that\u2019s a result of people saying I got to get out, I want to get out. I got to have team meetings. I got to have small group, medium-sized group, conventions are starting to book again, because they\u2019re going to go out of business if they don\u2019t get booking again. With an expectation, obviously, by the time you get to the second half of the year that it\u2019s safe. And they can do it from a health point of view and so we need the \u2013 my belief is we will get there, but we need this vaccination effort between now and June, July to really ramp up. And it feels like day-by-day that\u2019s happening. So that\u2019s a little bit of color, obviously, we got to play out the next few months and have the right things fall into place. But I think there\u2019s a real opportunity for this, I said this publicly, I think Bloomberg or Summer, but I do think there\u2019s a great opportunity for the second half of the year to be better than any of us think. Because it\u2019s like everything, when you\u2019re at the top of the cycle, we think everything\u2019s going to stay good forever. And it\u2019s a new norm. And when you\u2019re looking from the bottom, the depths of doom you\u2019re sort of trend lining off a lot of negativity and eventually this things going to flip and people want to get out no matter what anybody says, they want to travel. And when the all clear sign is sort of given, which is the lights at the end of the tunnel, and I think coming soon. I think there\u2019s a huge amount of pent-up demand. And I think we could all like what we see in the second half of the year.\nDavid Katz: Appreciate it. And if I may just a very quick follow-up. On the subject of hybrid segment or bleisure, any thought, strategies or marketing efforts to that end?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, all of our efforts on the marketing side, I mean, to keep it short and simple, if we can let other folks that ask questions, all of our efforts have been focused on fishing where the fish are. And right now, where the fish are at the moment is in sort of value based leisure and bleisure business. So and it\u2019s really the bleisure part of it is small businesses that really don\u2019t have the choice, but to travel to keep their businesses going. And they are sort of mixing it with leisure opportunities, because they have more mobility in a sense, they\u2019re not locked into their kids aren\u2019t locked into necessarily being in schools and they\u2019re not locked into being in an office. So all of our efforts across what we\u2019re doing with honors, what we\u2019re doing with promotions, what we\u2019re doing with our marketing spend have been focused on that. Now that\u2019s all going to obviously shift. If all goes well and I\u2019m right, you\u2019ll \u2013 and we\u2019re obviously working on the plans to not go immediately back to where we were, but to start to migrate back to sort of a more normal approach as demand patterns become more normalized.\nDavid Katz: Thanks very much. Good luck.\nChris Nassetta: Yes.\nOperator: Next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning.\nStephen Grambling: On your comments on the second half 2021 trends, those are all helpful. Perhaps coming at from another angle, how did leisure business and group segments fair in China in the fourth quarter before incremental lockdowns? And how would you compare and contrast that market to the U.S. as you think about how it may inform the trajectory of recovery once cases are reined in. And perhaps as a related follow-up, are you seeing any signs of that substitution of trips that you were referencing in that market?\nChris Nassetta: Obviously China, as you\u2019ve implied in your question, sort of backed up with what\u2019s going on, particularly in the North of China, more than the South of China in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, I would say I don\u2019t have all the data in front of me, but I would say the anecdotally from lots of conversations with our Asia-Pac and our China team, it was very rapidly sort of approaching normalcy meaning we weren\u2019t fully back with there was still a little bit heavier leisure component, but there always is in China, by the way. I mean it\u2019s a heavier leisure market broadly, but we weren\u2019t too terribly far off of our business transient and our group trends, but it was following the same pattern I would expect here. Leisure leads business transient is a close second. And the groups just because by nature group business a little bit longer, lead time is a little bit more planning was lagging a bit. But they \u2013 China \u2013 we were running like 10 points off, something like that. So we were getting before they backed up. We were getting to I think very normalized levels of demand. We were not seeing any material as far as we could tell with the data we had any sort of substitution effect. Reality is China was sort of going back to the normal trends that it had very rapidly before COVID. And so I think while China is different in lots of ways, I think humans are humans. And I think it\u2019s why my belief is that as we sort of come out of this leisure will lead, business transient will be a fast follow, group will take a little bit longer to develop, because lead times, but the demand patterns will over a couple of years return and look a lot like they did pre-COVID.\nStephen Grambling: And one very quick follow-up, just can you remind us what percentage of the China business is normally international inbound, which I imagine you\u2019d have to overcome to get to that 10 points off.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. It\u2019s about 10 points, 10%.\nStephen Grambling: Awesome. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll jump back in queue.\nChris Nassetta: Yes.\nOperator: Next question will be from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBill Crow: Good morning, Chris and Kevin.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning, Bill.\nKevin Jacobs: Good morning, Bill.\nBill Crow: I got a two-parter on unit growth if I might. The first part of it is simply are there economic differences to Hilton between adding a conversion DoubleTree or say opening a Hampton Inn that has newly built and maybe that\u2019s a year one versus a year three question?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, I mean the difference is \u2013 I think you already answered sort of imply. It\u2019s just timing. I mean conversions just happened faster most of not always in the year for the year, but typically between signing and getting them in the system and paying fees that happens very rapidly usually within 6 months to 12 months and signing of new builds depending on where in the world you are takes anywhere from 12 months to 48 months. And so conversions produce faster. I\u2019d say in terms of ramps and underlying economics, I mean looking at Kevin runs development that\u2019s not a material difference as I think about it. I don\u2019t have the data in front of me, but anecdotally we\u2019re involved. Kevin and I were involved in all these deals. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real difference in terms of, I think it just comes faster. I think the basic fee structures are quite similar.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, that\u2019s right. I just think to DoubleTree\u2019s 10 \u2013 DoubleTree\u2019s are full service hotels, so its market specific, but the absolute level of these tends to be a little bit higher, but generally speaking the return profile is very similar.\nBill Crow: Perfect, perfect. The follow-up or the second part is whether you think the $15 national minimum wage would impact development economics for select service say your Tru hotels, which tend to be in smaller markets where maybe the labor rate is much lower.\nChris Nassetta: It could, I\u2019ve been talking to lots of folks about this issue. And broadly, I think many including me are supportive over time that the minimum wage needs to move up. But as I said to a number of people in the administration time and place sort of how you do it and when you do it matters. And so I think the likely outcome is, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll end up in this first bill. I do think that there, I think that is probably not highly likely based on what I\u2019m hearing possible, but not highly likely, but it will not be an issue that goes away. And I think that the how and the when then become important. And so how being that first of all, even in what\u2019s being proposed now, it\u2019s not all to $15, it\u2019s staged in over basically five years. And so I think that that creates a ramp that allows people to adjust and create, we\u2019re obviously working with our owners on creating even more efficiencies. So it\u2019s not like overnight, you go across the country to $15, by the way, there are a whole bunch of markets that are already $15. And so they\u2019ve been dealing with it. I would also like to think that with people really spend the time figuring it out that not every market\u2019s the same that living in Poughkeepsie is not the same as living in New York City. And that these can be index. And then when do you start to sort of move it up, I think is a big issue. My personal worry and concern is the hospitality industry has been more impacted from a jobs point of view than any industry in the country. And it\u2019s the slowest in recovery in terms of bringing jobs back. And I don\u2019t think raising the minimum wage, no matter how you look at the analysis is going to help. I think it will slow the rehiring of people in the industry. And so I am hopeful that in the end that people will be rational, rational thinking will prevail. And as a result, this will not be a major issue, certainly in the short to intermediate term. I think we should all assume that the minimum wage is going to be going up over time. In fact, because it needs to, but again, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I am hopeful that it will be done in a staged way. And there\u2019ll be other mechanisms built in to the timing and the geographical approach that, that will make it make sense on all sides. So the short \u2013 that\u2019s a long answer Bill. The short answer is I don\u2019t think in the short to intermediate term there\u2019s any meaningful impact as a result of it.\nBill Crow: Great.\nKevin Jacobs: And Bill I\u2019ll just add, I mean that obviously covers the ground on the issue really well. I\u2019ll just add as a quick plug for our products, right. And so our products on a relative basis, if you start with revenue premiums, and then our more modern prototypical, particularly you referenced Tru that even though if minimum \u2013 if wage and benefits costs go up, that does make it more expensive for developers, but on a relative basis, our products are more efficient. So it should continue to give us an opportunity to differentiate ourselves from a product perspective.\nChris Nassetta: And the last point not to hit it too hard is that the work we\u2019re doing right now in every one of our brands including Tru and Hampton everything else is about taking \u2013 making them higher margin businesses and taking \u2013 creating more labor efficiencies, particularly in the areas of housekeeping, food and beverage and other areas. So they\u2019re going to \u2013 when we get out of the crisis, those businesses will be higher margin and require less labor than they did pre-COVID. So that will also sort of factored for in my commentary. But I think that hopefully the net of it is as it goes up, it\u2019s done over a longer period of time and it\u2019s done in a sort of thoughtful way.\nBill Crow: Thank you for your time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning, Patrick.\nPatrick Scholes: My question \u2013 morning, morning. I\u2019m curious as to your interest at the moment in tuck-in brand acquisitions today versus sort of your historical normal strategy of building a brand from scratch, specifically interested in perhaps buying international brands or international private brands. Thank you.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. And good question. And one, we certainly \u2013 we get frequently. I don\u2019t think my views changed at all. I mean I think I\u2019ve been saying for 13 years, since we bought nothing, we\u2019ve doubled. We\u2019ve gone from a family of nine brands to 18 brands. So we\u2019ve doubled it and in the time I\u2019ve been here and we haven\u2019t bought one of them. We\u2019ve organically developed every single one of them. So for my entire time here, I\u2019ve been saying, never say never, right. You\u2019ve heard my speech. If it passes all the right filters, we\u2019d consider it, but nothing has. And so I think not necessarily the past is indicative of the future, but it sort of tells you our predisposition. And so I would say never say never, but the filter is a very tight filtration system, which is we think we got the best brand portfolio in the business. We think that is \u2013 that can be proven, scientifically by the fact that every one of our brands is a market share leader. Everyone that we\u2019ve developed we think is purpose built around exactly what customers want. And we like that. And so anything that we would look to acquire would have that sort of meet that profile like we don\u2019t want to go backwards, because we don\u2019t have to. We have pretty much every category covered. If something\u2019s not covered, we could launch it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us launch a whole lot of new brands in the short-term. But why would we do that? We have all the segments generally covered. Do we want to cover, we have the best brands, why would we pick up something that wasn\u2019t super curb in the same way that we then have to be distracted trying to fix. And that we paid a lot of money for the \u2013 yes, which leads me to the next filter, which is economics. If you do simple math, we\u2019re developing these brands for nothing, not to make it. And so we have an infinite yield every time we do it, every time we do it through where a home to, and these things become mega brands, they become billion, multi-billion dollar businesses over time. It\u2019s an infinite return because we\u2019ve effectively invest just sweat equity, so something but not much. So when we look at buying stuff, we haven\u2019t found anything that is perfect, that doesn\u2019t require a lot of elbow grease. And you\u2019re paying a lot of money for it. So we just not again never say never, but that\u2019s sort of how we think about it now your comment \u2013 your question also implied like region sort of regional process that that\u2019s where maybe I hate to say it and have it become a headline, because I think the likelihood is we\u2019re not going to do that, but there are sort of smaller regional brands and places where maybe we want a stronger foothold that aren\u2019t \u2013 that don\u2019t show up a whole lot on the radar, but for what they are very, very good. And so, yes, we\u2019ve looked at a bunch of those over time. And we will continue to do that. The net result has been while we\u2019ve looked at a bunch of them, we haven\u2019t done any. And again, I would say I would condition everybody to say, we like what we got. We think we got the no offense to our competitors. Maybe we had the best set up for the future in the industry. And the last thing we want to do is botch it by either bringing brands that like my father used to say, you hang with the dogs, you get the fleas. We don\u2019t want to bring stuff. We don\u2019t want to bring stuff in that, that messes up the portfolio and we\u2019re intensely focused on good capital allocation. I was \u2013 that those are my origins in business being a good capital allocator. And so when you put it together, I think not high likelihood, but never \u2013 not never impossible.\nPatrick Scholes: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you. I\u2019m actually have two half questions since are both follow-ups. One is just on the group commentary and you talked about how much better the second half looks. I\u2019ve got to think that for 2022, there will be group events that haven\u2019t at that point taken place in three years. I\u2019ve got to think your volume for 2022 would be better than 2019. Is it just too early to see that on your growth?\nChris Nassetta: Its too early. I think when we get into the second half of this year, that my own belief, I should hardly say this, but it\u2019s like I said to our team the other day do not give away space in 2022 too cheap, like because I think there\u2019s going to be gargantuan demand. And as a result, more pricing power than people think, just because you people have accumulated all sorts of needs that are going to get released and it takes time to plan. So what you\u2019re going to see in the second half of this year is I think the big uptake will be in the SMERF business, because those are smaller groups they can have the planning is not as time consuming, the lead times are. The big stuff, it takes time when you\u2019re doing a thousand person or multi-thousand person conventions. Even if you\u2019re doing its hybrid, it takes a lot of planning. And so that\u2019s really almost at this point got to start to fall in the next year or so. Yes. I think if all goes according to plan in the first half of this year with vaccinations and there\u2019s a reality that, that people feel like they can start to congregate again being intelligent about it, but do it in a safe way. I think you\u2019ll \u2013 in the second half of this year, you\u2019ll see a bunch of demand that will dump into next year on stuff that requires planning.\nRobin Farley: Great, super helpful. And then my other follow-up was on the unit growth comments. And I think your comments about next year were maybe better than what some had worried about maybe 2021 is benefiting from some of the construction in 2020 that had been delayed. So I guess when you talked about 4% to 5% for the next few years and this year being at the higher end of that. Does that sound like that maybe 2022 would be at the lower end leaner that there\u2019s maybe going to be a little bit of an air pocket for new development that would have started in the last 12 months? Is that how we should kind of think about those?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I don\u2019t think it would be that low. I think we are definitely, I mean we had 5.1% last year. We delivered a lot more than we thought. This is we look at this year, there\u2019s a lot of stuff in production. We think again we have really good momentum on conversions, which is going to help us more this year than last it\u2019ll help again, even more so in 2022. And then there\u2019s just stuff that\u2019s moving through that was under construction or was put under construction. That\u2019s going to help us. I think next year, I mean we still \u2013 we put 75,000 rooms under construction last year, and most of that is not going to deliver this year. It\u2019s going to deliver into next. And as I said, we\u2019re ramping on conversion. So I do think that 2022 could be lower than 2021, but not by the degree that that you\u2019re suggesting. I still think that ultimately our goal was to be sort of in that 4% to 5% range in all those years.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nChris Nassetta: Yes.\nOperator: Next question will be from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of questions on your conversations with owners. I used to talk about some upsides on the take rate as you sort of rolled contracts over. Just wondering as we\u2019ve gone through this pandemic, are you able to enact on that and push the sort of fee percentages up. And also you gave them some CapEx holidays and how urgent is it they kind of begin that renovation process and when would you expect that to restart.\nChris Nassetta: Both good questions. So on the first, our published rates, you would say if you average all our brands it\u2019s about 5.6% and license fees, we\u2019re about 5% right now in terms of effective rate, in terms of where people are in the cycle. I \u2013 we\u2019re not going to anytime soon be increasing those rates in an absolute sense, but by definition, every time a contract turns, it goes to the new rate. I think I\u2019m not saying anybody likes it, but that\u2019s sort of the standard, the standard within the industry. It\u2019s certainly what we\u2019ve always done and we\u2019ll continue to do that. So you\u2019ll see that sort of grind up about 10, 15 basis points a year. And then when we get to the other side of this, depending on the economics and ultimate market share and all those things, obviously we can look at what we do with our fee structures, but we\u2019re going to sort of keep, we think that they are good where they are and we\u2019ll keep our effective rates will keep grinding up as you have natural rollover. On the CapEx side, it\u2019s really important. It\u2019s a delicate balance. The obvious one, which is you got to keep the portfolio. We have the market share leaders in every one of these categories. Part of that is obviously service, a part of its product. And part of that product is about having fresh product, consistent high quality product. We\u2019re very religious about it. We have given a lot of relief. Thankfully, we went into the crisis in a really good position, because we\u2019ve been unbelievably diligent and disciplined. And our owner community over time has recognized that to get those premiums. They have to keep their assets up. And so we went into the crisis a year ago in a good place, we have the ability we think to give them a bit of grace for a period of time and not have a significant impact with our customer base. But as we get to the other side of this, yes, we\u2019re going to have to get back to having that kind of discipline, which is not just in our interest. It\u2019s in our owners\u2019 interest, if they want to continue to drive results. I suspect that that\u2019s going to be next year and not this year. Just in the sense that while I think the second half we\u2019re going to be in a very different world, we got to \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to let folks get back on their feet. And I think given again, the quality of \u2013 on average of our brands and the upkeep of those the brands and the individual hotels going into this, I think we can do that without it being harmful.\nRichard Clarke: Wonderful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question will be from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks.\nChris Nassetta: Hey Smedes.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, I want to just follow-up on you talked about some of the group bookings improving sequentially, and I know it\u2019s too early to talk about 2022, but on your patterns that you\u2019re seeing, is there anything just from a geographic perspective in the U.S. that\u2019s showing up so far in terms of maybe shifting away from higher costs cities that had already been underperforming from a RevPAR perspective in pandemic into lower cost?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. The geography is exactly what I think you\u2019re following in the question and what you would think, it right now is less in the primary markets and more in the secondary and tertiary, just because of what\u2019s been going on in a lot of the big cities and the greater density of population. And reality is, as I said a lot of the uptick that we\u2019re seeing into the second half of the year is SMERF business. And the nature of that business lends itself more and more to those geographies. I fully expect as I said when we sort of get a bit of the all clear and people start to think about group in a very different way. And I hope that\u2019s in the second half of the year, you\u2019ll start to see those patterns normalize. But given that it is more in the SMERF segment it by definition ends up being more disproportionately outside of the big urban centers as compared to normal demand patterns at the moment.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you. And then just a very quick follow-up, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but what was the impairment charge that you took in the quarter that was in an add back it\u2019s just from the one that was related to.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, mostly in almost entirely in the ownership segment means we \u2013 this was announced in the pre-announcement for the bond deal as well on what we thought it was going to be both mostly goodwill related to the ownership segment that just having to do with the duration of the crisis and the recoverability of those assets and I\u2019ll let you all on cash.\nSmedes Rose: Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Again, thank you guys for joining us today. 2020 will go in the record books for sure. Not the greatest year for our company in our 101-year history or the industry certainly. But as I said in my prepared comments, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish. We think the businesses in a terrific position. We are certainly of the mind and hopeful as I\u2019ve described in many ways that as we get to spring summer, and certainly in the second half of the year, we\u2019re going to be in a very different place. And we\u2019ll look forward after the first quarter, which will get us to the early spring to hopefully be able to comment on those positive trends. Thanks, again, and everybody stay well.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to echo Chris's sentiments about Arne, my thoughts are certainly with his family and with my many friends at Marriott, who I know are hurting this morning. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 59.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis as the pandemic continued to disrupt the demand environment. Relative to the third quarter, occupancy was modestly lower, partially due to seasonality and further tempered by rising COVID cases and associated travel restrictions. Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million in the fourth quarter, down 65% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management and franchise fees decreased 50% less than RevPAR decreased as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better than expected honors license fees and development fees. Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. For the full year, our corporate G&A expenses were down nearly 30% year-over-year at the high end of our expectations. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging demand environment, temporary closures in Europe and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our lease properties. Continued cost control measures coupled with one-time items, mitigated segment losses. For the quarter, diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.10. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to enhance our liquidity position and preserve our financial flexibility. Over the last few months, we opportunistically refinanced $3.4 billion of senior notes to extend our maturities at lower rates. In January, we also repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. On a pro forma basis, taking these transactions into effect as of year-end 2020, we've lowered our weighted average cost of debt to 3.6% and extended our weighted average maturity to 7.2 years. We have no major debt maturities until 2024 and maintain a wealth staggered maturity later thereafter. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please? Yes, Shaun, I'll take that one. I think, you sort of pointed out some of it right on the GAAP G&A side, includes stock comp that's non-cash, right. So over the course of last year, we wrote down our plans and then we put in a new plan in place in the fourth quarter. So you saw some things bounce around and then overall it ended up at 30%. On a cash basis, we ended up, I can't remember, if Chris, you said this in your first answer, but on a cash basis, we ended up about 20% better 2020 over 2019. And then I know Chris did say this, we think 2021 versus 2019, we'll be down in the mid-teens on a cash basis. And so how can that trend going forward? It didn't look overall wages and benefits have been growing in excess of core inflation over time, that's probably not going to trend. But we've \u2013 look, we're adding no new heads in the business this year. And so we think for several years, we're going to remain disciplined as we always have and there's no reason to think that we can't grow cash overhead at sort of slightly ahead of inflation. There's slightly more than inflation, because that's probably what wages and benefits wants to grow over the next few years. And there's nothing that we see in the future that says we can't continue to get back to scaling the business without having step changes in growth in overhead. Good morning, Bill. Yes, that's right. I just think to DoubleTree's 10 \u2013 DoubleTree's are full service hotels, so its market specific, but the absolute level of these tends to be a little bit higher, but generally speaking the return profile is very similar. And Bill I'll just add, I mean that obviously covers the ground on the issue really well. I'll just add as a quick plug for our products, right. And so our products on a relative basis, if you start with revenue premiums, and then our more modern prototypical, particularly you referenced Tru that even though if minimum \u2013 if wage and benefits costs go up, that does make it more expensive for developers, but on a relative basis, our products are more efficient. So it should continue to give us an opportunity to differentiate ourselves from a product perspective. Yes, mostly in almost entirely in the ownership segment means we \u2013 this was announced in the pre-announcement for the bond deal as well on what we thought it was going to be both mostly goodwill related to the ownership segment that just having to do with the duration of the crisis and the recoverability of those assets and I'll let you all on cash. Sure."

            "content": "Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you all joining us today and I hope everybody is staying well. I want to start with something difficult. I want to start by extending my most heartfelt condolences to the Sorenson family and the thousands of Marriott associates around the world following the heartbreaking news of Arne's passing. To say I'm deeply saddened by that loss. It would be an understatement. I as many of had the opportunity to work with Arne in a number of capacities throughout my career, including earlier on at host. I think it's very fair to say he was an exceptional leader, but also an incredible person and a great friend. Our industry is better, because of him and I am a better professional and a better person, because of him. On behalf of everyone at Hilton family and the entire Marriott family are in our thoughts. As we all know this past year has presented unique challenges, including a pandemic that devastated lives, communities and businesses across the world, widespread economic declines and acts of social injustice. Due to the extraordinary levels of disruption, our industry experience demand declines we've never seen before in our 101-year history. Guided by our founding purpose to make the world a better place through the light and warmth of hospitality we acted quickly to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our people. We also took steps to protect our business by rightsizing our cost structure and enhancing our liquidity position while continuing to drive net unit growth and increase our network effect. As a result of these news, we expect to recover from the pandemic as a stronger higher margin business that is even better positioned to deliver performance for our owners and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. While it's certainly been a very difficult year, we're proud of everything we've accomplished, but we certainly could not have done it without the support of all of our stakeholders. For that, I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of our loyal customers, our important owner partners, our communities who supported us and enabled us to support them, our team members who gave their hearts and souls to our business and our shareholders who stood by us. Because of our amazing people, we've been able to lean on our award-winning culture, which earned the number one best place to work in the United States for the second consecutive year and the number three world's best workplace to help get us through these trying times. Turning to results for the full year system-wide RevPAR declined 57% with adjusted EBITDA down only modestly more illustrating the resiliency of our fee-based model. We also demonstrate the strength of our brands and power of our customer centric strategy by achieving market share gains across every region even in a distressed business environment. For the quarter system-wide RevPAR declined 59% relatively in line with our expectations. The positive momentum and demand that we saw through the summer and early fall was disrupted in November, December by rising COVID cases, tightening travel restrictions and further hotel suspensions, particularly in Europe. Similar to the third quarter drive to leisure travel drove an outsized portion of demand. Business transient and group trends showed modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter, but overall demand remained quite muted. As we look to the year ahead, we remain optimistic that accelerating vaccine distribution will lead to easing government restrictions and unlocked pent-up travel demand for the first quarter overall trends so far appear to be similar to the fourth quarter with modest increases in demand in the U.S. offsetting stalled recoveries in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We expect improving fundamentals heading into spring with essentially all system-wide rooms reopened by the end of the second quarter. We expect a more pronounced recovery in the back half of the year driven by increased leisure demand and meet meaningful rebounds, and corporate transient and group business. Over the last year, the personal savings rate in the United States has nearly doubled increasing by more than $1.6 trillion to $2.9 trillion with the potential to go even higher given additional stimulus. We expect this to drive greater leisure demand as travel restrictions ease and markets reopened a tourism. Additionally, conversations with our large corporate customers along with sequential upticks in business transient booking pace year-to-date indicate that there is pent-up demand for business travel that should drive a recovery in corporate transient trends as the year progress. On the group side, we saw meaningful step up in new group demand in January with our back half group position showing significant sequential improvement versus the first half of the year. With roughly 70% of bookings made within a week of travel, overall visibility remains limited. However, we continue to see signs of optimism. In fact, the vast majority of our large corporate accounts agreed to extend 2020 negotiated rates into this year. Despite the challenges in 2020, we up in more than 400 hotels, totaling nearly 56,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.1% slightly ahead of guidance. Fourth quarter openings were up nearly 30% year-over-year, largely driven by new development in China, where our focus service brands continue to command a disproportionate share of industry growth. We also celebrated our 1 million through milestone and the openings of our 300th hotel in China, our 600th DoubleTree hotel and our 900th Hilton Garden Inn. We ended up the year with 397,000 rooms in our development pipeline up 3% year-over-year. While our market disruption wait on new development signings, conversion signings increased more than 30% versus the prior year. As owners looked a benefit from the strength of our network, we anticipate continued positive momentum and conversion activity, particularly through DoubleTree and our Collection brands. During the quarter, we signed agreements to expand our Curio Collection in Mexico and bring our Tapestry Collection to Portugal. This marks one of several new Tapestry hotels scheduled to open across Europe this year. We also announced plans to debut LXR in the Seychelles with Mango House Seychelles, the property will deliver a truly unique hospitality experience with spacious guestrooms and suites and five world-class food and beverage venues. Schedule to open in the coming months, the hotel underscores our commitment to further expanding our resort portfolio. Building on that momentum, we kicked off 2021 with an agreement to bring LXR to Bali. Additionally, we celebrated the opening of Oceana Santa Monica, which marked LXR is U.S. debut as well as the Waldorf Astoria, Monarch Beach Resort and the Hilton Vancouver Downtown, which was converted from a competitor brand. With these notable openings and many exciting development opportunities in front of us, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering solid growth over the next several years. The pandemic rapidly change guest behaviors, priorities and concerns, we listened to our customers and move quickly to launch modifications to our Honors Loyalty Program, deliver industry leading standards of cleanliness and hygiene with Hilton CleanStay and provide flexible distraction-free environments for remote work with workspaces by Hilton. Additionally, with an even stronger focus on recovery last month, we implemented Hilton EventReady Hybrid Solutions and expanded set of resources to help event planners address the dramatic shift towards hybrid meetings as group business rebound. Our flexibility and innovation drove continued growth in our honors network, ending the year with more than 112 million members who accounted for approximately 60% of system-wide occupancy. Throughout 2020, we also remain focused on our corporate responsibility and our commitment to our ESG initiatives. We're proud to contribute to our communities and we're honored to be named the global industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. In a year marked by challenge and change, we effectively executed our crisis response strategy, carefully manage key stakeholder relationships and continue to press forward on strategic opportunities. I'm confident that there are brighter days ahead and that we are in a stronger, more resilient and we are better positioned than ever before. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the fourth quarter and the full year. Good morning, Joe. Yes, it's a great question. And so a lot to unpack there. But I think, Joe, when you go out and obviously you could debate this and I've debated it ad nauseam with a lot of people. I think if you go out three years, whatever, three or four years, I think demand is going to look a lot like it did in 2017, 2018 and 2019. And meaning the makeup of the business as between business transient, leisure transient and group at that point in time, I think will look quite similar. Now, certain of the types of \u2013 if you get underneath the demand, particularly in business transient and the group side might be for different reasons, then I mean, there'll be a substitution effect clearly in certain types of travel being substituted with sort of the new \u2013 the Zoom calls and digital opportunities. But there'll be replaced with other forms of travel. We've seen this throughout history, I mean, if you go back and it wasn't really around, but the telephone and the internet and telepresence and voicemail, there were always the arguments that this is going to truncate the need to travel and congregate. And the reality is what it typically does is it accelerates it, right. Because it just gives more efficiency. It speeds \u2013 it ultimately speeds things up. It ultimately continues to connect the world and speed up globalization. And as a result, people need to congregate, they need to travel, they need to build relationships, they need to build cultures, they need to innovate. And those things really cannot be done as well without face-to-face opportunities, both in a group setting, as well as individual business travel type needs. And so I \u2013 having done it longer than I'd like to admit, 35, 40 years, we've been debating this. I don't \u2013 again, I think there'll be some substitution effect, but I think it'll look a lot like it did. And then our business a couple of comments since you asked, our business is going to be a better business and a stronger business and a faster growing higher margin business. Why because, listen, throughout the next three years, we're going to continue to grow 4% to 5% unit growth. So we're going to be a bigger company. The units that we had pre COVID, if you believe what I believe, which is you'll have similar demand levels. We'll be producing, like they were. You'll have all these new units that are then going to also be producing and you have a lower cost structure. Because we've taken a significant amount of cost out on a cash basis, sort of, if you look at on a run rate in this year sort of on a cash basis in the mid-teen, something like that, maybe a little bit better. And we're going to be incredibly disciplined as we always have been. I think we've been on a G&A basis, at the low end of spending in the industry, but we got even better last year. And that's going to, when you put all the same flows of fees through the system with more units and a lower cost structure, it's simple math, it's a higher margin business. And so I know, it's sort of an odd time to be pounding the table with optimism. And so I probably shouldn't, but as we sit around this table, I'm at our board table and we talk about it. It's been hard year, the hardest any of us have ever endured, but as a result of it, we put ourselves and about the best position we could have. And honestly, I think the business is going to be better for it. And I think it's going to produce higher margins and more free cash flow, which we're going to be \u2013 which is going to allow us to return even more capital than we were pre-COVID to our shareholders, which you think over the very long-term is going to drive incredible returns. The last point was on limited service, full service, and I'm not \u2013 I'm covering a lot of territory, but you ask these things. And I think it's an important note, because it's something I talked a lot about pre-COVID that, frankly, I don't think got enough attention, which is the megatrend in our \u2013 in the industry, in every market in the world. There is not an exception is the mid-market, right. Why is that? Because, that's where the bulk of the population is, that's where the bulk of the population growth is, particularly in the emerging markets. And so what can those people afford mid-market brands? I would say, I know I'm sort of patting us that. We have the best mid-market brands in the world. I mean, it's being proven out in the growth of those brands, both in the U.S. but outside the U.S., outstripping the competition in Europe, outstripping the competition in Asia Pacific, particularly China. And that's not by luck, we've been very purposeful over the last 10 years and making sure that we take the best brands here, and we adapt those and refine those from a product and service point of view, we picked great development partners, like, we've done in China to make sure that these are adapted to those environments, what the customers want, what the development community in those environments \u2013 in those regions want. That has allowed us to show really strong and growth and continue to. So the megatrend, which was before COVID, and I would say, as a result of the economic distress that this has caused only gets sort of accentuated in a post-COVID world is the mid-market. And I feel really, really good about the work that we've done to put ourselves in a good position. And I think it's showing up in the numbers of our unit growth, right. Because the bulk of that unit, I mean, we have lots of great things going on in luxury, we're making tremendous progress there, lots of great things going on in the upper upscale and all that. But the bulk of \u2013 you see, particularly in this environment, the bulk of the growth all over the world is really coming in limited service. And I've been saying it for years, if you wake up in 20 years and you look back and say, where was the bulk of the growth and demand. And thus the bulk of the growth in rooms, it's going to be in the mid-market. And that's why we've been focused on everything, but so intensely focused in that, because in the end, that's what's going to drive a higher growth rate. That is what having the best brands in that space that we adapt to the local market conditions is what's going to deliver alpha for us, the real alpha over the next 10 or 20 years. Hey, Carlo. Carlo, we can't hear you very well. Could you speak up a little, sorry? Yes, yes, yes. Sorry. I think I got all that, you are kind of cutting in and out. So I'll answer what I think I heard. And if I missed something, come back and remind me. So in terms of NUG, we feel the same way we have felt over the last couple of quarters. We obviously delivered a little bit better at 5.1%, because we had a huge fourth quarter in terms of deliveries. But we've said over the next few years, we think we'll deliver 4% to 5% and I still feel really good about that. I think this year, it'll probably be more the mid-point to the high end of that, again \u2013 similar to last year, but I think over the next years we feel comfortable with that. And in part, leading to what I heard is the second part of your question is a success that we're having on the conversion side. We've always been focused on conversions and in downturns, as everybody knows, that's very fertile ground. Over the past five or six years, we've gone from having essentially one conversion brand, really that was the big engine, which was DoubleTree to now having four, between our three soft brands and DoubleTree, all of which are producing for us. And I think we'll continue to escalate. I mentioned it my prepared comments, our signings for conversions were up 30% last year, our starts which I did not mention, probably should have were up 40%, and our fourth quarter, our opens were up about 44%. So what you see happening is sort of natural, like, it takes a little bit of time to ramp, you're right. We were circa 20% of overall NUG in conversions. That was up 300 or 400 basis points versus the prior year. And I think what you'll see over the next few years is that will become a larger and larger component of overall NUG. How high will it go, which maybe would be the next question. So I'll answer it unclear. I mean, we \u2013 in the great recession, it went into the 40s. I don't think it will go that high, because I honestly think we have so many other engines firing, particularly in China with all of our limited service growth, as compared to the great recession. I don't think it'll go that higher, but I think it could clearly go into the upper 20s, low 30s over the next few years. And so we have tremendous amount of focus on it, as you would guess. And the development teams are aligned around those goals. And I think you are starting to see with some of the numbers that I described, the natural ramp up in that and very, very good progress there. So I think things are coming along really nicely. Did I miss anything in your question? Thanks, Carlo. You too, David. Yes. I can give you \u2013 I'll give you what I do have. I mean, I talked about in my prepared comments, David, the leisure side and I think we all \u2013 I think we can all kind of stipulate that people want to get out of their basements and they want to travel. And while people have been starting to do that, not that many have and certainly the higher end leisure business says has not really been out and about. And so I think, as you get through, what is it going to be a mass vaccination period of time over the next 90 days. I think when you get to late spring and summer, everything I'm hearing, talking to the Biden administration, which you're now reading in the papers too, but we're having pretty direct conversations. I think maybe even sooner, I think the President said last night, I heard that, by the end of July, every American will be able to be vaccinated. My own belief based if you look at the manufacturing curve and expectation of J&J getting approved probably by the end of this month that could be much \u2013 that could be sooner than the middle of the summer. So I think once you get there, I think people have a lot of savings, even though they've been buying stuff like crazy, as we know, because a lot of the retail and car business and homes and all that have been doing well. They want to get out more than ever talk to anybody \u2013 talk to any of your friends and you get the answer. So I think the trend line there will be quite good, when you get a bit of the all clear sign, which I think will be hopefully by spring, certainly no worse than summer. On that business transient, there are data points. I mean, but a lot of it is admittedly anecdotal in the sense of just discussions that we're having with our big customers and trends that we're seeing. And as we're having discussions with our customers, as we've been renegotiating, all of our corporate negotiated counts. I mean, clearly, there is massive pent-up demand. I mean, they may \u2013 they're obviously in businesses that are hurting, they're going to have cutbacks for maybe their run rate numbers of 2018 and 2019. But the reality is, they're in the short term, they have so many things that they need to do when you talk to them about collecting their people, innovation, just team meetings, getting out with clients and customers and the like that, it's just \u2013 it's been over a year. By the time, they're out a little bit 15 months and forget the fact they want to see people, they need to see people. And so you're starting to see that, even though we're in the \u2013 you see the infection rates coming down, I mean, we're still not through the crisis for sure. And you starting to see it in the booking trends. I mean, the business transient trends are clearly sort of week by week are marching up, even in the middle of all this, even though we don't have the all \u2013 an all clear sign. So not tons of data other than well, real booking data suggests, short-term, it's moving the right direction, but lots of conversations with customers are saying that in lots of surveying that we're doing, it's suggesting, like, it was \u2013 the people are more interested in travel for leisure and business, as our pulling is like over 80% of them say they got to get back out on the road, which is the highest number. Obviously, we've seen since this mess began. So that's good on the group side, that's going to take longer, but the trend lines are good. If you look at like our lead volume, sort of fourth quarter versus January, January was up 35%. If you look at it, January versus December was up 50%, I give you the quarter because normally January would step up from December because of the holidays. So I want to \u2013 I think a better number would probably be sort of the average over the whole fourth quarter. But that's up by more than a third, a stat that I \u2013 as I go through with the team that I thought was very encouraging on the group side, was that our first half position for 2021 versus 2019. So let's forget 2020, because it was a washout. I mean, the comparability is not relevant. If you look at it versus the stabilize here of 2019, first half position on the group side system-wide is down 80%. The second half of the year versus the second half of 2019 is down by 32%. So again, it's still off, but by a lot lesser margin and that's a result of people saying I got to get out, I want to get out. I got to have team meetings. I got to have small group, medium-sized group, conventions are starting to book again, because they're going to go out of business if they don't get booking again. With an expectation, obviously, by the time you get to the second half of the year that it's safe. And they can do it from a health point of view and so we need the \u2013 my belief is we will get there, but we need this vaccination effort between now and June, July to really ramp up. And it feels like day-by-day that's happening. So that's a little bit of color, obviously, we got to play out the next few months and have the right things fall into place. But I think there's a real opportunity for this, I said this publicly, I think Bloomberg or Summer, but I do think there's a great opportunity for the second half of the year to be better than any of us think. Because it's like everything, when you're at the top of the cycle, we think everything's going to stay good forever. And it's a new norm. And when you're looking from the bottom, the depths of doom you're sort of trend lining off a lot of negativity and eventually this things going to flip and people want to get out no matter what anybody says, they want to travel. And when the all clear sign is sort of given, which is the lights at the end of the tunnel, and I think coming soon. I think there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And I think we could all like what we see in the second half of the year. Yes. I mean, all of our efforts on the marketing side, I mean, to keep it short and simple, if we can let other folks that ask questions, all of our efforts have been focused on fishing where the fish are. And right now, where the fish are at the moment is in sort of value based leisure and bleisure business. So and it's really the bleisure part of it is small businesses that really don't have the choice, but to travel to keep their businesses going. And they are sort of mixing it with leisure opportunities, because they have more mobility in a sense, they're not locked into their kids aren't locked into necessarily being in schools and they're not locked into being in an office. So all of our efforts across what we're doing with honors, what we're doing with promotions, what we're doing with our marketing spend have been focused on that. Now that's all going to obviously shift. If all goes well and I'm right, you'll \u2013 and we're obviously working on the plans to not go immediately back to where we were, but to start to migrate back to sort of a more normal approach as demand patterns become more normalized. Yes. Good morning. Obviously China, as you've implied in your question, sort of backed up with what's going on, particularly in the North of China, more than the South of China in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, I would say I don't have all the data in front of me, but I would say the anecdotally from lots of conversations with our Asia-Pac and our China team, it was very rapidly sort of approaching normalcy meaning we weren't fully back with there was still a little bit heavier leisure component, but there always is in China, by the way. I mean it's a heavier leisure market broadly, but we weren't too terribly far off of our business transient and our group trends, but it was following the same pattern I would expect here. Leisure leads business transient is a close second. And the groups just because by nature group business a little bit longer, lead time is a little bit more planning was lagging a bit. But they \u2013 China \u2013 we were running like 10 points off, something like that. So we were getting before they backed up. We were getting to I think very normalized levels of demand. We were not seeing any material as far as we could tell with the data we had any sort of substitution effect. Reality is China was sort of going back to the normal trends that it had very rapidly before COVID. And so I think while China is different in lots of ways, I think humans are humans. And I think it's why my belief is that as we sort of come out of this leisure will lead, business transient will be a fast follow, group will take a little bit longer to develop, because lead times, but the demand patterns will over a couple of years return and look a lot like they did pre-COVID. Yes. It's about 10 points, 10%. Yes. Good morning, Bill. Yes, I mean the difference is \u2013 I think you already answered sort of imply. It's just timing. I mean conversions just happened faster most of not always in the year for the year, but typically between signing and getting them in the system and paying fees that happens very rapidly usually within 6 months to 12 months and signing of new builds depending on where in the world you are takes anywhere from 12 months to 48 months. And so conversions produce faster. I'd say in terms of ramps and underlying economics, I mean looking at Kevin runs development that's not a material difference as I think about it. I don't have the data in front of me, but anecdotally we're involved. Kevin and I were involved in all these deals. I don't think there's any real difference in terms of, I think it just comes faster. I think the basic fee structures are quite similar. It could, I've been talking to lots of folks about this issue. And broadly, I think many including me are supportive over time that the minimum wage needs to move up. But as I said to a number of people in the administration time and place sort of how you do it and when you do it matters. And so I think the likely outcome is, I don't know that it'll end up in this first bill. I do think that there, I think that is probably not highly likely based on what I'm hearing possible, but not highly likely, but it will not be an issue that goes away. And I think that the how and the when then become important. And so how being that first of all, even in what's being proposed now, it's not all to $15, it's staged in over basically five years. And so I think that that creates a ramp that allows people to adjust and create, we're obviously working with our owners on creating even more efficiencies. So it's not like overnight, you go across the country to $15, by the way, there are a whole bunch of markets that are already $15. And so they've been dealing with it. I would also like to think that with people really spend the time figuring it out that not every market's the same that living in Poughkeepsie is not the same as living in New York City. And that these can be index. And then when do you start to sort of move it up, I think is a big issue. My personal worry and concern is the hospitality industry has been more impacted from a jobs point of view than any industry in the country. And it's the slowest in recovery in terms of bringing jobs back. And I don't think raising the minimum wage, no matter how you look at the analysis is going to help. I think it will slow the rehiring of people in the industry. And so I am hopeful that in the end that people will be rational, rational thinking will prevail. And as a result, this will not be a major issue, certainly in the short to intermediate term. I think we should all assume that the minimum wage is going to be going up over time. In fact, because it needs to, but again, I think it's \u2013 I am hopeful that it will be done in a staged way. And there'll be other mechanisms built in to the timing and the geographical approach that, that will make it make sense on all sides. So the short \u2013 that's a long answer Bill. The short answer is I don't think in the short to intermediate term there's any meaningful impact as a result of it. And the last point not to hit it too hard is that the work we're doing right now in every one of our brands including Tru and Hampton everything else is about taking \u2013 making them higher margin businesses and taking \u2013 creating more labor efficiencies, particularly in the areas of housekeeping, food and beverage and other areas. So they're going to \u2013 when we get out of the crisis, those businesses will be higher margin and require less labor than they did pre-COVID. So that will also sort of factored for in my commentary. But I think that hopefully the net of it is as it goes up, it's done over a longer period of time and it's done in a sort of thoughtful way. Good morning, Patrick. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. And good question. And one, we certainly \u2013 we get frequently. I don't think my views changed at all. I mean I think I've been saying for 13 years, since we bought nothing, we've doubled. We've gone from a family of nine brands to 18 brands. So we've doubled it and in the time I've been here and we haven't bought one of them. We've organically developed every single one of them. So for my entire time here, I've been saying, never say never, right. You've heard my speech. If it passes all the right filters, we'd consider it, but nothing has. And so I think not necessarily the past is indicative of the future, but it sort of tells you our predisposition. And so I would say never say never, but the filter is a very tight filtration system, which is we think we got the best brand portfolio in the business. We think that is \u2013 that can be proven, scientifically by the fact that every one of our brands is a market share leader. Everyone that we've developed we think is purpose built around exactly what customers want. And we like that. And so anything that we would look to acquire would have that sort of meet that profile like we don't want to go backwards, because we don't have to. We have pretty much every category covered. If something's not covered, we could launch it. I don't think you'll see us launch a whole lot of new brands in the short-term. But why would we do that? We have all the segments generally covered. Do we want to cover, we have the best brands, why would we pick up something that wasn't super curb in the same way that we then have to be distracted trying to fix. And that we paid a lot of money for the \u2013 yes, which leads me to the next filter, which is economics. If you do simple math, we're developing these brands for nothing, not to make it. And so we have an infinite yield every time we do it, every time we do it through where a home to, and these things become mega brands, they become billion, multi-billion dollar businesses over time. It's an infinite return because we've effectively invest just sweat equity, so something but not much. So when we look at buying stuff, we haven't found anything that is perfect, that doesn't require a lot of elbow grease. And you're paying a lot of money for it. So we just not again never say never, but that's sort of how we think about it now your comment \u2013 your question also implied like region sort of regional process that that's where maybe I hate to say it and have it become a headline, because I think the likelihood is we're not going to do that, but there are sort of smaller regional brands and places where maybe we want a stronger foothold that aren't \u2013 that don't show up a whole lot on the radar, but for what they are very, very good. And so, yes, we've looked at a bunch of those over time. And we will continue to do that. The net result has been while we've looked at a bunch of them, we haven't done any. And again, I would say I would condition everybody to say, we like what we got. We think we got the no offense to our competitors. Maybe we had the best set up for the future in the industry. And the last thing we want to do is botch it by either bringing brands that like my father used to say, you hang with the dogs, you get the fleas. We don't want to bring stuff. We don't want to bring stuff in that, that messes up the portfolio and we're intensely focused on good capital allocation. I was \u2013 that those are my origins in business being a good capital allocator. And so when you put it together, I think not high likelihood, but never \u2013 not never impossible. Its too early. I think when we get into the second half of this year, that my own belief, I should hardly say this, but it's like I said to our team the other day do not give away space in 2022 too cheap, like because I think there's going to be gargantuan demand. And as a result, more pricing power than people think, just because you people have accumulated all sorts of needs that are going to get released and it takes time to plan. So what you're going to see in the second half of this year is I think the big uptake will be in the SMERF business, because those are smaller groups they can have the planning is not as time consuming, the lead times are. The big stuff, it takes time when you're doing a thousand person or multi-thousand person conventions. Even if you're doing its hybrid, it takes a lot of planning. And so that's really almost at this point got to start to fall in the next year or so. Yes. I think if all goes according to plan in the first half of this year with vaccinations and there's a reality that, that people feel like they can start to congregate again being intelligent about it, but do it in a safe way. I think you'll \u2013 in the second half of this year, you'll see a bunch of demand that will dump into next year on stuff that requires planning. Yes. I don't think it would be that low. I think we are definitely, I mean we had 5.1% last year. We delivered a lot more than we thought. This is we look at this year, there's a lot of stuff in production. We think again we have really good momentum on conversions, which is going to help us more this year than last it'll help again, even more so in 2022. And then there's just stuff that's moving through that was under construction or was put under construction. That's going to help us. I think next year, I mean we still \u2013 we put 75,000 rooms under construction last year, and most of that is not going to deliver this year. It's going to deliver into next. And as I said, we're ramping on conversion. So I do think that 2022 could be lower than 2021, but not by the degree that that you're suggesting. I still think that ultimately our goal was to be sort of in that 4% to 5% range in all those years. Yes. Both good questions. So on the first, our published rates, you would say if you average all our brands it's about 5.6% and license fees, we're about 5% right now in terms of effective rate, in terms of where people are in the cycle. I \u2013 we're not going to anytime soon be increasing those rates in an absolute sense, but by definition, every time a contract turns, it goes to the new rate. I think I'm not saying anybody likes it, but that's sort of the standard, the standard within the industry. It's certainly what we've always done and we'll continue to do that. So you'll see that sort of grind up about 10, 15 basis points a year. And then when we get to the other side of this, depending on the economics and ultimate market share and all those things, obviously we can look at what we do with our fee structures, but we're going to sort of keep, we think that they are good where they are and we'll keep our effective rates will keep grinding up as you have natural rollover. On the CapEx side, it's really important. It's a delicate balance. The obvious one, which is you got to keep the portfolio. We have the market share leaders in every one of these categories. Part of that is obviously service, a part of its product. And part of that product is about having fresh product, consistent high quality product. We're very religious about it. We have given a lot of relief. Thankfully, we went into the crisis in a really good position, because we've been unbelievably diligent and disciplined. And our owner community over time has recognized that to get those premiums. They have to keep their assets up. And so we went into the crisis a year ago in a good place, we have the ability we think to give them a bit of grace for a period of time and not have a significant impact with our customer base. But as we get to the other side of this, yes, we're going to have to get back to having that kind of discipline, which is not just in our interest. It's in our owners' interest, if they want to continue to drive results. I suspect that that's going to be next year and not this year. Just in the sense that while I think the second half we're going to be in a very different world, we got to \u2013 we're going to have to let folks get back on their feet. And I think given again, the quality of \u2013 on average of our brands and the upkeep of those the brands and the individual hotels going into this, I think we can do that without it being harmful. Hey Smedes. Yes. The geography is exactly what I think you're following in the question and what you would think, it right now is less in the primary markets and more in the secondary and tertiary, just because of what's been going on in a lot of the big cities and the greater density of population. And reality is, as I said a lot of the uptick that we're seeing into the second half of the year is SMERF business. And the nature of that business lends itself more and more to those geographies. I fully expect as I said when we sort of get a bit of the all clear and people start to think about group in a very different way. And I hope that's in the second half of the year, you'll start to see those patterns normalize. But given that it is more in the SMERF segment it by definition ends up being more disproportionately outside of the big urban centers as compared to normal demand patterns at the moment. Again, thank you guys for joining us today. 2020 will go in the record books for sure. Not the greatest year for our company in our 101-year history or the industry certainly. But as I said in my prepared comments, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish. We think the businesses in a terrific position. We are certainly of the mind and hopeful as I've described in many ways that as we get to spring summer, and certainly in the second half of the year, we're going to be in a very different place. And we'll look forward after the first quarter, which will get us to the early spring to hopefully be able to comment on those positive trends. Thanks, again, and everybody stay well."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today.\n We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K as supplemented by our 10-Q filed on August 6, 2020.\n In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.\n This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our third quarter results. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.\n With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris. \nChristopher Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us today, particularly after what might have been a very late night for many that are on the call.\n Our third quarter results continue to reflect the impact of COVID-19. However, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made over the last several months. Travel demand is gradually picking up around the world, and occupancy is meaningfully up from the lows we saw in April. As a result of these improvements, I'm pleased to say that we were able to welcome back most of our furloughed corporate team members last month. And we've been able to successfully navigate the first phase of reopening our corporate offices.\n We've reached important milestones with the vast majority of our properties around the world now open, development deals continuing to pick up and customers starting to feel more comfortable traveling again. We remain focused on sustaining our recovery and driving better results for our owners.\n Turning to the quarter, RevPAR declined approximately 60% year-over-year with performance in urban full-service hotels remaining particularly challenged due to the lack of meetings and events, negligible international travel and local COVID protocols. System-wide occupancy increased sequentially throughout the quarter with all major regions showing improvement. However, momentum slowed in September with occupancy only slightly better than August levels.\n In the U.S., occupancy increased roughly 5 points month-over-month in both July and August but remained largely steady in September. Over Labor Day weekend, roughly half of our properties achieved occupancy levels of 80% or higher given strong leisure demand. As expected, we saw leisure trends slow post summer, offset by a modest uptick in business transient into the fall.\n Asia Pacific led the recovery driven largely by domestic leisure travel in China, with occupancy levels reaching nearly 70% in August, the highest since December 2019. Performance in China was further boosted by local corporate transient and domestic group. In Europe, positive summer momentum stalled in September given a rise in coronavirus cases and tightening government restrictions, resulting in relatively stable occupancy levels of around 35% in August and September.\n Overall, these trends have generally continued into the fourth quarter with fairly steady occupancy as more hotels reopen and ramp, tempered by continued uncertainty surrounding the virus. With more than 97% of our global hotels open and operating, we estimate the vast majority of those hotels are running at breakeven occupancy levels or better. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect trends to remain relatively steady, resulting in fourth quarter RevPAR declines generally in line with the third quarter.\n On the development side, activity continues to pick up. In the quarter, we signed over 17,000 rooms, boosted by better-than-expected conversions, which increased approximately 50% year-over-year and accounted for roughly 20% of our total signings. Year-to-date, we command an industry-leading share of global conversion signings with more than 9,300 rooms signed, representing 1 in 5 deals. Recent notable signings included the Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach in California and the Conrad Abu Dhabi Etihad Towers. These conversions plus new development projects like the Conrad Rabat Arzana in Morocco will further enhance our global luxury and resort footprints.\n In new development, we continue to see strong interest across our focus service brands, with signings up roughly 32% versus the second quarter. Additionally, we recently celebrated our 500th Hampton signing in China.\n At quarter end, our development pipeline totaled 408,000 rooms, representing an 8% increase versus prior year. Additionally, the high quality of our pipeline with more than half of our rooms under construction gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering solid net unit growth for several years. We opened more than 17,000 rooms in the third quarter and achieved net unit growth of 4.7%.\n Openings in the Americas were up more than 31% year-over-year, driven primarily by conversions. Notable openings in the quarter included the Conrad Punta de Mita in Mexico and the Hilton Beijing Tongzhou in China. Additionally, we were thrilled to open the Motto by Hilton in Washington, D.C. City Center, marking our first hotel under the Motto brand.\n For the full year 2020, we now expect net unit growth to be 4.5% to 5% with continued positive momentum in conversions. Additionally, we look forward to celebrating our 1 millionth room milestone in coming weeks. Since our team came in and implemented the company's transformation 13 years ago, we've doubled our size in rooms and number of brands, driven entirely by organic growth.\n Our commitment to delivering on our customers' evolving needs and preferences is even more important now than ever before and calls for even greater innovation and agility in the current environment. To that end, we were excited to launch WorkSpaces by Hilton, which provides guests a clean, flexible and distraction-free environment for productive remote working. Each of our day use rooms includes a spacious desk, a comfortable ergonomic chair, free WiFi plus the use of all available business and leisure amenities.\n We also announced further enhancements to previous Hilton Honors program modifications that will increase flexibility for our more than 110 million members, including reducing 2021 status qualifications and extending status and points expiration. Decisive actions, relentless determination and unwavering commitment to our core values have helped us successfully navigate what has been a challenging and uncertain environment.\n They have also helped position us well for recovery. We're confident that our business model, coupled with our disciplined strategy, will enable us to further differentiate ourselves in the industry and emerge stronger and more efficient than ever before.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on the third quarter. \nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, as Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR declined 60% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis, with decreases across all chain scales and regions. Occupancy drove the majority of the declines with rate pressure due largely to customer mix, further hampering performance. However, we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter driven by hotel reopenings, loosening travel restrictions in most areas and a pickup in summer leisure demand, particularly in China and the U.S.\n Adjusted EBITDA was $224 million in the third quarter, declining 63% year-over-year. Results reflect the continued reduction in global travel demand due to the pandemic and related temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter.\n Management and franchise fees decreased 53%, driven by RevPAR declines. Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by greater cost control at both the corporate and property levels with corporate G&A expense down approximately 38% year-over-year.\n Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to temporary closures, fixed operating costs and fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Cost control measures mitigated losses across the portfolio. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.06.\n Turning to liquidity. We ended the quarter with total cash and equivalents of nearly $3.5 billion. Our cash burn rate improved in the third quarter given gradual recovery in the macro environment, further helped by continued cost discipline and better-than-expected collections. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our liquidity position and ability to navigate the current environment and recovery. Further details on our third quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.\n This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Chad, can we have our first question, please? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. \nCarlo Santarelli: Guys, just in terms of the pipeline, obviously, you guys talked about kind of 3.5% to 4% was the expectation for this year. You obviously spoke to the high end of that range. Now obviously, looking for more, Chris, you spoke a lot in your prepared remarks about kind of the impact of conversions and that the percentage of conversions, I believe, you said was 20% of the 17,000 rooms signed in the quarter.\n As we move out further into 2021, 2022, et cetera, could you talk a little bit about the role that you're foreseeing for forward conversion means to net unit growth? And maybe potentially also talk about kind of what changed this year. Is it just more construction timing and things kind of getting back, started in terms of hotels that were close to the finish line? Maybe a little bit in advance of when you thought they would? \nChristopher Nassetta: Sure. There's a bunch there, but let me unpack it. I think I can pretty succinctly do that. Yes, starting with this year, our numbers have been moving up over the last 3 or 4 months on net unit growth now to being 4.5% to 5%, and that is exactly what you suggested in the question. That's because things have gotten back under construction more rapidly than we were initially assuming, and that means that we're just delivering more this year than we thought we would, which is a good thing.\n And in conversions, while the bulk of that benefit is going to be seen, I think, in '21 and '22, just because of the lag effect, we are seeing more conversions in the year for the year than we had been anticipating, which was reflected in signings being up in the third quarter by 50%. So the flow-through of that is how we're getting to the 4.5% to 5%.\n I think as you think about conversions going forward, last year, it was -- and I'll do this directionally because it's very early, and obviously, we're not giving specific guidance. But directionally, last year, we were in the high teens in terms of the percentage of our NUG that was in conversions. This year, we obviously will see an uptick, 400 or 500 basis points on that. Again, recognizing that there's a lag, even though these happen a lot faster than new builds, there is time to renovate properties in many cases, get them into our systems and the like.\n So we'll be -- if we're in the teens, we'll be in the low to mid-20s. And I think that number will keep creeping up. I've said many times over the years, in the last -- in the Great Recession, I think we peaked out close to 40%. I don't think we will get that high, even though in this world, we have more brands to play with in the sense that then we really had one in DoubleTree. Now we have DoubleTree and 3 soft brands. We're bigger. We have a broader development story than we did from a global point of view in those days.\n And so I do think it will grow from low to mid-20s beyond that in '21 and '22. And you sort of asked it, and I know it's on everybody's mind. And so while I'm on development and NUG, I'll finish the story is we -- it's very early, and I wouldn't take this as like hard guidance, but I would take it like everything else in COVID world as a good direction, and we've done a lot of work around it.\n As we think about NUG and as we've talked about, certainly, in the last call, over the next few years, we think it's probably best we can tell in the 4% to 5% range. We're going to be a little bit obviously better than that this year. Next year, we have a bunch of stuff that will deliver that's been in motion, conversions. But we feel comfortable in that range because even though we will have a drop off, obviously and naturally as a result of fewer things getting put under construction because of the financing markets right now, we still have a lot that already is in production and coming through. And we will supplement that with conversions, which, by definition, effectively have already been financed.\n So I think that's the way I would think about this year. That's the way I think about the next few years that we're sort of somewhere in that 4 to 5 zone, trying to be more precise than that at this point, I think, would be difficult. But we'll obviously keep you updated as time goes on. \nCarlo Santarelli: And Chris, if I could, just a quick follow-up on your response there. That 4% to 5% range, is there an air pocket anywhere in there as you think about kind of maybe the financing [ glob ] that could potentially kind of impact the 2022 or 2023, whatever may be in the lead time? Or do you think that's pretty consistent and steady? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. And Carlo, I -- it depends on how much success we have in filling what will be a decline in newbuilds with conversions. And it's just -- looking that far out is hard to do. That's why I would just direct you to, at the moment, the 4% to 5%. And I think best that we can model it, and that's all it is for us. But it's based on a lot of experience and the trajectory we see and what's already in the pipeline and what's already under construction and what we see in activity and conversions.\n We think the next few years will be within those boundaries. It doesn't mean it will be in the middle every year. It could bounce up and down a little bit based on our projections. But that's about as precise as we could be in the moment. \nOperator: The next question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. \nJoseph Greff: Chris, Kevin, you did a commendable job and have been doing a commendable job on controlling G&A costs. And I know you have some of the furlough impacts in the G&A line and not replicating themselves going forward.\n And not so much for the fourth quarter, but just maybe over the next couple of years, maybe you can just talk about big picture how do you think, in a RevPAR and fee recovery scenario, how you bring back incremental G&A expenses. What is that relationship?  So I don't know if you want to think of it this way. In other words, if we think about 2022 with -- you're at 80%, 85%, 90%, whatever that number is, '22 RevPAR as a percentage of 2019, what is that relationship-wise for G&A, looking back at 2019 as a baseline? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I think, look, obviously, it's a very fair question, and I think you've identified some of the offsetting things, right? I mean I think if you think about -- I know you didn't ask about the fourth quarter. But if you think about the fourth quarter, it's a similar dynamic for '21 and '22, right, where you sort of lose the benefit of the furloughs that we had over the course of the second and third quarter. But you gain the run rate benefit of the reductions in force that we've had and some of the other cost control measures that we've put in place.\n So I'd say, look, I mean, sort of similar answer to NUG, it's a little bit early to be giving you a refined look at 2021 and certainly 2022. But the way we're thinking about it is that most of these savings should be semi-permanent, meaning there will be a point at which the business grows to the point a few years from now where you have to start adding back. But for the foreseeable future, most of the savings should be semi-permanent. And we ought to grow plus or minus inflation over the next couple of years, and that's probably as much guidance as we're comfortable giving you at this point. \nOperator: The next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nShaun Kelley: So Kevin, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about just sort of where we are with the cash burn piece. And I was just wondering, can you just kind of lay out for us directly or clearly, is the corporate entity sort of on a run rate or a monthly basis? Or are you guys at cash burn neutral or even positive at this point? Or what does it take to get there?\n And then maybe as the follow-up, just straight up, it would be how are kind of the broader working capital and franchisee collections going? How is that relationship with franchisees playing out? And how would you characterize some of the risk around any collection at this point? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Shaun. Look, I think the -- I'll take the second part first. I think the answers are obviously pretty very related. The relationship we have with our owners, I'd describe as really positive, I mean, just to put that framework out there. I think everybody is doing the best they can. And I think people, to the extent that they can pay us, are paying us.\n And obviously, you saw over the third quarter with a burn of plus or minus $100 million. That was sort of, I think, better than most people's expectations, including our own. So, so far, we're having a very good experience on collections. And again, everybody is doing the best they can.\n In terms of going forward, are we at breakeven? I'd say we're getting there. I think all things being equal on collections, and if we have a similar experience over the course of the fourth quarter, I'd say we'll be equal to or maybe slightly better than the third quarter will be the fourth quarter experience, again, if things kind of go the way we think they're going to go or they go the way they've been going.\n We do have a couple of timing items like we have a pretty large interest expense payment that just hit in October and things like that. But again, I think all things being equal, it will be equal to or better than the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And what does it take to get to cash flow positive? We're almost there, probably just a little bit more -- a little bit better demand and a little bit better operating performance then you're there. \nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. \nStephen Grambling: Maybe combining both Carlo and -- Carlo's question earlier. You've had, obviously, really solid net unit growth and solid cost control. If we put these 2 together, what level of RevPAR decline versus 201 would you think you would be back to 2019 EBITDA levels but perhaps taking it one step further to 2019 levels of free cash flow? And what are some of the other puts and takes to think about that might influence that? \nChristopher Nassetta: Thanks for the question. Obviously, it's a little bit difficult to be precise with you in the sense of building the model for you as much as I'd like to. And we do have a model, and if you put those 2 things together, I think that's sort of implied in your question, is you will get to free cash flow and EBITDA levels of '19 before you necessarily get back to demand levels of '19 because you have created a much more efficient cost structure.\n I think that is a reasonable assumption, and that is certainly what our models would show that when we get to the other side, because of what Kevin said and what I said, we will keep growing throughout. We will have more units producing on more normalized levels of demand against a lower cost base. The math is pretty easy. That means we're -- when we get to the other side of this and we're on a more normal time, we're a meaningfully higher-margin business because we have cut a lot of costs and we're going to continue to keep those costs out of the business with some basic inflationary pressures on growth.\n And so I can't give you a number. We're not going to give guidance of any sort, particularly multiple years out. But I think if you do basic math and assume what we've already said publicly, you can pretty easily get there. You can see what we're saying in unit growth. You can make your assumptions on REVPAR. We've given pretty solid guidance on.\n We think our G&A structure is going to be down 25% to 30% this year. My guess is it will be towards the higher end of that when it's all said and done, and then it's just arithmetic after that. So we're not going to finish the arithmetic part of it. We'll let you do it. But I think your baseline, I think what is implied in the question is correct. We will get to EBITDA and free cash flow of '19 before we would get to demand levels of '19 for those reasons. \nStephen Grambling: Right. And I guess one other just quick follow-up is just as we think about working capital or other components of cash flow, whether it's CapEx or otherwise, is there anything there that we should be cognizant of that could be different relative to where you were trending kind of pre COVID? \nChristopher Nassetta: I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I mean, obviously, on CapEx, we've reduced CapEx numbers in this environment like every -- pretty much everybody on earth, certainly in our industry and most industries. I think as we get back to that, I think there's -- that will normalize and be more like it was, but there'll be efficiencies, I think, we'll garner on that. And I think, again, when you get to a normalized environment, I think the working capital things sort of go back to the way they were. \nOperator: The next question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. \nThomas Allen: So thank you for the color earlier that you kind of expect fourth quarter RevPAR trends to be similar to third quarter. But can you just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing right now by region? Obviously, we can look at third quarter results, but you're seeing increased closures in Europe. I'd be curious to hear how -- if APAC continue to improve or not. And then just related, corporate rate negotiations should be going on right now. Kind of what are you hearing through those conversations? \nChristopher Nassetta: Okay. Great, Thomas. Yes, there's a lot there, too, but let me unpack it and see if I can. I'm not one for being succinct, as you know, but let me try and be. So regionally, it's pretty much what you guys have been writing about and what you've been seeing. The here and now is that notwithstanding what's going on in the U.S., forget the election but resurgence in coronavirus cases. We've seen here sort of steady, steady as she goes, so to speak. We haven't seen any material backward activity in terms of mobility and demand.\n Now depending on what happens, you could, but we have -- we've seen it remain reasonably steady. I'd say Europe and Middle East is going backwards modestly for the reasons that you would expect. And so as we think about the fourth quarter, we've more recently been sort of knocking our numbers and expectations down because of lockdowns. That's sort of obvious.\n If you look at Latin America, I would say, so goes the U.S., sort of Latin America is generally in keeping in terms of trajectory. And then Asia Pacific, really led by China. I think outside of China, Asia Pacific feels a lot like what's going on in the U.S. I hate to make it all one big bucket. But if you put it all together, it sort of does. And then China, as has been well documented, continues to sort of motor along. And we continue to see pickup in travel in all segments.\n And so when you put it all together, Europe is definitely going a bit backwards. Asia continues to move a little bit forward. U.S. is sort of steady, and that's kind of why we get to a fourth quarter that's about where we are. If we look at October numbers, which we don't have final numbers, but that sort of supports it.\n There is risk in it. I'm not going to deny. I mean depending on what goes on here in the U.S. and other parts of the world with the virus, there's risk. It could go back, whereas our best sense of it is at the moment is people are sort of figuring out how to manage their own risk profile. And as a result, they're getting -- there's a lot of data and information out there as long as their countries aren't locking them down. And I think it's unlikely the U.S. will lock down the whole country. There is some level of mobility that I think will likely allow us to maintain this level of sort of operations that we've been seeing for a period of time.\n And then the next step is, like when do you see the next step change? And my own view is I think you see that in the spring. I think we sort of hold our own between here and there. I think that we'll get an election behind us, which will take some of the air out of the balloon regardless of outcome. I believe that you will start to see a lot coming out of the vaccine world particularly, maybe more out of the therapy world.\n But vaccines on multiple -- in multiple cases, that will have some level of effectiveness that will be able to be mass-produced sometime late this year, early next year, you get through the winter season, the flu season. And I think there's a real opportunity for a step change in attitude and as a result, a step change in performance.\n As we look at our segments, they're sort of reflective of that. Not necessarily they all agree with me, but it's sort of -- that's what you see going on. Leisure is sort of coming off the summer season. On the last call, we said we thought leisure would be stronger into the fall than normally just because people aren't open -- offices aren't open. In a lot of cases, kids aren't back at school, so people have more mobility for leisure purposes. That's exactly what's happened.\n We've seen continued strength, not as much at the summer, but continued strength. We've definitely seen a pickup in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of business travel. It's not the traditional customer en masse that we would typically be housing, but business travel is picking up.\n And group, there is group. I mean in the third quarter, we did about 10% group, which is probably about half of what we've normally done. The groups are different. They're more related to the crisis, sports teams, things like that, but there is some group. But the big return of the group, I think, doesn't really occur until -- hopefully, you get to that moment that I talked about next spring, where we're sort of shifting into a different gear in terms of the health crisis and vaccines.\n As it relates to the last question, I think, I unpacked it all, corp rate negotiations. We've actually done really well. I mean I think the biggest issue on corporate rate negotiations is really how many people are going to show up. Less to me about the rate, although obviously, rates are important, but like, how many people are going to show up under those programs next year? Premature to say. I think it will follow the trends broadly, macro trends that I just described that I think give at least -- or what I believe.\n In terms of rate negotiations, we've had great success. Everybody knows it's a really difficult time. We're now through the majority of those negotiations. And in the majority of cases, our customers have agreed to keep the 2020 rate structure. Not in every case, but in the majority of the cases, they've agreed to do that, recognizing the difficulties of the times. And so we feel actually pretty good about that. Hopefully, that answers your questions plus a little color. \nOperator: And the next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. \nDavid Katz: Good to hear you're all well. You have largely addressed the 2 major buckets that I wanted to ask you about, but I'd like to just take the prior question a little bit further. How much thinking have you sort of put into flexible strategies around what ifs, if the timings on therapeutics and so forth or the effectiveness of distribution, et cetera? And I mean, specifically around the buckets of demand, which have included a majority from business versus leisure and how you sort of fill up your buckets should you have to as things move forward. \nChristopher Nassetta: That's a great question and one we talk about around the table I'm sitting at every Monday morning when we have our executive committee meeting. I mean the reality is, as you might guess, David, while that is -- I gave you a view of what I think, and I think most of our team thinks will be the -- sort of the contour of the recovery from this point forward. We're not counting on that. That is what we think, that is what we hope. Time will tell. I mean as my father used to say, \"Son, fish where the fish are.\" And right now, the fish are where they are, which is certain -- a lot of leisure, frankly, not the typical leisure customers, the lower-rated leisure still. And business travel is a different type of business, smaller business, sales forces, frontline folks responding to the crisis.\n The group business, again, isn't the traditional group, but there are groups out there that are having to meet. We're housing a lot of -- nobody's back -- a lot of people aren't back in offices, so they need to have places to congregate, to have meetings since they're not in their office. You heard me talk about WorkSpaces by Hilton, using rooms as workspaces, particularly for people that need to get out of the house and need WiFi and need some space and privacy.\n And so I could keep going. All our marketing campaigns have shifted, as you've seen, if you've been watching that. All our efforts with Honors have shifted and pivoted. So we're quite mindful of what is going on, where the fish are, to use my metaphor, and intensely focused with our commercial teams on delivering and getting more than our fair share, which I'm happy to say we are. If I look at our relative results in this environment, we're doing very well vis-\u00e0-vis share, so we will continue doing that.\n But then the trick is, this isn't going to last forever. And so it's not like this will be our new strategy forever. It's great. We're honing some new skills that we didn't need to have. And when we get to the other side of this and we get back a more normal demand environment, we won't have -- let those muscles atrophy. But now we'll have other skills -- other tools in our toolkit, and pricing is all about generating a lot of demand. The more demand you can generate, the higher the price you can charge.\n And so as we think about it, it's sort of like really dig in and refine this toolkit. And as we get back to more normal times, take the best of both worlds to put more demand in the funnel to ultimately, intermediate and longer term, be able to price accordingly.\n We're super crazy focused. And think about it, we have -- we're a fiduciary for thousands of owners that are in the most difficult circumstances in their careers because this is the worst thing our industry has seen. And our job is to make sure that we're helping them build the bridge to the other side of this. And so it's one foot in the here and now, one foot in the future, but both solidly planted. \nOperator: And our next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. \nRobin Farley: I wanted to go back to the topic of unit growth because I know you mentioned conversions were 20% of total signings in the quarter. I'm just wondering what percent of openings they were in the quarter just given the increase in your unit growth since last quarter. I'm wondering if that's conversion's driving... \nChristopher Nassetta: They were about 20% in the quarter. And they'll be, as I think I already suggested in a prior comment, a bit more that for the full year. But we do expect that, that -- those percentages will creep up in '21 and '22. \nRobin Farley: So the increase in your unit growth for this year from just a quarter ago sequentially, is that more just construction projects getting back on track faster? I didn't know that, that was... \nChristopher Nassetta: It's both. It's both. We're doing more. I mean while most of the benefit of conversions is going to happen in '21 and '22, we're getting some deals done that the world is opening up fast enough where we're going to open a bunch of incremental conversion hotels in the year for the year that we didn't think we'd open. Plus, yes, now I'd say the vast majority of things that were under construction, 90-plus percent of what was under construction when we went into the crisis is back under construction. And they're making really good progress.\n So we assume sort of a lag effect that when things got up and going, it would take a while for things to wind back up. But honestly, the construction trades around the world, particularly here in the U.S., were ready to go, and they've been worked -- ready to work. And so activity picks up a lot faster. So we're just -- those 2 reasons are why we're delivering more this year. \nRobin Farley: And then just when we think about maybe some that did get pushed into next year just from your kind of pre-COVID original guidance, it sounded like your guidance for next year is in that kind of 4% to 5% range. Are there some things that were originally in next year's openings that just have kind of fallen off that didn't end up going forward? \nChristopher Nassetta: Not much, no. I don't think much changed. A little bit more will open this year, which would have probably -- we would have assumed would have pushed into next year. So that pulls a little bit of that out of next year into this year. But we still feel -- as I said, it's not being evasive. It's just really early to be hyper precise. I mean we can -- at this point, we're deep enough in the year that 4.5% to 5%, we can be pretty precise because some stuff might fall in or out. But over the next few years, that's what I said, we think we're in the 4% to 5% range, and we're not -- you'll have to give us some time to ultimately get a little bit closer to be more precise. \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Robin, I'd just add a little bit to that. I mean I think the way you're thinking about it logically makes perfect sense. I think, though, you got to think about when we first said, half or a little bit better. We were at the very beginning of the crisis in the depths of it. And construction -- and a lot of construction, as Chris said, had been suspended, and we really didn't know when it was going to come back online. So we're just -- we're further into it. We've had a better experience with construction getting back up and running than we thought. And I wouldn't sort of overthink the way it affects the future years. \nOperator: The next question will come from Bill Crow with Raymond James. \nWilliam Crow: Chris, given the positive comments from Kevin on the cash burn nearing 0 and your discussion of cost cuts and margins going forward, I'm just wondering how much confidence level you could provide that you might return to share repurchases as we look forward to 2021? \nChristopher Nassetta: I think that's a really good question. I think it's a little bit premature. We have not changed long term our philosophy on return of capital. And that is -- we believe, when we're back in a more normalized environment, that we're going to produce gargantuan amounts of free cash flow. We don't need a lot of that to grow because we've got the best brands in the business, and we think we can continue to grow organically. Thus, that capital is best given back to our shareholders, largely in the form of buybacks.\n Our philosophy hasn't changed. It's a little bit premature to say exactly when we get back on that program. Obviously, our leverage levels have gone up as a result. If you look at our net debt, it actually won't have gone up year-over-year. But our  EBITDA, as you guys can calculate in your models, even though we haven't given you guidance, has gone way down. So we're going to want to see our debt-to-EBITDA levels come down before we start back up with a share repurchase program.\n That doesn't mean, by the way, that it has to come necessarily all the way back down to the ranges that we've historically said. But we'd want to see that we are solidly 2 feet in the ground in the next stages of recovery and that our debt-to-EBITDA levels are headed towards a more normalized level.\n And given where we are now, which isn't feeling really good about where we are and great about our liquidity and thinking the spring is going to be when we shift gears, I think all of those things, I said all these things, that we have to -- we want to see those things happen. So I think it's a fabulous question. I know people want to know. Hopefully, that gives you some context how we think about it. But we're not in a position at this moment to say when exactly that will be. \nOperator: And the next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. \nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you, you noted about 97% of the rooms are open. So I realize it's a small percentage of the room base that's closed. But is that skewing -- that chunk of like 25,000 to 30,000 rooms, is that skewing towards the owned and leased portfolio? Or is it more across the board? And do you see any of those maybe not reopening? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I think the vast majority will open, to answer the last one first. There may be a few here and there that don't. But I think it skews very heavily to urban destinations in the U.S. and then Europe. That's what it skews very heavily towards. I mean, obviously, with Europe going backwards, we still had more to open in Europe, and now they've gone back and locked down. So our progress there slowed. We may have some hotels go back into suspension in Europe. And then in the U.S., it's almost entirely big urban hotels -- the big urban markets that are suffering the most. \nSmedes Rose: So does that would -- so I guess then it would skew also to kind of the owned and leased portfolio, which I know is small, but it just... \nChristopher Nassetta: Well, no. As we -- we don't -- actually, all of our owned and leased hotels are open at the moment. Now we do have some hotels that are in some of the parts of the world that are going back on lockdown... \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, we did... \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, in Europe and the U.K. But -- so we could have some that go back. But at the moment, all of our owned and leased hotels are open. \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, it skews. It skews heavily towards the management franchise, almost -- well, I would say very heavily towards managed and to a lesser degree, franchised. \nOperator: The next question is from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. \nRichard Clarke: I just want to ask a question on loyalty. How much has loyalty been a boost to your cash flow through the last couple of quarters? Are you still getting money from the credit cards? And I suppose as the follow-up to that, you'll probably come out of this crisis with a bigger loyalty liability than you normally would have. And how do you think about managing that with regard to cash flow over the next couple of years? And how does that feed into your thoughts about what the balance sheet should look like? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Rich, I'd say generally, I don't think we will come out of this with a materially higher liability than we have. If you think about the -- it's a complicated equation of what we take in and what we put on the balance sheet in terms of the liability. But it all -- it does self-regulate in the sense that when rates are lower, the cost of redemptions is lower, the folio charges are lower.\n And we run the whole thing generally breakeven. And so it's not a material contributor either way to our cash flow. There is a portion of the credit card remuneration that is ours. As you can imagine, credit card spend is down. So those -- that remuneration is down, although not nearly as much as RevPAR. So it's not a big swing one way or the other. \nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist. \nCharles Scholes: I wonder if you could comment about what you're observing for group booking and cancellation trends for both 1Q and 2Q of next year? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Well, it's probably not going to shock you. I mean we are a booking business, by the way, in the year for the year still and not in significant amounts. But as I said earlier, it's for unique types of group meetings, smaller corporate meetings in lieu of people being in the office, sports-related group and groups related to recovery efforts and crisis-related efforts.\n As you look at more traditional group bookings or rebookings, because obviously, our objective is to try and rebook everything evenly possible that is getting canceled this year. And we've done, I think, a very good job of doing that. I would say at this point, while we're booking a lot of -- booking and rebooking increasingly significant business into next year, I would say very little of it is into Q1. Some of it is into Q2, and the bulk of it is into Qs 3 and 4.\n And that's for the reasons -- it's sort of been implied in most of what I've said. I think everybody is sort of like on hold for the winter season. Let's get through the flu season, let's get these vaccines sorted out through Phase III and see if we can't start putting shots in people's arms.\n And so if you're planning a big group meeting, you just -- at this point that you're in November, you're not doing it in the first quarter. You're a little hesitant on second quarter, although some of that's happening. But the bulk of what we're booking, which is picking up at a pretty good velocity is in the second half of next year and beyond. \nOperator: The next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. \nAnthony Powell: You mentioned that you saw interest in your select service brands. Could you maybe sell from [ whom or they're from ] new developers, different types of owners? And given kind of the relative resilience of that segment, the cycle, could that lead to more interest in those brands going forward and a higher share for you in the development pipeline at a peak in the next cycle? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I think it's -- commonsensically, the reason we're seeing it is because I do believe we have a lot of owners that are still very, very strong. I think they're of the mind that if you're going to build, the best time to build is during down cycles so that you deliver things into an up cycle. I think many of them fall into our sort of select service development community.\n And they're looking at this as an opportunity to maybe pick better sites with the best brands and sort of lock their position and then go out and see if they can get it financed and get it going with the belief that they'll deliver into a significant upswing. And so I would say there's certainly some -- I mean I'd just let -- Kevin answered it. There's certainly some new owners. But I'd say it's really our -- almost all of it, my sense is, anecdotally, is from our existing owner base.\n The other thing is, this is the stuff that can get done, right? I mean, by the way, this was the trend pre COVID. The bulk of -- if you look at the U.S., particularly, the bulk of what was getting done in the U.S. was all in the limited service space. That was true then. It's even more true now just in terms of the economic model behind it, the margins that they can run, cost to build and all that fun stuff.\n So I think it's -- I don't think it's a particularly new thing. I think our brands are really, really strong. They deliver incredible share. I think people want to take advantage of the crisis to position themselves with the best opportunities for when they get to the other side. \nKevin Jacobs: Yes. And probably just worth adding, Anthony, we did mention that in the prepared remarks. That was quarter-over-quarter growth, I think, in signings in focused service. I'd say, broadly speaking, the skew between existing owners and new owners, probably a little bit more existing because I just think you have to be pretty well healed in the development world to get something done at this point.\n But worth noting that our -- both our approvals and signings over the course of the third quarter were about 1/3 full service, 2/3 limited select service or focused service and pretty well distributed geographically. And that's all pretty consistent with prior -- what we -- our experience in prior quarters and prior years. So not a lot new there. \nOperator: The next question is from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. \nJared Shojaian: Can you just talk about how occupancy trends have evolved in China? Specifically, where is business travel versus leisure travel today versus the prior peak? And then just one unrelated clarification. When you say G&A down 25% to 30%, does that mean the entire year in 2020 is down 25% to 30%? Or should we assume fourth quarter is also down 25% to 30%, and that's the run rate level going forward? \nChristopher Nassetta: That is the full year 2020, and I'll let Kevin talk about China. \nKevin Jacobs: Yes. In China, for -- during the third quarter, China was about 50% leisure, 30% corporate, 20% group. So that was a little bit less leisure and a touch more group than in prior quarters. I actually don't have in front of me where it was to prior peak. I suspect still skewed more towards leisure than it would have been on a normalized basis. \nOperator: And the next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. \nVince Ciepiel: I wanted to touch a bit on distribution. Could you talk about what you've seen over the last couple of quarters in terms of direct business versus OTA share? And if coming through this pandemic, as you evaluate the distribution going into next year or years into the future on a recovery of demand, you've made great strides driving more direct business. I'm just curious if this changes that at all or further accelerates the gains you've seen on that path. \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I don't think -- I mean what's interesting is I don't -- long term, I don't think it changes anything. I think if you looked at like our OTA percentages through Q2, they were tracking pretty consistent with where we've been over the last couple of years. Q3, they were up as we would have expected, just given the base of business, which was non-frequent, non-loyal leisure business during the summer that was -- that is more OTA-oriented. So it was up not in any alarming way, but it was up. And we expected it, and we wanted it to be up in the sense that we wanted access to those customers.\n Our attitude on the long term hasn't changed. Our attitude with the OTAs is they've been good partners for certain types of business. We love working with them through the crisis. There's been plenty of pockets of demand that have been helpful to us and our ownership community work with them on. But at the same time, as you point out, we've been on a long-term trajectory.\n And during COVID, similarly, to build more direct relationships, build more loyalty, give customers more reasons through what we're doing with our digital platform, what we're doing with Honors, that value proposition and the like, what we're doing now with CleanStay and cleanliness and hygiene and all of the things that have come out of the COVID crisis to give people more reason to want to come directly to us.\n And so in a more normalized demand environment, I think the things that we've done in the crisis are going to put us in a really good position to continue down the path of building even more direct relationships and even more direct business. In the interim, we're going to obviously do a bit more business with the OTAs because it's the right thing to do.\n In terms of distribution mix, the majority of our distribution comes from direct channels. Almost 3/4 of it comes from direct channels. I mean the thing that's been interesting, there's been some shift outs, which wouldn't surprise you. I mean if you had asked me this a year ago, I would have said, \"Gosh, it's hard to imagine.\" But what's happened is our percentage of direct has stayed about the same. It's just shifted where hotel direct has gone way up, and our -- and digital channels, other channels have gone down, which seems crazy, but it's just the type of business. And people -- literally, we have 2/3 of our businesses booked within 7 days and like 40% of it almost is booked within the day. And so it's a lot of like drive-through business. People pick up the phone and call like the old days. Obviously, that won't be maintained.\n And then the OTA swap-out, so the OTAs have gone up a little bit. But what has gone down is the GDS on the other side. We could argue about GDS sort of effectively being a direct channel the way we think about it, but we don't. But what has happened is the GDS has gone down because the traditional corporate business that comes through that has evaporated to a large extent, and it's been replaced by OTA-type business.\n So ironically, when you net it all out, we're almost in the exact same place. But sort of a funny world for the moment, I have every expectation as we get to more typical demand levels that those things will all go back to more normal -- a more normal trajectory. And I feel very good about what we're doing vis-\u00e0-vis Honors and our customers to keep building direct relationships. \nOperator: The next question will be from Rich Hightower with Evercore. \nRichard Hightower: I was hoping to get you to opine a little bit on short-term rentals. And when you think about the recovery and maybe some share gains in that segment over the course of the summer and through Labor Day, did that surprise you at all? And Chris, you've made comments in the past about how it's not precisely the same customer that Hilton is going after, but would you make that same statement today? \nChristopher Nassetta: Good, a really good question. And it doesn't really change my view in the sense that I won't make you suffer through the whole thing because you guys know us. But I do believe that's fundamentally a different business. We're in the branded business where we take very consistent product, very consistent service delivery, amenities wrapped in with a product, loyalty, we wrap it all together, and we sell it for a premium versus something that satisfies the customers' needs But is not going to have the consistency, the service, the amenities. Could have loyalty, but at the moment, it doesn't really have loyalty and it results -- as a result, more of a value proposition.\n I just think we fundamentally believe we're in the hospitality business and we get the premiums we get because we do something different and that our business is good and that their business is good, right? But they're -- and while they're related, they're -- fundamentally, we're trying to do different things.\n Now I'm not at all surprised. I had every expectation that this would be good for them. Just think about what I said about where the business is coming from. The bulk of the business this summer was value-oriented leisure business. That is like a bull's eye for those platforms. And so that's great for them.\n And if you had an expectation that, that is all the demand that was going to be available, that this was a secular shift, it would be an issue. I do not believe that. I believe that when we wake up in 2 or 3 years and incrementally over those 2 or 3 years, we will get back to a more normalized environment in terms of demand. And that what we do, that people have been willing to pay a big premium for, they will continue as we get through this crisis to want to stay with us and pay us that premium.\n They will also, for certain stay occasions, want to stay with them for a different type of value proposition. So it wasn't surprising to us at all. It makes all the sense in the world just given the -- if you look at the bucket of demand, the biggest bucket of demand that's out there at the moment. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks. \nChristopher Nassetta: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. I hope everybody that didn't get rest get some rest today. We'll see what happens with all of these crazy elections here in the U.S. We appreciate the time. Obviously, a lot going on in the world, a lot going on with the business. We feel, as I said in my comments, really good about the progress.\n I think we're set up, certainly from a liquidity point of view, in a really good place, but I also think in terms of what we've been doing for our ownership community, what we've been doing with our customers, how we've been taking care of our teams, what we've been doing from a cost structure point of view. I do believe in my heart of hearts that when we get to the other side of this, we're a bigger, better, stronger, more efficient higher-margin business.\n And so we'll look forward to continuing to update you on -- as the journey unfolds. Thanks, and have a great day. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, as Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR declined 60% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis, with decreases across all chain scales and regions. Occupancy drove the majority of the declines with rate pressure due largely to customer mix, further hampering performance. However, we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter driven by hotel reopenings, loosening travel restrictions in most areas and a pickup in summer leisure demand, particularly in China and the U.S.\n Adjusted EBITDA was $224 million in the third quarter, declining 63% year-over-year. Results reflect the continued reduction in global travel demand due to the pandemic and related temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter.\n Management and franchise fees decreased 53%, driven by RevPAR declines. Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by greater cost control at both the corporate and property levels with corporate G&A expense down approximately 38% year-over-year.\n Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to temporary closures, fixed operating costs and fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Cost control measures mitigated losses across the portfolio. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.06.\n Turning to liquidity. We ended the quarter with total cash and equivalents of nearly $3.5 billion. Our cash burn rate improved in the third quarter given gradual recovery in the macro environment, further helped by continued cost discipline and better-than-expected collections. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our liquidity position and ability to navigate the current environment and recovery. Further details on our third quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.\n This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Chad, can we have our first question, please? Yes. Sure. Thanks, Shaun. Look, I think the -- I'll take the second part first. I think the answers are obviously pretty very related. The relationship we have with our owners, I'd describe as really positive, I mean, just to put that framework out there. I think everybody is doing the best they can. And I think people, to the extent that they can pay us, are paying us.\n And obviously, you saw over the third quarter with a burn of plus or minus $100 million. That was sort of, I think, better than most people's expectations, including our own. So, so far, we're having a very good experience on collections. And again, everybody is doing the best they can.\n In terms of going forward, are we at breakeven? I'd say we're getting there. I think all things being equal on collections, and if we have a similar experience over the course of the fourth quarter, I'd say we'll be equal to or maybe slightly better than the third quarter will be the fourth quarter experience, again, if things kind of go the way we think they're going to go or they go the way they've been going.\n We do have a couple of timing items like we have a pretty large interest expense payment that just hit in October and things like that. But again, I think all things being equal, it will be equal to or better than the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And what does it take to get to cash flow positive? We're almost there, probably just a little bit more -- a little bit better demand and a little bit better operating performance then you're there. Yes, Robin, I'd just add a little bit to that. I mean I think the way you're thinking about it logically makes perfect sense. I think, though, you got to think about when we first said, half or a little bit better. We were at the very beginning of the crisis in the depths of it. And construction -- and a lot of construction, as Chris said, had been suspended, and we really didn't know when it was going to come back online. So we're just -- we're further into it. We've had a better experience with construction getting back up and running than we thought. And I wouldn't sort of overthink the way it affects the future years. Yes, we did... Yes, it skews. It skews heavily towards the management franchise, almost -- well, I would say very heavily towards managed and to a lesser degree, franchised. Yes. Rich, I'd say generally, I don't think we will come out of this with a materially higher liability than we have. If you think about the -- it's a complicated equation of what we take in and what we put on the balance sheet in terms of the liability. But it all -- it does self-regulate in the sense that when rates are lower, the cost of redemptions is lower, the folio charges are lower.\n And we run the whole thing generally breakeven. And so it's not a material contributor either way to our cash flow. There is a portion of the credit card remuneration that is ours. As you can imagine, credit card spend is down. So those -- that remuneration is down, although not nearly as much as RevPAR. So it's not a big swing one way or the other. Yes. And probably just worth adding, Anthony, we did mention that in the prepared remarks. That was quarter-over-quarter growth, I think, in signings in focused service. I'd say, broadly speaking, the skew between existing owners and new owners, probably a little bit more existing because I just think you have to be pretty well healed in the development world to get something done at this point.\n But worth noting that our -- both our approvals and signings over the course of the third quarter were about 1/3 full service, 2/3 limited select service or focused service and pretty well distributed geographically. And that's all pretty consistent with prior -- what we -- our experience in prior quarters and prior years. So not a lot new there. Yes. In China, for -- during the third quarter, China was about 50% leisure, 30% corporate, 20% group. So that was a little bit less leisure and a touch more group than in prior quarters. I actually don't have in front of me where it was to prior peak. I suspect still skewed more towards leisure than it would have been on a normalized basis."

            "name": "Christopher Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us today, particularly after what might have been a very late night for many that are on the call.\n Our third quarter results continue to reflect the impact of COVID-19. However, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made over the last several months. Travel demand is gradually picking up around the world, and occupancy is meaningfully up from the lows we saw in April. As a result of these improvements, I'm pleased to say that we were able to welcome back most of our furloughed corporate team members last month. And we've been able to successfully navigate the first phase of reopening our corporate offices.\n We've reached important milestones with the vast majority of our properties around the world now open, development deals continuing to pick up and customers starting to feel more comfortable traveling again. We remain focused on sustaining our recovery and driving better results for our owners.\n Turning to the quarter, RevPAR declined approximately 60% year-over-year with performance in urban full-service hotels remaining particularly challenged due to the lack of meetings and events, negligible international travel and local COVID protocols. System-wide occupancy increased sequentially throughout the quarter with all major regions showing improvement. However, momentum slowed in September with occupancy only slightly better than August levels.\n In the U.S., occupancy increased roughly 5 points month-over-month in both July and August but remained largely steady in September. Over Labor Day weekend, roughly half of our properties achieved occupancy levels of 80% or higher given strong leisure demand. As expected, we saw leisure trends slow post summer, offset by a modest uptick in business transient into the fall.\n Asia Pacific led the recovery driven largely by domestic leisure travel in China, with occupancy levels reaching nearly 70% in August, the highest since December 2019. Performance in China was further boosted by local corporate transient and domestic group. In Europe, positive summer momentum stalled in September given a rise in coronavirus cases and tightening government restrictions, resulting in relatively stable occupancy levels of around 35% in August and September.\n Overall, these trends have generally continued into the fourth quarter with fairly steady occupancy as more hotels reopen and ramp, tempered by continued uncertainty surrounding the virus. With more than 97% of our global hotels open and operating, we estimate the vast majority of those hotels are running at breakeven occupancy levels or better. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect trends to remain relatively steady, resulting in fourth quarter RevPAR declines generally in line with the third quarter.\n On the development side, activity continues to pick up. In the quarter, we signed over 17,000 rooms, boosted by better-than-expected conversions, which increased approximately 50% year-over-year and accounted for roughly 20% of our total signings. Year-to-date, we command an industry-leading share of global conversion signings with more than 9,300 rooms signed, representing 1 in 5 deals. Recent notable signings included the Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach in California and the Conrad Abu Dhabi Etihad Towers. These conversions plus new development projects like the Conrad Rabat Arzana in Morocco will further enhance our global luxury and resort footprints.\n In new development, we continue to see strong interest across our focus service brands, with signings up roughly 32% versus the second quarter. Additionally, we recently celebrated our 500th Hampton signing in China.\n At quarter end, our development pipeline totaled 408,000 rooms, representing an 8% increase versus prior year. Additionally, the high quality of our pipeline with more than half of our rooms under construction gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering solid net unit growth for several years. We opened more than 17,000 rooms in the third quarter and achieved net unit growth of 4.7%.\n Openings in the Americas were up more than 31% year-over-year, driven primarily by conversions. Notable openings in the quarter included the Conrad Punta de Mita in Mexico and the Hilton Beijing Tongzhou in China. Additionally, we were thrilled to open the Motto by Hilton in Washington, D.C. City Center, marking our first hotel under the Motto brand.\n For the full year 2020, we now expect net unit growth to be 4.5% to 5% with continued positive momentum in conversions. Additionally, we look forward to celebrating our 1 millionth room milestone in coming weeks. Since our team came in and implemented the company's transformation 13 years ago, we've doubled our size in rooms and number of brands, driven entirely by organic growth.\n Our commitment to delivering on our customers' evolving needs and preferences is even more important now than ever before and calls for even greater innovation and agility in the current environment. To that end, we were excited to launch WorkSpaces by Hilton, which provides guests a clean, flexible and distraction-free environment for productive remote working. Each of our day use rooms includes a spacious desk, a comfortable ergonomic chair, free WiFi plus the use of all available business and leisure amenities.\n We also announced further enhancements to previous Hilton Honors program modifications that will increase flexibility for our more than 110 million members, including reducing 2021 status qualifications and extending status and points expiration. Decisive actions, relentless determination and unwavering commitment to our core values have helped us successfully navigate what has been a challenging and uncertain environment.\n They have also helped position us well for recovery. We're confident that our business model, coupled with our disciplined strategy, will enable us to further differentiate ourselves in the industry and emerge stronger and more efficient than ever before.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on the third quarter. Sure. There's a bunch there, but let me unpack it. I think I can pretty succinctly do that. Yes, starting with this year, our numbers have been moving up over the last 3 or 4 months on net unit growth now to being 4.5% to 5%, and that is exactly what you suggested in the question. That's because things have gotten back under construction more rapidly than we were initially assuming, and that means that we're just delivering more this year than we thought we would, which is a good thing.\n And in conversions, while the bulk of that benefit is going to be seen, I think, in '21 and '22, just because of the lag effect, we are seeing more conversions in the year for the year than we had been anticipating, which was reflected in signings being up in the third quarter by 50%. So the flow-through of that is how we're getting to the 4.5% to 5%.\n I think as you think about conversions going forward, last year, it was -- and I'll do this directionally because it's very early, and obviously, we're not giving specific guidance. But directionally, last year, we were in the high teens in terms of the percentage of our NUG that was in conversions. This year, we obviously will see an uptick, 400 or 500 basis points on that. Again, recognizing that there's a lag, even though these happen a lot faster than new builds, there is time to renovate properties in many cases, get them into our systems and the like.\n So we'll be -- if we're in the teens, we'll be in the low to mid-20s. And I think that number will keep creeping up. I've said many times over the years, in the last -- in the Great Recession, I think we peaked out close to 40%. I don't think we will get that high, even though in this world, we have more brands to play with in the sense that then we really had one in DoubleTree. Now we have DoubleTree and 3 soft brands. We're bigger. We have a broader development story than we did from a global point of view in those days.\n And so I do think it will grow from low to mid-20s beyond that in '21 and '22. And you sort of asked it, and I know it's on everybody's mind. And so while I'm on development and NUG, I'll finish the story is we -- it's very early, and I wouldn't take this as like hard guidance, but I would take it like everything else in COVID world as a good direction, and we've done a lot of work around it.\n As we think about NUG and as we've talked about, certainly, in the last call, over the next few years, we think it's probably best we can tell in the 4% to 5% range. We're going to be a little bit obviously better than that this year. Next year, we have a bunch of stuff that will deliver that's been in motion, conversions. But we feel comfortable in that range because even though we will have a drop off, obviously and naturally as a result of fewer things getting put under construction because of the financing markets right now, we still have a lot that already is in production and coming through. And we will supplement that with conversions, which, by definition, effectively have already been financed.\n So I think that's the way I would think about this year. That's the way I think about the next few years that we're sort of somewhere in that 4 to 5 zone, trying to be more precise than that at this point, I think, would be difficult. But we'll obviously keep you updated as time goes on. Yes. And Carlo, I -- it depends on how much success we have in filling what will be a decline in newbuilds with conversions. And it's just -- looking that far out is hard to do. That's why I would just direct you to, at the moment, the 4% to 5%. And I think best that we can model it, and that's all it is for us. But it's based on a lot of experience and the trajectory we see and what's already in the pipeline and what's already under construction and what we see in activity and conversions.\n We think the next few years will be within those boundaries. It doesn't mean it will be in the middle every year. It could bounce up and down a little bit based on our projections. But that's about as precise as we could be in the moment. Yes. I think, look, obviously, it's a very fair question, and I think you've identified some of the offsetting things, right? I mean I think if you think about -- I know you didn't ask about the fourth quarter. But if you think about the fourth quarter, it's a similar dynamic for '21 and '22, right, where you sort of lose the benefit of the furloughs that we had over the course of the second and third quarter. But you gain the run rate benefit of the reductions in force that we've had and some of the other cost control measures that we've put in place.\n So I'd say, look, I mean, sort of similar answer to NUG, it's a little bit early to be giving you a refined look at 2021 and certainly 2022. But the way we're thinking about it is that most of these savings should be semi-permanent, meaning there will be a point at which the business grows to the point a few years from now where you have to start adding back. But for the foreseeable future, most of the savings should be semi-permanent. And we ought to grow plus or minus inflation over the next couple of years, and that's probably as much guidance as we're comfortable giving you at this point. Thanks for the question. Obviously, it's a little bit difficult to be precise with you in the sense of building the model for you as much as I'd like to. And we do have a model, and if you put those 2 things together, I think that's sort of implied in your question, is you will get to free cash flow and EBITDA levels of '19 before you necessarily get back to demand levels of '19 because you have created a much more efficient cost structure.\n I think that is a reasonable assumption, and that is certainly what our models would show that when we get to the other side, because of what Kevin said and what I said, we will keep growing throughout. We will have more units producing on more normalized levels of demand against a lower cost base. The math is pretty easy. That means we're -- when we get to the other side of this and we're on a more normal time, we're a meaningfully higher-margin business because we have cut a lot of costs and we're going to continue to keep those costs out of the business with some basic inflationary pressures on growth.\n And so I can't give you a number. We're not going to give guidance of any sort, particularly multiple years out. But I think if you do basic math and assume what we've already said publicly, you can pretty easily get there. You can see what we're saying in unit growth. You can make your assumptions on REVPAR. We've given pretty solid guidance on.\n We think our G&A structure is going to be down 25% to 30% this year. My guess is it will be towards the higher end of that when it's all said and done, and then it's just arithmetic after that. So we're not going to finish the arithmetic part of it. We'll let you do it. But I think your baseline, I think what is implied in the question is correct. We will get to EBITDA and free cash flow of '19 before we would get to demand levels of '19 for those reasons. I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I mean, obviously, on CapEx, we've reduced CapEx numbers in this environment like every -- pretty much everybody on earth, certainly in our industry and most industries. I think as we get back to that, I think there's -- that will normalize and be more like it was, but there'll be efficiencies, I think, we'll garner on that. And I think, again, when you get to a normalized environment, I think the working capital things sort of go back to the way they were. Okay. Great, Thomas. Yes, there's a lot there, too, but let me unpack it and see if I can. I'm not one for being succinct, as you know, but let me try and be. So regionally, it's pretty much what you guys have been writing about and what you've been seeing. The here and now is that notwithstanding what's going on in the U.S., forget the election but resurgence in coronavirus cases. We've seen here sort of steady, steady as she goes, so to speak. We haven't seen any material backward activity in terms of mobility and demand.\n Now depending on what happens, you could, but we have -- we've seen it remain reasonably steady. I'd say Europe and Middle East is going backwards modestly for the reasons that you would expect. And so as we think about the fourth quarter, we've more recently been sort of knocking our numbers and expectations down because of lockdowns. That's sort of obvious.\n If you look at Latin America, I would say, so goes the U.S., sort of Latin America is generally in keeping in terms of trajectory. And then Asia Pacific, really led by China. I think outside of China, Asia Pacific feels a lot like what's going on in the U.S. I hate to make it all one big bucket. But if you put it all together, it sort of does. And then China, as has been well documented, continues to sort of motor along. And we continue to see pickup in travel in all segments.\n And so when you put it all together, Europe is definitely going a bit backwards. Asia continues to move a little bit forward. U.S. is sort of steady, and that's kind of why we get to a fourth quarter that's about where we are. If we look at October numbers, which we don't have final numbers, but that sort of supports it.\n There is risk in it. I'm not going to deny. I mean depending on what goes on here in the U.S. and other parts of the world with the virus, there's risk. It could go back, whereas our best sense of it is at the moment is people are sort of figuring out how to manage their own risk profile. And as a result, they're getting -- there's a lot of data and information out there as long as their countries aren't locking them down. And I think it's unlikely the U.S. will lock down the whole country. There is some level of mobility that I think will likely allow us to maintain this level of sort of operations that we've been seeing for a period of time.\n And then the next step is, like when do you see the next step change? And my own view is I think you see that in the spring. I think we sort of hold our own between here and there. I think that we'll get an election behind us, which will take some of the air out of the balloon regardless of outcome. I believe that you will start to see a lot coming out of the vaccine world particularly, maybe more out of the therapy world.\n But vaccines on multiple -- in multiple cases, that will have some level of effectiveness that will be able to be mass-produced sometime late this year, early next year, you get through the winter season, the flu season. And I think there's a real opportunity for a step change in attitude and as a result, a step change in performance.\n As we look at our segments, they're sort of reflective of that. Not necessarily they all agree with me, but it's sort of -- that's what you see going on. Leisure is sort of coming off the summer season. On the last call, we said we thought leisure would be stronger into the fall than normally just because people aren't open -- offices aren't open. In a lot of cases, kids aren't back at school, so people have more mobility for leisure purposes. That's exactly what's happened.\n We've seen continued strength, not as much at the summer, but continued strength. We've definitely seen a pickup in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of business travel. It's not the traditional customer en masse that we would typically be housing, but business travel is picking up.\n And group, there is group. I mean in the third quarter, we did about 10% group, which is probably about half of what we've normally done. The groups are different. They're more related to the crisis, sports teams, things like that, but there is some group. But the big return of the group, I think, doesn't really occur until -- hopefully, you get to that moment that I talked about next spring, where we're sort of shifting into a different gear in terms of the health crisis and vaccines.\n As it relates to the last question, I think, I unpacked it all, corp rate negotiations. We've actually done really well. I mean I think the biggest issue on corporate rate negotiations is really how many people are going to show up. Less to me about the rate, although obviously, rates are important, but like, how many people are going to show up under those programs next year? Premature to say. I think it will follow the trends broadly, macro trends that I just described that I think give at least -- or what I believe.\n In terms of rate negotiations, we've had great success. Everybody knows it's a really difficult time. We're now through the majority of those negotiations. And in the majority of cases, our customers have agreed to keep the 2020 rate structure. Not in every case, but in the majority of the cases, they've agreed to do that, recognizing the difficulties of the times. And so we feel actually pretty good about that. Hopefully, that answers your questions plus a little color. That's a great question and one we talk about around the table I'm sitting at every Monday morning when we have our executive committee meeting. I mean the reality is, as you might guess, David, while that is -- I gave you a view of what I think, and I think most of our team thinks will be the -- sort of the contour of the recovery from this point forward. We're not counting on that. That is what we think, that is what we hope. Time will tell. I mean as my father used to say, \"Son, fish where the fish are.\" And right now, the fish are where they are, which is certain -- a lot of leisure, frankly, not the typical leisure customers, the lower-rated leisure still. And business travel is a different type of business, smaller business, sales forces, frontline folks responding to the crisis.\n The group business, again, isn't the traditional group, but there are groups out there that are having to meet. We're housing a lot of -- nobody's back -- a lot of people aren't back in offices, so they need to have places to congregate, to have meetings since they're not in their office. You heard me talk about WorkSpaces by Hilton, using rooms as workspaces, particularly for people that need to get out of the house and need WiFi and need some space and privacy.\n And so I could keep going. All our marketing campaigns have shifted, as you've seen, if you've been watching that. All our efforts with Honors have shifted and pivoted. So we're quite mindful of what is going on, where the fish are, to use my metaphor, and intensely focused with our commercial teams on delivering and getting more than our fair share, which I'm happy to say we are. If I look at our relative results in this environment, we're doing very well vis-a\u0300-vis share, so we will continue doing that.\n But then the trick is, this isn't going to last forever. And so it's not like this will be our new strategy forever. It's great. We're honing some new skills that we didn't need to have. And when we get to the other side of this and we get back a more normal demand environment, we won't have -- let those muscles atrophy. But now we'll have other skills -- other tools in our toolkit, and pricing is all about generating a lot of demand. The more demand you can generate, the higher the price you can charge.\n And so as we think about it, it's sort of like really dig in and refine this toolkit. And as we get back to more normal times, take the best of both worlds to put more demand in the funnel to ultimately, intermediate and longer term, be able to price accordingly.\n We're super crazy focused. And think about it, we have -- we're a fiduciary for thousands of owners that are in the most difficult circumstances in their careers because this is the worst thing our industry has seen. And our job is to make sure that we're helping them build the bridge to the other side of this. And so it's one foot in the here and now, one foot in the future, but both solidly planted. They were about 20% in the quarter. And they'll be, as I think I already suggested in a prior comment, a bit more that for the full year. But we do expect that, that -- those percentages will creep up in '21 and '22. It's both. It's both. We're doing more. I mean while most of the benefit of conversions is going to happen in '21 and '22, we're getting some deals done that the world is opening up fast enough where we're going to open a bunch of incremental conversion hotels in the year for the year that we didn't think we'd open. Plus, yes, now I'd say the vast majority of things that were under construction, 90-plus percent of what was under construction when we went into the crisis is back under construction. And they're making really good progress.\n So we assume sort of a lag effect that when things got up and going, it would take a while for things to wind back up. But honestly, the construction trades around the world, particularly here in the U.S., were ready to go, and they've been worked -- ready to work. And so activity picks up a lot faster. So we're just -- those 2 reasons are why we're delivering more this year. Not much, no. I don't think much changed. A little bit more will open this year, which would have probably -- we would have assumed would have pushed into next year. So that pulls a little bit of that out of next year into this year. But we still feel -- as I said, it's not being evasive. It's just really early to be hyper precise. I mean we can -- at this point, we're deep enough in the year that 4.5% to 5%, we can be pretty precise because some stuff might fall in or out. But over the next few years, that's what I said, we think we're in the 4% to 5% range, and we're not -- you'll have to give us some time to ultimately get a little bit closer to be more precise. I think that's a really good question. I think it's a little bit premature. We have not changed long term our philosophy on return of capital. And that is -- we believe, when we're back in a more normalized environment, that we're going to produce gargantuan amounts of free cash flow. We don't need a lot of that to grow because we've got the best brands in the business, and we think we can continue to grow organically. Thus, that capital is best given back to our shareholders, largely in the form of buybacks.\n Our philosophy hasn't changed. It's a little bit premature to say exactly when we get back on that program. Obviously, our leverage levels have gone up as a result. If you look at our net debt, it actually won't have gone up year-over-year. But our  EBITDA, as you guys can calculate in your models, even though we haven't given you guidance, has gone way down. So we're going to want to see our debt-to-EBITDA levels come down before we start back up with a share repurchase program.\n That doesn't mean, by the way, that it has to come necessarily all the way back down to the ranges that we've historically said. But we'd want to see that we are solidly 2 feet in the ground in the next stages of recovery and that our debt-to-EBITDA levels are headed towards a more normalized level.\n And given where we are now, which isn't feeling really good about where we are and great about our liquidity and thinking the spring is going to be when we shift gears, I think all of those things, I said all these things, that we have to -- we want to see those things happen. So I think it's a fabulous question. I know people want to know. Hopefully, that gives you some context how we think about it. But we're not in a position at this moment to say when exactly that will be. Yes. I think the vast majority will open, to answer the last one first. There may be a few here and there that don't. But I think it skews very heavily to urban destinations in the U.S. and then Europe. That's what it skews very heavily towards. I mean, obviously, with Europe going backwards, we still had more to open in Europe, and now they've gone back and locked down. So our progress there slowed. We may have some hotels go back into suspension in Europe. And then in the U.S., it's almost entirely big urban hotels -- the big urban markets that are suffering the most. Well, no. As we -- we don't -- actually, all of our owned and leased hotels are open at the moment. Now we do have some hotels that are in some of the parts of the world that are going back on lockdown... Yes, in Europe and the U.K. But -- so we could have some that go back. But at the moment, all of our owned and leased hotels are open. Yes. Well, it's probably not going to shock you. I mean we are a booking business, by the way, in the year for the year still and not in significant amounts. But as I said earlier, it's for unique types of group meetings, smaller corporate meetings in lieu of people being in the office, sports-related group and groups related to recovery efforts and crisis-related efforts.\n As you look at more traditional group bookings or rebookings, because obviously, our objective is to try and rebook everything evenly possible that is getting canceled this year. And we've done, I think, a very good job of doing that. I would say at this point, while we're booking a lot of -- booking and rebooking increasingly significant business into next year, I would say very little of it is into Q1. Some of it is into Q2, and the bulk of it is into Qs 3 and 4.\n And that's for the reasons -- it's sort of been implied in most of what I've said. I think everybody is sort of like on hold for the winter season. Let's get through the flu season, let's get these vaccines sorted out through Phase III and see if we can't start putting shots in people's arms.\n And so if you're planning a big group meeting, you just -- at this point that you're in November, you're not doing it in the first quarter. You're a little hesitant on second quarter, although some of that's happening. But the bulk of what we're booking, which is picking up at a pretty good velocity is in the second half of next year and beyond. Yes. I think it's -- commonsensically, the reason we're seeing it is because I do believe we have a lot of owners that are still very, very strong. I think they're of the mind that if you're going to build, the best time to build is during down cycles so that you deliver things into an up cycle. I think many of them fall into our sort of select service development community.\n And they're looking at this as an opportunity to maybe pick better sites with the best brands and sort of lock their position and then go out and see if they can get it financed and get it going with the belief that they'll deliver into a significant upswing. And so I would say there's certainly some -- I mean I'd just let -- Kevin answered it. There's certainly some new owners. But I'd say it's really our -- almost all of it, my sense is, anecdotally, is from our existing owner base.\n The other thing is, this is the stuff that can get done, right? I mean, by the way, this was the trend pre COVID. The bulk of -- if you look at the U.S., particularly, the bulk of what was getting done in the U.S. was all in the limited service space. That was true then. It's even more true now just in terms of the economic model behind it, the margins that they can run, cost to build and all that fun stuff.\n So I think it's -- I don't think it's a particularly new thing. I think our brands are really, really strong. They deliver incredible share. I think people want to take advantage of the crisis to position themselves with the best opportunities for when they get to the other side. That is the full year 2020, and I'll let Kevin talk about China. Yes. I don't think -- I mean what's interesting is I don't -- long term, I don't think it changes anything. I think if you looked at like our OTA percentages through Q2, they were tracking pretty consistent with where we've been over the last couple of years. Q3, they were up as we would have expected, just given the base of business, which was non-frequent, non-loyal leisure business during the summer that was -- that is more OTA-oriented. So it was up not in any alarming way, but it was up. And we expected it, and we wanted it to be up in the sense that we wanted access to those customers.\n Our attitude on the long term hasn't changed. Our attitude with the OTAs is they've been good partners for certain types of business. We love working with them through the crisis. There's been plenty of pockets of demand that have been helpful to us and our ownership community work with them on. But at the same time, as you point out, we've been on a long-term trajectory.\n And during COVID, similarly, to build more direct relationships, build more loyalty, give customers more reasons through what we're doing with our digital platform, what we're doing with Honors, that value proposition and the like, what we're doing now with CleanStay and cleanliness and hygiene and all of the things that have come out of the COVID crisis to give people more reason to want to come directly to us.\n And so in a more normalized demand environment, I think the things that we've done in the crisis are going to put us in a really good position to continue down the path of building even more direct relationships and even more direct business. In the interim, we're going to obviously do a bit more business with the OTAs because it's the right thing to do.\n In terms of distribution mix, the majority of our distribution comes from direct channels. Almost 3/4 of it comes from direct channels. I mean the thing that's been interesting, there's been some shift outs, which wouldn't surprise you. I mean if you had asked me this a year ago, I would have said, \"Gosh, it's hard to imagine.\" But what's happened is our percentage of direct has stayed about the same. It's just shifted where hotel direct has gone way up, and our -- and digital channels, other channels have gone down, which seems crazy, but it's just the type of business. And people -- literally, we have 2/3 of our businesses booked within 7 days and like 40% of it almost is booked within the day. And so it's a lot of like drive-through business. People pick up the phone and call like the old days. Obviously, that won't be maintained.\n And then the OTA swap-out, so the OTAs have gone up a little bit. But what has gone down is the GDS on the other side. We could argue about GDS sort of effectively being a direct channel the way we think about it, but we don't. But what has happened is the GDS has gone down because the traditional corporate business that comes through that has evaporated to a large extent, and it's been replaced by OTA-type business.\n So ironically, when you net it all out, we're almost in the exact same place. But sort of a funny world for the moment, I have every expectation as we get to more typical demand levels that those things will all go back to more normal -- a more normal trajectory. And I feel very good about what we're doing vis-a\u0300-vis Honors and our customers to keep building direct relationships. Good, a really good question. And it doesn't really change my view in the sense that I won't make you suffer through the whole thing because you guys know us. But I do believe that's fundamentally a different business. We're in the branded business where we take very consistent product, very consistent service delivery, amenities wrapped in with a product, loyalty, we wrap it all together, and we sell it for a premium versus something that satisfies the customers' needs But is not going to have the consistency, the service, the amenities. Could have loyalty, but at the moment, it doesn't really have loyalty and it results -- as a result, more of a value proposition.\n I just think we fundamentally believe we're in the hospitality business and we get the premiums we get because we do something different and that our business is good and that their business is good, right? But they're -- and while they're related, they're -- fundamentally, we're trying to do different things.\n Now I'm not at all surprised. I had every expectation that this would be good for them. Just think about what I said about where the business is coming from. The bulk of the business this summer was value-oriented leisure business. That is like a bull's eye for those platforms. And so that's great for them.\n And if you had an expectation that, that is all the demand that was going to be available, that this was a secular shift, it would be an issue. I do not believe that. I believe that when we wake up in 2 or 3 years and incrementally over those 2 or 3 years, we will get back to a more normalized environment in terms of demand. And that what we do, that people have been willing to pay a big premium for, they will continue as we get through this crisis to want to stay with us and pay us that premium.\n They will also, for certain stay occasions, want to stay with them for a different type of value proposition. So it wasn't surprising to us at all. It makes all the sense in the world just given the -- if you look at the bucket of demand, the biggest bucket of demand that's out there at the moment. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. I hope everybody that didn't get rest get some rest today. We'll see what happens with all of these crazy elections here in the U.S. We appreciate the time. Obviously, a lot going on in the world, a lot going on with the business. We feel, as I said in my comments, really good about the progress.\n I think we're set up, certainly from a liquidity point of view, in a really good place, but I also think in terms of what we've been doing for our ownership community, what we've been doing with our customers, how we've been taking care of our teams, what we've been doing from a cost structure point of view. I do believe in my heart of hearts that when we get to the other side of this, we're a bigger, better, stronger, more efficient higher-margin business.\n And so we'll look forward to continuing to update you on -- as the journey unfolds. Thanks, and have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K supplemented by our 10-Q filed on May 7, 2020. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today\u2019s call, in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment; Kevin Jacobs, Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our second quarter results. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Before we get started, I would like to offer our sympathies to all those affected by the recent explosion in Beirut, our thoughts are with our team members and everybody impacted by this tragic event. It goes without saying that these past several months have been challenging. While we have continued to navigate the global coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our business and the communities we serve globally. Here in the U.S., we have also witnessed tragic acts of social injustice leading to difficult, but necessary discussions regarding systemic inequalities. For more than a century, our hotels have been a welcoming place for all, a place where we bring together people of all backgrounds and connect them to the light and warmth of our hospitality. Now more than ever, Hilton remains committed to fostering an inclusive culture and driving positive change in our communities and society more broadly. Building on the work we have been doing, we have set even more aggressive leadership diversity targets across our corporate and hotel teams. As we announced yesterday, we are happy to welcome Chris Carr to our board of directors. Chris brings several decades of executive leadership across global consumer companies and we look forward to his insights and diversity of thoughts as we focus on our near-term recovery and long-term growth opportunities. Unfortunately, the new reality of our business required us to adapt our organizational structure moving forward. During the quarter, we took additional measures to further reduce costs, including the reduction of approximately 2,100 corporate roles globally and the extension of previously announced furloughs. These were very difficult decisions as our company\u2019s culture has always been centered on supporting our team members who deliver hospitality for our guests. Through these challenging times, I am proud of how our team has continued to live our Hilton values to have integrity, to deliver exceptional guests experiences, and to be leaders in our industry and in our communities. We are working hard to restore confidence to travel again and have taken a number of measures to enhance the safety of our team members and guests. In June, we launched Hilton Clean Stay in collaboration with Lysol and the Mayo Clinic to provide industry leading hygiene practices in our properties all around the world. Our new elevated standards include modifying housekeeping procedures and adjusting common areas in our hotels to support social distancing. As part of the program, we also recently launched Hilton Event Ready, which sets new standards for cleanliness and customer service for meetings and events. Additionally, we are requiring everyone inside our hotels in the U.S. to wear face coverings in all indoor public spaces. Long before COVID-19, we had invested heavily in technology to give our Hilton Honors members access to seamless and contactless experiences with our Hilton Honors app. Today, our Honors members can benefit from features like digital check-in, room selection and the ability to message with hotel team members from their own device. Additionally, digital key allows for contactless check-in and check-out at the vast majority of our hotels globally. Combined with our new approaches to cleanliness, we think these are important initiatives on the road to reassuring guests of a safe experience at our hotels as travel resumes, while still delivering exceptional customer service. Turning to the quarter, as expected the pandemic and the related decreases in global travel and tourism materially affected our second quarter results. System-wide RevPAR declined 81% year-over-year with all regions and chain scales meaningfully impacted. Approximately, 20% of our system-wide properties had temporarily suspended operations at some point in the first half of the year. Today, nearly 80% of those hotels have reopened, including all of our hotels in China and the majority of our hotels in the United States. In Europe, we are seeing steady progress on re-openings as restrictions ease and demand gradually return. Today, more than 96% of our system-wide hotels are open and operating. In terms of demand, we are seeing meaningful improvements off the lows in April with monthly sequential increases throughout the quarter and into July. System-wide occupancy rebounded from a low of roughly 13% to approximately 45% currently, with all major regions improving. In Asia-Pacific, performance is largely driven by rebounds in both leisure and business transient travel in China, where occupancy is more than 60%. In the Americas, occupancy is over 45% boosted by increasing demand for limited service hotels and drive to leisure markets. During the 4th of July weekend, nearly 800 hotels in the U.S. ran over 80% occupancy. Across Europe, Middle East and Africa, occupancy is generally around 30%, although easing government restrictions and continued reopening should help drive further improvements there. As we look to the fall, assuming no significant disruptions to the current environment, we hope to see a continuation of the modest pickup in business transient demand, which would help offset slower leisure demand post-summer. However, we remain cautious given the uncertainty surrounding the virus and its overall impact, including the reopening of schools and offices. While we continue to adjust to new ways of interacting, one thing remains consistent, our focus on doing what is right for our guests and their evolving travel needs. For that reason, we made a number of changes very early on. We introduced and have since extended the most flexible cancellation policies in the industry and were among the first global hotel companies to implement rewards extensions to help Honors member maintain their points and status. Through our partnership with American Express, we also enhanced our co-branded credit cards to include more ways for Honors members to earn rewards during this time and provide cardholders with greater flexibility and even more points now to use for future travel. From a development perspective, activity was disrupted given the broader macro challenges yet, we were still able to add 7,000 rooms to our system and achieved 4.8% net unit growth versus the same period last year. Monthly openings increased sequentially throughout the quarter and in June, openings in the Americas were nearly 15% higher than last year. Additionally, we continue to be encouraged by conversion opportunities, which should help mitigate the impact of construction delays. For the full year, we expect net unit growth to be in the 3.5% to 4% range. It will take time for development to fully recover, but we are confident that we have the brands and the commercial engines to continue taking a disproportionate share of the global pipeline. In the quarter, we signed several notable luxury deals, including the Waldorf-Astoria Tokyo, the Conrad Costa del Sol in Spain, and the Oceana in Santa Monica which will join our LXR portfolio. On the conversion side, we saw positive momentum across our Doubletree, Curio and Tapestry brands. As an additional testament to the strength of our development strategy, during the quarter, we signed a management license agreement with Country Garden, one of the strongest players in the Chinese property market to exclusively develop Home2 Suites properties in China. We expect this partnership to produce more than 1,000 hotels over time and look forward to introducing a new brand and segment to the Chinese market. As one of Hilton\u2019s fastest growing and award winning brands, we think Home2 is well-positioned to capture additional growth opportunities in the extended stay mid-scale segments in China. Taking the current landscape and uncertainties into considerations, we have a clear path forward. I am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish during these difficult times and I am confident that we will emerge stronger. I think we have demonstrated our flexibility, resiliency and an ability to embrace change, all while continuing to do what\u2019s best for our people and the future of our business. With that, I am going to turn the call over to Kevin for a little bit more detail on the second quarter results.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. In the quarter, as Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR declined 81% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis with decreases across all chain scales and regions. Decreases were largely driven by occupancy declines with rate pressure from increased competition for lower rated business further impacting results. We did however see sequential improvement throughout the quarter, particularly in China and the U.S. Adjusted EBITDA was $51 million in the second quarter, declining 92% year-over-year. Results reflect the significant reduction in global travel demand due to COVID-19 and the subsequent temporary suspension of operations at more than 1,000 hotels at some point in the quarter. Revenue declines were mitigated by greater cost control at the corporate and property levels. Management franchise fees decreased 77% to $135 million driven by RevPAR declines and unfavorable timing of license fees. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to significant closures, fixed operating cost and fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Results were mitigated by cost control tactics across the portfolio. Diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.61. Turning to liquidity, we ended the quarter with total cash and equivalents of nearly $3.6 billion following a number of actions taken early in the quarter to enhance our position and increase our financial flexibility. Additionally, our cash burn during the second quarter was lower than expected partially due to the timing of certain payments. As we look at the balance of the year, we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to navigate the current environment and prepare for recovery. Further details on our second quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, Chris. Kevin. Thank you for your comments.\nChris Nassetta: Hey, good morning, Carlo.\nCarlo Santarelli: Good morning. Chris, you talked a little bit about obviously we have seen demand come off the low as we see that in this data and that you expect kind of a modest type of business transient demand somewhat offset a waning leisure as we move out of the summer vacation month. Bigger picture, as you think about the second half of this year, could you talk a little bit about how you foresee kind of the shape of the recovery in aggregate?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, I\u2019d be happy to. Obviously that is the big question. And I certainly have a view, although I think there is obviously still enough uncertainty out there, where we \u2013 it\u2019s hard to be confident in the view, but my view really hasn\u2019t changed, Carlo, a whole lot from the last call. And if I think about the shape of the recovery so far, which has gone from a low of basically a little over 10% and now running 45% and moving our way up to 50%. That\u2019s \u2013 while those are still terrible numbers, that is a lot of improvement over a relatively short period of time. And if you go back to what I said on the last call, that\u2019s sort of what we had expected. I mean, things are sort of moving fairly close to what we would have expected. I said on the last call and I\u2019d sort of say the same thing, I think we are going \u2013 you are going to see a step change from very, very low levels as you start to reopen the world, where you are going to get to 40% to 50% occupancy levels by the end of the summer, early fall and then it\u2019s going to be a grind up, because as you get through the health elements of this crisis, you are going to be dealing with an economic crisis or a recessionary environment and businesses and individuals have been impacted. And so, you are going to be on a grind up from there. And that\u2019s sort of what I think is happening. I think as you go into the fall, what I would hope is that we are going to be in that 45% to 50% range. You are going to see leisure trail off as you always do, but I think a little less so, it will take a little longer for that to bleed off, because a lot of kids aren\u2019t going back to school or that they are, but virtually a lot of offices aren\u2019t opening up do you know and so their people are going to be virtual. So, they have a lot more flexibility to sort of extend the leisure travel season and we can already see early telltale signs of that, because it\u2019s been very hard to get availability in certain locations in July and August. So, they are extending into September and maybe into October. So, I think you will have a little bit heavier leisure business as you go into the fall, which will be helpful, because that\u2019s been significant part of the business. And you will I think continue to see some movement up in business transient. We saw it through the quarter. I mean, if you look at our managed \u2013 our managed business transient segment, which would typically be like last year in June was 20% of our business. In June of 2020, it was 18% of our business. Now, it\u2019s a little bit different makeup of business traveler than probably it was last year for the last decade or two or three, but nonetheless, it was business-related travel. So, you are starting to see that come back not rapidly, but slowly. And I do think all things being equal as you get into the fall, you will see that continue. So, I think you are going to hopefully crossover with the pickup \u2013 with dropping off of leisure \u2013 a slight pickup in business and you are going to sort of hang out in that arena and be grinding slowly, but surely as we have been our way up even with the recurrence of COVID in a bunch of parts of the country. We stepped back for 2 or 3 weeks if you look at the data and then we started to march back and grind back up again. And that\u2019s \u2013 the grind up again will depend on the trajectory of the overall recovery. I think my own view as I said it last time I think its 2 or 3 years to sort of get back to the demand levels that we were experiencing in \u201818 and \u201819. But I think it\u2019s sort of \u2013 that is sort of the broader trajectory we will be in this hopefully 45%, 50% range and then moving our way steadily, slow and steady up from there. I do think there is a decent likelihood, I am not a health expert, but I am certainly talking to a lot of them. And folks in the government and the like on a daily basis, I do think there is a reasonably good chance that we will have not just a vaccine, but a sweet of different vaccines that get approved sometime in the fall. That will have different levels of effectiveness, but combined will be reasonably effective. And I think that\u2019s going to help. Obviously that\u2019s going to sort I think, help move us a little bit more rapidly through the health issues and then just into the economic issues. I do think if you get that you will see some step change in mobility and thus travel, particularly business travel just because that incremental person that is reticent to travel without it is going to have more confidence to do it. But I still think I stand by what I said, I think you could have \u2013 you could and will probably have a step change up on the occurrence of that. You will even without it continue grinding up and then we will take \u2013 it will take some time to get, because I don\u2019t think we should be under any illusion that even with a vaccine, we are going to be back at \u201818 or \u201819 levels of business transient travel demand for a period of time just because the economic impact has been significant and it will workout \u2013 and over the next 2 or 3 years, but it will take.\nCarlo Santarelli: Very helpful, Chris. Thank you very much for that. And then just if I could one follow-up the net unit growth obviously the 3.5% to 4%, down from what you said before, but in the current environment, certainly not bad. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what the components of that look like, what you are seeing in terms of conversion activity, how aggressive you have been able to be etcetera on that front?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s obviously Carlo lower than what we thought of pre-COVID, it\u2019s higher than what we thought last quarter. It\u2019s moved up a tick. I think we said last quarter about midpoint of our guidance, which would be in the low-3s and now we are midpoint of our current guidance is in the high 3s. And I would probably, with what I see today, I would probably bet based on what we are seeing, it would be towards the higher end of that, if all goes well. I think conversions are going to play a role in it. They certainly will be. We have a lot of momentum there. In terms of the deals that we are signing and that are in active discussions, I think those are up circa 50%, from where they were last year in conversions. Some of that will translate into this year and a lot of it \u2013 a lot more of it will translate into next year. So, I think a larger component of the dug will be conversions. But it\u2019s \u2013 the latest data that I am seeing is probably 5 points, 4, 5, 6 points, I think it will be significantly more than that next year, just because the world sort of while conversions are obviously sort of in keeping with what\u2019s going on in the broader environment. We went through a period of time of 3 or 4 months where sort of nothing was getting done. Now, we are in lots of active discussions. Those deals need to be negotiated. In some cases, you need to do CapEx work, property improvement programs and get it into the system. And so some of that \u2013 a bunch of that\u2019s going to happen this year. As I said, we will have we will have meaningful incremental percentage this year, but I think a lot more just time wise by the time things get done, we will be into next year. And I do think the combination of that with the properties that were new construction that got delayed, because of the freezing of time during particularly most of the second quarter will mean next year will be a better NUG year. I don\u2019t think it will be back to where we were yet. I think it will take a couple of years to get back to where we were. But I just think the math, the math of how NUG is going to work is going to \u2013 is going to \u2013 it does strongly suggest that our 3.5% to 4% is sort of the low point in this cycle and then next year is better and then we are \u2013 then we are moving our way back to a more stabilized environment. I mean, what\u2019s interesting, you didn\u2019t ask it, but somebody will, we are still \u2013 there are few months that everybody is frozen, we are still signing a lot of deals and getting a lot of deals under construction. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t hold me to it, because data is not perfect these days, in the sense that it\u2019s hard to \u2013 hard to know exactly what people are going to do, but best \u2013 our best guess is that we will probably sign \u2013 our signings maybe down circa 20%. Our starts right now look like they are down circa 10% and then we already talked about NUG. So that\u2019s why the pipeline numbers are looking good as we are still signing lots of deals that we are eventually going to open and we are not opening them as fast. So the math becomes pretty, pretty simple to explain there. So, we are \u2013 I have been surprised honestly to the good on activity on the development side on all fronts. I have been surprised on how many deals were getting signed. I have been surprised to the good on how many are going under construction. And as I said, our NUG numbers are sort of inching up, which is a pleasant surprise. So, we are still \u2013 we are still working hard in the Country Garden deal, I think is a testament to the fact that like we are not crying in our milk. We got a business to run. We got great brands. This too shall pass. We will get back to a more normalized environment and we got to be forward \u2013 we people we have to deal with the current environment which I think we have quite well, but we also have to look forward, I think Country Garden, which was \u2013 which we are working on pre-COVID obviously if it got done is a testament to the fact that we are dealing with it here now and we are also dealing with the future all at the same time, which is what we get paid to do.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great, Chris. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question.\nChris Nassetta: Hey, Shaun.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, Chris. So, just wanted to maybe follow-up, I mean obviously some very difficult decisions were made in the quarter as it relates to kind of the broader corporate cost structure and operating structure for Hilton here. How can you help us think about, what happens as trend lines continue to improve and what parts of this \u2013 are these reductions need to come back, because these were really volume driven pieces of business versus how much of this kind of go forward you can\u2019t actually rethink or possibly be a little bit more efficient going forward. Just any thoughts or color on that?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Hey, Shaun, it\u2019s Kevin, I will take this one. I\u2019d say look, obviously it\u2019s going to be a combination of both of those things, right. We do have \u2013 we do have parts of our business. That\u2019s obviously a very complicated business. There are parts that are sort of purely volume and there are parts where it\u2019s not as much volume and we can be more efficient. I\u2019d say the way to think about it is for our corporate costs, for our corporate G&A, we gave you guidance last time that will be down around 25% to 30%. We are coming in right along those lines, most of the moves that we ended up making were largely thought through when we gave that guidance if not final decisions had been made, but it was certainly factored into our guidance. I\u2019d say, in that part of the business, the way to think about it is most of the cost will be sustained \u2013 cost savings will be sustainable. There will be some elements of furloughs and salary reductions that obviously won\u2019t repeat themselves and created touch of a headwind. And then of course that\u2019s offset by the fact that the reductions in force then get annualized going forward, which will be largely permanent savings. And so as the business comes back, some level of inflationary type expense growth, you should expect to come back, but I would say for some period of time, it should be quite sustainable.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, Chris. Good morning, Kevin.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning.\nKevin Jacobs: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Greff: You mentioned and referred to the nice occupancy gains where the portfolio is in that 45% to 50% range, I think you referenced to 50% in one of the answers to the questions. I was hoping maybe you can frame it, maybe you said it and I missed it, but how \u2013 how are you doing or tracking from a rate perspective? Maybe you can kind of put it into perspective of 3Q to-date July RevPAR trends and kind of benchmark that against the industry data domestically and globally? And then I have a follow-up.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I would say, our performance weighted for the industry is maybe a touch better when you adjust for the difference in methodology, which is that we are keeping all of our hotels, even the hotels that closed temporarily or are still closed in our comp set. If you \u2013 and star is not if you adjust for that and we are on top of \u2013 or a little bit better. I would say on the rate side of things, we have seen improvement basically for the quarter, at the beginning of the quarter, rate was down, of that like, April was almost 90% down in RevPAR, about 35% down in rate. If you look at July, that\u2019s 25% down. And if you look at where the trend line is going in August and beyond, it\u2019s coming down. I mean, I think the rate thing is a really \u2013 we have had a lot of discussion about it here, because lots of questions on is the industry going to maintain rate integrity and all that. I think, what is really behind the rate issue as we dig into the data and it doesn\u2019t take much digging, because there is not that much data these days or not as much as normal. It\u2019s really a mix issue, which is we have \u2013 the traditional customer of ours particularly has been a higher rated leisure and a higher rated business traveler. There is just not as many of them at the moment traveling for all the reasons that you guys know. And so it\u2019s a different sort of population, not entirely, but largely different than we are used to, which is much more not to be judgmental, but a much lower and lower price point customer and so the issue for all of us in the industry, I can\u2019t speak for what others have done that speak for us is we have owners that are really hurting and we are trying to do everything we can to help them, because no business is built for sort of what was happening, which is like the limited or no revenue and then very, very low levels of revenue and so in this very difficult time, along with our consultation with our owners, our view was, whatever business is out there to help them we need to go after it. And so what\u2019s happened is race have come down largely as a result, I\u2019m not going to say there isn\u2019t great pressure broadly in an environment like this, everybody expects a bargain. So yes, there is rate pressure broadly, but if you look at the data, if you look at the math, the bulk of it is just mix We are now in this environment we have gone after directly some through the OTAs, but largely through our own through our own channels with honors, and all of our marketing campaigns and marketing spend, lower funnel has been going after that lower rated leisure traveler because it has been the bulk of what is out there to get and we need to we need to help our owners get to the other side of this. And so when you when you mix that in, it\u2019s just added, it starts even pre COVID at a much lower price point. And I think so I think that is what\u2019s going on with ADR. I think while there\u2019ll be pressure on ADR because of the economic issues that have been caused, as a result of COVID, and it would be silly to say there won\u2019t be I think you will get, I think that the pressures that you saw in the second quarter that are still ongoing, when you get back to the new level of what I will call a new normalized environment, where you have many more of our traditional travelers, higher end leisure and higher end business transients, travelers on the road again, I think this will, will write itself in quite rapidly.\nJoe Greff: Great. And one of the answers is a nice segue to my follow up question. Based on what we were able to ascertain from the release, it doesn\u2019t seem that any kind of third party collections issues with a significant working capital or free cash flow drag in the 2Q one is our premise. They are correct. And then two, has there been any trend change in the 3Q and would you anticipate them? Maybe first more broadly, that if there are issues, there would be some sort of lag or how do you view that? And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Thanks. Joe. I would say look, what I would say generally on the collections and broadly working capital side is, obviously relative to the guidance we gave you last quarter things generally went better than we thought and I would say that is across the board on terms of in terms of the buckets of, in the managed portfolio and in terms of payment of fees and the like. We are we do in this in this environment. We have built some receivables we are sort of collecting at a slower pace than normal which is completely understandable given what is going on in the world and given what our owners are going through But I would say again, largely better than we thought, sort of obviously, everything that\u2019s happened was captured in the numbers nothing is really changed so far in the third quarter, although we should point out that it\u2019s still early in the third quarter, and there is a lot of year left, but so, so far, it\u2019s, been going quite well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Thanks. I am going to follow-up on that last question on working capital and also tying in reimbursed costs how should investors think about how these will trend in a more sustained recovery? I mean, do you just get back to break even or could you actually get incremental revenue or income in from those relative to the expenses?\nKevin Jacobs: Well, revenue doesn\u2019t get re-collections doesn\u2019t affect the way we recognize revenue. And so I think you could see in you could see on The P&L that, in the in the funded part of the business or the reimbursable part of the business, we did spend more than we then we earned in this quarter, which is completely normal. if you think about what is going on in the world, and how quickly revenues decline anything from a cash basis, we would expect to get the vast majority of it will be repaid. And so you should think about there will be a flip around on the cash side that did doesn\u2019t necessarily correspond with what you\u2019re seeing on the P&L on the revenue side.\nStephen Grambling: Got it. And then you also referenced on the distribution side a little bit on the OTAs here. I guess prior to COVID. I think there was a heavy direct booking campaign and there was maybe some hope that consumer preferences may change, such that in a downturn, you might start to see less focus or less emphasis on the OTAs given the current environment, I guess in some ways you think would argue for more inventory going to the OTAs are you seeing that change in behavior or there is any other data points that you can provide that might glean some insight there?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. And I think I sort of touched on it, indirectly. Yes, in this environment, you just heard what I said about the biggest bucket of demand, which is lower price leisure demand that would typically favor OTAs. That is typically what we have used over time, the OTAs for to supplement the other pools of our demand that we have very direct access to. And so you would think this would mean that our distribution channel mix would be shifting in that way, but reality is it has not. Our direct channels in part because of what we have been doing, because we do want to continue to build direct relationships with customers of all sorts, including these customers who we hope may not have been our typical customer before, but we hope we will adopt our system during COVID and post-COVID and we will add to the complement of customers that we have. And so, the OTA business from a distribution point of view has held relatively constant. Our direct channels are growing at a faster pace. And that is, as I said \u2013 that is because of our actions, not so much and what we are doing and with the SAs, but very much how we are spending our marketing dollars and how we are orienting our Honors programs to access that type of customer.\nStephen Grambling: Make sense. Thank you so much. Best of luck in the back half from and to the west.\nChris Nassetta: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nThomas Allen: Hi, good morning. So you guys have obviously had a long experience operating hotels and so on some hotels in the past have a lot of hotels. Kevin, this big picture, how are you thinking of the overall hotel operating cost structure will change in the future versus pre-COVID levels? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Hi, Tom, it\u2019s a really good question and I would say that deserves a good answer as always. I will give you an answer. I am not in a position at the moment yet to be highly specific, but I will certainly answer it directionally. And the fact of the matter is we are spending probably more time on that right now inside our organization than any other single thing that we are doing. For all the reasons you would guess, I mean, in the early stages of COVID and continuing our effort with our owners, because we need to help them bridge this very difficult time had been to provide a tremendous amount of flexibility against our standards of all sorts, in terms of food and beverage standards, operating of across the board and reality is doing a lot of work with our customer base. That\u2019s what they expected. Everybody knows we are in a different world and the things are going to be different. We will get back to a more normalized world, but we want to use this opportunity to really dive very deeply into each and every brand which we are doing both the CapEx and OpEx standards to see if we can\u2019t drive far greater efficiency. Now, the trick is and the needles that we are not just trying, but we will thread is we have the best brands in the business and those brands have the highest premiums in the industry. In COVID world, it\u2019s like anarchy across the world, but we are going to get out of that in the not too distant future and these brands will continue to have the premiums, but the reality is, like any business over time in any industry, you add things, you add things you are \u2013 I would argue, we all have been better at adding things and taking things away. And so what we are doing in a simple way working very closely with customers is figuring out what are the things that are most important to driving those premiums and what are the things that don\u2019t matter and it\u2019s the things that don\u2019t matter, or they were from yesteryear and they might have helped, 10 years ago, but they don\u2019t matter as much today, then we don\u2019t need to be doing those things. And then looking just at the engineering, particularly in the limited service space of every single element of the hotel, like food and beverage, to the penny on cost per occupied room and the like and so I am \u2013 I am not just optimistic, I will say we are going to find for our ownership community significant savings at the same time, I believe finding a way to make these brands even better and even more relevant to customers, because we will lean in heavier to the things that matter and get it and get out of the things that does not matter so I know in the end, you guys like to translate everything to a model and would like to, would like to build a model for the ownership community. What that means I can\u2019t tell you because we are race, we are literally deep in the middle of it. And we have got a very large group of our most important and knowledgeable owners that are at the table with us we have, we are in constant communication with a broad array, representing our customer base. And I think it\u2019s really exciting work that, if you would have to take an \u201818 or \u201819 sort of normalized demand level, we will clearly be driving in every one of our brands, higher margins, just because we are going to necessity I used this I have said this too many times in my career, which bums me out but necessity becomes the mother of invention. Well, I think our brands our brands are the best and drove great margins and we got disproportionate share of pipeline because our brands performed better top line and bottom line than our competitors. That\u2019s not good enough. We, right now our owners are suffering, it\u2019s going to be, a long dig out and we know we can create greater efficiencies and at the same time, not in any way threatened, but enhance our premiums.\nThomas Allen: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I wonder if you could give us a little color on the conversations that you are having with your corporate customers. I don\u2019t know if this is a little too early for when you would normally have corporate pre negotiated rates, discussions, but are our corporate buyers just sort of saying, Hey, we don\u2019t even need have this conversation call me in six months I guess if you could give us a little insight into what your big buyers of business travel historically are saying?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, I mean, it is a little early, Robin, but it\u2019s a really good question. And I would ask it to, with I think next quarter, we will have a heck of a lot more to say, because we will have had a lot more conversation, I would say. And I am going to, I\u2019m going to put it into the three big buckets, okay, I think a third, a third, a third. And this is I am being more scientific than reality but sort of in my own head, that\u2019s how plays out a third of our, of our big corporate customers are super understanding of what\u2019s going on. And they are of the belief that whatever deal we had to just continue on, and, and there\u2019s want to be supportive in this environment. They probably, for a period of time, we are going to be traveling less, but they want to sort of continue on with the basic pricing parameters that they had, and they\u2019ve signed up for that, I would say and again, I we are just more early in the season of this dialogue. So it could change, I would say a third of them don\u2019t know, okay, there\u2019s sort of like, gosh, I don\u2019t know what to do. This is a crazy world, I sort of hear what you are saying, maybe we should just keep going. But there is sort of contemplative, and then a third are saying, it\u2019s a really crazy world and, and we want we got to get a better deal. Okay, that\u2019s, we are suffering. If we are going to travel and we are going to stay with you we got to get a better deal. And I would say that\u2019s as much as I know, at the moment, I think in the end, that third that are in the middle, I think half of them go both ways. I think it\u2019s sort of 50-50 when I talked to our sales teams, and it\u2019s all anecdotal for the record, it\u2019s not like this is scientific data, but I\u2019m talking to them all the time. every single week, at least once, they will say it\u2019s or like half of our big corporate customers get it, they want to be supportive, they that they are not going to beat us up in half are sort of like, nah, I, got to get a better deal because the world my world blew up too. So we will see how it plays out. As I said there will be an environment where you get through the health situation and you are in a economic downturn, there is going to be as there always is some pressures on rate people are going to expect a bargain for everything, most things that they are doing. I my own belief is that will not be intense pressure, certainly not reflective of what you are seeing in the current environment. As I said to an earlier question, much of the rate degradation, the bulk of the rate degradation, as far as I can tell at this point, is really just the mix. It\u2019s just a different customer base. There will be pressure, but not this kind of pressure on rates as you get to a more normalized environment.\nRobin Farley: That\u2019s great. Thank you. And maybe just as my follow-up still thinking about sort of intentions of travelers, can you give color on for group bookings? Obviously, I am sure things like we hear from others are canceling through Q1, but our new group bookings coming in for next year are not really, is there a pause even people?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, they are. Intentions keep picking up. I mean, you\u2019re right, I think all of \u2013 like what we are seeing broadly is, you know, a lot of it, we are doing some group by the way, in the second quarter, we did like 10% of our volume was group. I think it will be higher in the third and fourth quarter for what it\u2019s worth. So \u2013 but again, it\u2019s not our typical groups, it\u2019s like \u2013 it\u2019s groups related to the crisis, it\u2019s businesses in small group meetings where they just have to do it, but their offices aren\u2019t really open yet. I mean, they are \u2013 and we are getting a lot of that kind of stuff. But I mean, it\u2019s obviously a small fraction of what it typically would be. I do think it will keep picking up, because those sort of other types of groups are going to keep picking up as the year goes on, but the traditional bigger group meetings and all that, that are kind of a bread and butter in the fall, those are going to keep getting kicked out. A bunch of them are still on the books for the rest of year, but I think a lot of that will wash out. And as day by day you sort of see that washing out and people are kicking the can into next year with again the hopes that the health crisis be low will pass and/or through a vaccine, herd immunity, whatever is going to happen. And the further we go in the year the further they sort of kick it out, because there is a lot of noise in the system and it makes them nervous about wanting to spend a lot of time and money planning a meeting, they might have to \u2013 they might have to cancel. So, I would say, where it starts to stiffen up a bit is \u2013 starting in Q2 of next year. I think people \u2013 the psychology of it is for third and fourth quarter you will see groups, but it\u2019s sort of group meetings at a necessity or a replacement for something what happened into your office and that will pickup as time goes on. But the core sort of traditional group business is going to kick forward to Q2 through Q4 next year and we are both moving business that is cancelling, we are moving every bit we can and which is most of it to a future date. And we are booking new business. I mean, they are \u2013 we are booking tens of millions of dollars a week of new business for periods in the future, most of which is starting in the second quarter next year. So, a lot of it will \u2013 again, you get \u2013 it\u2019s like there is so many unknowns. You get a vaccine it changes the game on a lot of these things. Again, you still have the economic situation to deal with and people have still been damaged in that way. But I think it frees up a lot \u2013 it creates a decent amount of momentum, because the fear goes away. So I think we just have to see where all this \u2013 see where all of this goes through the fall. I mean, again, I feel pretty good about where things are going with vaccines. There certainly is a lot of data out there that says as you get to the later part of this year and early next, even if you don\u2019t have a vaccine, you are going to be at a point of herd immunity, because enough people are either naturally have the natural antibodies, T-cells and/or have been exposed in a way where it just can\u2019t spread the same way that it has. Again, I am not a health expert like you I read a lot of stuff. I think we just have to sort of get watch it really carefully in the fall. And on the current course, I think all segments will continue to grind up. Group will obviously be the longest last, because people require spending, planning and right now, most people don\u2019t want to do that. Alright, they just \u2013 they don\u2019t want to do that, because they are afraid they are wasting time and money.\nRobin Farley: Does that mean actually that what you have on the books for second half of next year is actually kind of ahead of what it would normally be, in other words versus the same time last year for?\nChris Nassetta: No, I don\u2019t have the data in front of me, but no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. And it\u2019s not yet. I think it could \u2013 it could eventually build to that. And if things go well, it will, I think, but not at the moment, no, we are not where we were.\nRobin Farley: Thank you. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question will be from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: Good morning. Thanks very much. One of your competitors said a couple of days agothey are expecting business travel to be to see a behavioral change and about a 10% behavioral change. Am I right in thinking you don\u2019t adhere to that? And I guess their point was they would have to make up for that with alternative revenue sources, whether that\u2019s skewing more towards leisure or using the hotels in a slightly different way and is that something also you\u2019re looking to contemplate going forward?\nChris Nassetta: Well, I think that I didn\u2019t mean to ply anything on that, as far as I was concerned. And so if I if I did, what I meant, but in answer to that question, I would say, I mean, there\u2019s, that there is a raging debate about that, but I think will be ongoing over the next 3 years. My belief is from having done this for 37 years and while we have not had a pandemic like this, we have had lots of other things, lots of other similar things that have disrupted the environment that, in the short intermediate term, you are definitely going to have a substitution effect because people businesses have been damaged. And as a result, they are going to have to have find ways to cut costs and save money and so they are going to substitute zoom in for certain types of meetings, and it will they will have an impact in the short intermediate term. I think over the long term, there will be and by the way, as a result, we of course are looking as we are now at every opportunity of how we utilize our all of our rooms and all our public spaces and everything else in creative ways to be able to supplement and find different pockets of demand, whether that be leisure, whether that be using rooms as offices in an environment where people aren\u2019t, opening offices because we have a safe environment where people can be socially distanced by definition, etcetera. We are doing all those things. I personally believe when you wake up in two or three years, and you can, you can, we will all mark this moment and let\u2019s talk in three years, I think we will have a raging debate this business travel will never be the same. And it will look, it may look like that, because businesses have been hobbled a lot of them and it will be lower for a while, I have already said, I think it takes two or three years to get back. I think what we will find when we wake up in three years, it\u2019ll be more like it was in 18 and 19, than it is now. There will be a substitution effect. There will be different. There will be certain types of business travel that probably forever will change whoever said 10%, God bless them. I am not smart enough to figure that out. I have read a bunch of pundits have had views, I don\u2019t know. But at the same time, like every other time, there will be other things and other needs for travel that will emerge. And so I think while it will take a few years to get back, I think, one way or another we will have similar levels of demand, both for business transients and group people will want to congregate people will have to meet will have to build relationships, if anything that zoom in WebEx, I think has taught us it\u2019s really hard, to build a real relationship this way. So, maybe a bunch of internal meetings or whatever, there are some things I mean, that\u2019s all we are doing. There is some things that I think will be what percentage and I know will sort of become a more permanent way of doing things, but they will be they will be supplanted by other forms of travel where people are going to are going to be out traveling for things that that they haven\u2019t been traveling for. And so, short intermediate term, we absolutely have scrambled every jet we got to think about a weaker business transients demand environments to fill those gaps. We and I believe longer term it will recover to similar level.\nRichard Clarke: If I can just ask a quick follow up, obviously, on your franchise agreements the fee structure is heavily skewed towards room revenue. Is there a need to sort of reopen franchise agreement to make sure that you are aligned with the hotels to drive all these alternative sources of revenue as well?\nChris Nassetta: Well, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, the reality is in a big full service hotel, our revenue \u2013 our fees are generally based on both food and beverage and rooms and other revenues. So in the big complex hotels that already \u2013 we already do that in a limited service hotel, let\u2019s be honest, there is pretty much only rooms. So we don\u2019t have a lot of other infrastructure or capacity in the facility in most limited service, like a Hampton Inn, there isn\u2019t a lot of meeting space. By the way, that\u2019s part of room revenue in any event. There is a \u2013 it\u2019s a small lobby. It\u2019s a different animal. And so there really is rooms, it\u2019s in those hotels if you are \u2013 if you don\u2019t have your traditional customers it\u2019s what other ways can you sell rooms. Like I said, you could sell them as office space, you can do, there are things that you sell them as dormitories, which we are doing like crazy, right. We have done dozens and dozens of deals across the country with universities. We are doing all those things, but that \u2013 but all that flows through room revenues and I think the incentives are properly aligned already generally.\nRichard Clarke: Great. Thanks very much.\nChris Nassetta: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hey, thanks. I just wanted to ask you kind of going back to your pipeline, when you talk with your developers, what are they seeing or telling you in terms of how banks are thinking about financing new construction at this point? And maybe kind of if you could talk about it relative to kind of franchise limited service properties and then maybe anything you are seeing on the full service side?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, I think it\u2019s a good question, Smedes. I think it\u2019s a little early, I would say what people are saying everybody is being mean, look we are in the middle of a global pandemic, right. So I think everybody is being a touch more conservative about everything. I mean, that\u2019s why you sort of see, you hear Chris talking about us pivoting, towards conversions and the like. I would say, generally speaking, though projects that make sense can still get financed, there is a ton of capital on the world. Rates are low, if people are willing to equitize, if they have the equity \u2013 if they are willing to equitize a little bit more, they can get deals done and they and their lenders can collectively \u2013 can collaboratively look towards the future and say hey, look, we are going to open this thing up into - -hopefully open this thing up into a new cycle. And so generally people are still working on that stuff. And then as it relates to the mix, what we were already seeing was much more demand in the smaller limited service type hotels, the bigger more complicated full service hotels largely didn\u2019t get built a lot this cycle, because the recovery never justified them building costs kept going up, labor costs kept going up. And so they really weren\u2019t all that active in terms of construction anyway. So that\u2019s really not, that precise of an answer I think, because it is a little early, but you should assume a little bit more conservatism across the board.\nSmedes Rose: Thanks. And then Chris, can I just follow-up with you. You talked a little bit about the operating model, that question came up earlier. Just one thing that\u2019s come up with owners is the idea of suspending housekeeping during a guest stay and making that just kind of a permanent part of the hotel operating business. Do you think that\u2019s really on the table and does that meaningfully change the margin from an owner\u2019s perspective kind of all else equal?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, we are right in the middle of that, Smedes. So, I don\u2019t really have an answer. Everything is on the table, first of all. I mean, we are \u2013 it\u2019s that along with literally hundreds of other things around the table. That\u2019s probably one of the bigger things. We have agreed already with our owners in the short to intermediate term to do that as part of our launch of clean stay, because we think it is a better protocol for cleanliness to not have third-parties in the room. And so we clean the room. We seal \u2013 literally put a seal on the door. And only if a customer requests it, so it\u2019s an opt in, do we have somebody come in and do a limited cleaning that obviously based on the fact that people have been not opting in at a high rate, that is helpful from a margin point of view. We also think it\u2019s helpful from a cleanliness point of view, which is why it was part of clean stay. What we are doing is using this moment, which at a minimum that will go through this year to figure out with our customers what they really want. I mean, what we are trying to do is thread the needle with our customer and our owner community to make sure that, what I said in my earlier comment that we are ultimately giving our customers what they want, so they will pay a big premium for our product. And we are doing in a way that drives the best margins humanly possible for our owners. And we have to satisfy both constituencies. And so what we are doing between now and the end of the year is looking at a lot of data, we are doing it, so we now have a real test that is system-wide that is live, that is allowing us to look at data to see the behavior of the consumer to talk to consumers about their views on this. And so it\u2019s definitely on the table, but we don\u2019t yet have enough data to have an answer and I think the idea is that we will through the rest of this year, be studying it and figure out based on that data what the right answer is.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Thanks everybody for the time. Obviously, Q2, not a shining moment in our 100-year history, but I guess this is what happens when you have a global pandemic we found out. I have lived through a lots of different things over the years and this is certainly \u2013 has stressed the limits of I think what all of us have seen. But I am really, as I said in my comments, I am very proud of how we have responded. I mean, we have taken a difficult situation I think and are managing our way through it quite well. Our team has been working tirelessly, fewer of them working even harder. And I feel as good as I did pre-COVID about the long-term prospects for this business, it may not feel that way to you all right now, but I do think when we wake up in 2 or 3 years, we will be back on track and this business will be performing as will the industry quite well. We look forward to talking to you after Q3. Every quarter, we learn a lot. So I suspect we will have a little bit better visibility into the trajectory of recovery, maybe even have some knowledge on vaccines as all of us etcetera. So we will look forward to catching you up after Q3. Take care and be well.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

            "name": "Kevin Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. In the quarter, as Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR declined 81% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis with decreases across all chain scales and regions. Decreases were largely driven by occupancy declines with rate pressure from increased competition for lower rated business further impacting results. We did however see sequential improvement throughout the quarter, particularly in China and the U.S. Adjusted EBITDA was $51 million in the second quarter, declining 92% year-over-year. Results reflect the significant reduction in global travel demand due to COVID-19 and the subsequent temporary suspension of operations at more than 1,000 hotels at some point in the quarter. Revenue declines were mitigated by greater cost control at the corporate and property levels. Management franchise fees decreased 77% to $135 million driven by RevPAR declines and unfavorable timing of license fees. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to significant closures, fixed operating cost and fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Results were mitigated by cost control tactics across the portfolio. Diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.61. Turning to liquidity, we ended the quarter with total cash and equivalents of nearly $3.6 billion following a number of actions taken early in the quarter to enhance our position and increase our financial flexibility. Additionally, our cash burn during the second quarter was lower than expected partially due to the timing of certain payments. As we look at the balance of the year, we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to navigate the current environment and prepare for recovery. Further details on our second quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question please? Yes. Hey, Shaun, it's Kevin, I will take this one. I'd say look, obviously it's going to be a combination of both of those things, right. We do have \u2013 we do have parts of our business. That's obviously a very complicated business. There are parts that are sort of purely volume and there are parts where it's not as much volume and we can be more efficient. I'd say the way to think about it is for our corporate costs, for our corporate G&A, we gave you guidance last time that will be down around 25% to 30%. We are coming in right along those lines, most of the moves that we ended up making were largely thought through when we gave that guidance if not final decisions had been made, but it was certainly factored into our guidance. I'd say, in that part of the business, the way to think about it is most of the cost will be sustained \u2013 cost savings will be sustainable. There will be some elements of furloughs and salary reductions that obviously won't repeat themselves and created touch of a headwind. And then of course that's offset by the fact that the reductions in force then get annualized going forward, which will be largely permanent savings. And so as the business comes back, some level of inflationary type expense growth, you should expect to come back, but I would say for some period of time, it should be quite sustainable. Sure. Hey, Joe. Yes. Thanks. Joe. I would say look, what I would say generally on the collections and broadly working capital side is, obviously relative to the guidance we gave you last quarter things generally went better than we thought and I would say that is across the board on terms of in terms of the buckets of, in the managed portfolio and in terms of payment of fees and the like. We are we do in this in this environment. We have built some receivables we are sort of collecting at a slower pace than normal which is completely understandable given what is going on in the world and given what our owners are going through But I would say again, largely better than we thought, sort of obviously, everything that's happened was captured in the numbers nothing is really changed so far in the third quarter, although we should point out that it's still early in the third quarter, and there is a lot of year left, but so, so far, it's, been going quite well. Well, revenue doesn't get re-collections doesn't affect the way we recognize revenue. And so I think you could see in you could see on The P&L that, in the in the funded part of the business or the reimbursable part of the business, we did spend more than we then we earned in this quarter, which is completely normal. if you think about what is going on in the world, and how quickly revenues decline anything from a cash basis, we would expect to get the vast majority of it will be repaid. And so you should think about there will be a flip around on the cash side that did doesn't necessarily correspond with what you're seeing on the P&L on the revenue side. Yes. Hi, Tom, it's a really good question and I would say that deserves a good answer as always. I will give you an answer. I am not in a position at the moment yet to be highly specific, but I will certainly answer it directionally. And the fact of the matter is we are spending probably more time on that right now inside our organization than any other single thing that we are doing. For all the reasons you would guess, I mean, in the early stages of COVID and continuing our effort with our owners, because we need to help them bridge this very difficult time had been to provide a tremendous amount of flexibility against our standards of all sorts, in terms of food and beverage standards, operating of across the board and reality is doing a lot of work with our customer base. That's what they expected. Everybody knows we are in a different world and the things are going to be different. We will get back to a more normalized world, but we want to use this opportunity to really dive very deeply into each and every brand which we are doing both the CapEx and OpEx standards to see if we can't drive far greater efficiency. Now, the trick is and the needles that we are not just trying, but we will thread is we have the best brands in the business and those brands have the highest premiums in the industry. In COVID world, it's like anarchy across the world, but we are going to get out of that in the not too distant future and these brands will continue to have the premiums, but the reality is, like any business over time in any industry, you add things, you add things you are \u2013 I would argue, we all have been better at adding things and taking things away. And so what we are doing in a simple way working very closely with customers is figuring out what are the things that are most important to driving those premiums and what are the things that don't matter and it's the things that don't matter, or they were from yesteryear and they might have helped, 10 years ago, but they don't matter as much today, then we don't need to be doing those things. And then looking just at the engineering, particularly in the limited service space of every single element of the hotel, like food and beverage, to the penny on cost per occupied room and the like and so I am \u2013 I am not just optimistic, I will say we are going to find for our ownership community significant savings at the same time, I believe finding a way to make these brands even better and even more relevant to customers, because we will lean in heavier to the things that matter and get it and get out of the things that does not matter so I know in the end, you guys like to translate everything to a model and would like to, would like to build a model for the ownership community. What that means I can't tell you because we are race, we are literally deep in the middle of it. And we have got a very large group of our most important and knowledgeable owners that are at the table with us we have, we are in constant communication with a broad array, representing our customer base. And I think it's really exciting work that, if you would have to take an \u201818 or \u201819 sort of normalized demand level, we will clearly be driving in every one of our brands, higher margins, just because we are going to necessity I used this I have said this too many times in my career, which bums me out but necessity becomes the mother of invention. Well, I think our brands our brands are the best and drove great margins and we got disproportionate share of pipeline because our brands performed better top line and bottom line than our competitors. That's not good enough. We, right now our owners are suffering, it's going to be, a long dig out and we know we can create greater efficiencies and at the same time, not in any way threatened, but enhance our premiums. Yes, I think it's a good question, Smedes. I think it's a little early, I would say what people are saying everybody is being mean, look we are in the middle of a global pandemic, right. So I think everybody is being a touch more conservative about everything. I mean, that's why you sort of see, you hear Chris talking about us pivoting, towards conversions and the like. I would say, generally speaking, though projects that make sense can still get financed, there is a ton of capital on the world. Rates are low, if people are willing to equitize, if they have the equity \u2013 if they are willing to equitize a little bit more, they can get deals done and they and their lenders can collectively \u2013 can collaboratively look towards the future and say hey, look, we are going to open this thing up into - -hopefully open this thing up into a new cycle. And so generally people are still working on that stuff. And then as it relates to the mix, what we were already seeing was much more demand in the smaller limited service type hotels, the bigger more complicated full service hotels largely didn't get built a lot this cycle, because the recovery never justified them building costs kept going up, labor costs kept going up. And so they really weren't all that active in terms of construction anyway. So that's really not, that precise of an answer I think, because it is a little early, but you should assume a little bit more conservatism across the board."

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Before we get started, I would like to offer our sympathies to all those affected by the recent explosion in Beirut, our thoughts are with our team members and everybody impacted by this tragic event. It goes without saying that these past several months have been challenging. While we have continued to navigate the global coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our business and the communities we serve globally. Here in the U.S., we have also witnessed tragic acts of social injustice leading to difficult, but necessary discussions regarding systemic inequalities. For more than a century, our hotels have been a welcoming place for all, a place where we bring together people of all backgrounds and connect them to the light and warmth of our hospitality. Now more than ever, Hilton remains committed to fostering an inclusive culture and driving positive change in our communities and society more broadly. Building on the work we have been doing, we have set even more aggressive leadership diversity targets across our corporate and hotel teams. As we announced yesterday, we are happy to welcome Chris Carr to our board of directors. Chris brings several decades of executive leadership across global consumer companies and we look forward to his insights and diversity of thoughts as we focus on our near-term recovery and long-term growth opportunities. Unfortunately, the new reality of our business required us to adapt our organizational structure moving forward. During the quarter, we took additional measures to further reduce costs, including the reduction of approximately 2,100 corporate roles globally and the extension of previously announced furloughs. These were very difficult decisions as our company's culture has always been centered on supporting our team members who deliver hospitality for our guests. Through these challenging times, I am proud of how our team has continued to live our Hilton values to have integrity, to deliver exceptional guests experiences, and to be leaders in our industry and in our communities. We are working hard to restore confidence to travel again and have taken a number of measures to enhance the safety of our team members and guests. In June, we launched Hilton Clean Stay in collaboration with Lysol and the Mayo Clinic to provide industry leading hygiene practices in our properties all around the world. Our new elevated standards include modifying housekeeping procedures and adjusting common areas in our hotels to support social distancing. As part of the program, we also recently launched Hilton Event Ready, which sets new standards for cleanliness and customer service for meetings and events. Additionally, we are requiring everyone inside our hotels in the U.S. to wear face coverings in all indoor public spaces. Long before COVID-19, we had invested heavily in technology to give our Hilton Honors members access to seamless and contactless experiences with our Hilton Honors app. Today, our Honors members can benefit from features like digital check-in, room selection and the ability to message with hotel team members from their own device. Additionally, digital key allows for contactless check-in and check-out at the vast majority of our hotels globally. Combined with our new approaches to cleanliness, we think these are important initiatives on the road to reassuring guests of a safe experience at our hotels as travel resumes, while still delivering exceptional customer service. Turning to the quarter, as expected the pandemic and the related decreases in global travel and tourism materially affected our second quarter results. System-wide RevPAR declined 81% year-over-year with all regions and chain scales meaningfully impacted. Approximately, 20% of our system-wide properties had temporarily suspended operations at some point in the first half of the year. Today, nearly 80% of those hotels have reopened, including all of our hotels in China and the majority of our hotels in the United States. In Europe, we are seeing steady progress on re-openings as restrictions ease and demand gradually return. Today, more than 96% of our system-wide hotels are open and operating. In terms of demand, we are seeing meaningful improvements off the lows in April with monthly sequential increases throughout the quarter and into July. System-wide occupancy rebounded from a low of roughly 13% to approximately 45% currently, with all major regions improving. In Asia-Pacific, performance is largely driven by rebounds in both leisure and business transient travel in China, where occupancy is more than 60%. In the Americas, occupancy is over 45% boosted by increasing demand for limited service hotels and drive to leisure markets. During the 4th of July weekend, nearly 800 hotels in the U.S. ran over 80% occupancy. Across Europe, Middle East and Africa, occupancy is generally around 30%, although easing government restrictions and continued reopening should help drive further improvements there. As we look to the fall, assuming no significant disruptions to the current environment, we hope to see a continuation of the modest pickup in business transient demand, which would help offset slower leisure demand post-summer. However, we remain cautious given the uncertainty surrounding the virus and its overall impact, including the reopening of schools and offices. While we continue to adjust to new ways of interacting, one thing remains consistent, our focus on doing what is right for our guests and their evolving travel needs. For that reason, we made a number of changes very early on. We introduced and have since extended the most flexible cancellation policies in the industry and were among the first global hotel companies to implement rewards extensions to help Honors member maintain their points and status. Through our partnership with American Express, we also enhanced our co-branded credit cards to include more ways for Honors members to earn rewards during this time and provide cardholders with greater flexibility and even more points now to use for future travel. From a development perspective, activity was disrupted given the broader macro challenges yet, we were still able to add 7,000 rooms to our system and achieved 4.8% net unit growth versus the same period last year. Monthly openings increased sequentially throughout the quarter and in June, openings in the Americas were nearly 15% higher than last year. Additionally, we continue to be encouraged by conversion opportunities, which should help mitigate the impact of construction delays. For the full year, we expect net unit growth to be in the 3.5% to 4% range. It will take time for development to fully recover, but we are confident that we have the brands and the commercial engines to continue taking a disproportionate share of the global pipeline. In the quarter, we signed several notable luxury deals, including the Waldorf-Astoria Tokyo, the Conrad Costa del Sol in Spain, and the Oceana in Santa Monica which will join our LXR portfolio. On the conversion side, we saw positive momentum across our Doubletree, Curio and Tapestry brands. As an additional testament to the strength of our development strategy, during the quarter, we signed a management license agreement with Country Garden, one of the strongest players in the Chinese property market to exclusively develop Home2 Suites properties in China. We expect this partnership to produce more than 1,000 hotels over time and look forward to introducing a new brand and segment to the Chinese market. As one of Hilton's fastest growing and award winning brands, we think Home2 is well-positioned to capture additional growth opportunities in the extended stay mid-scale segments in China. Taking the current landscape and uncertainties into considerations, we have a clear path forward. I am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish during these difficult times and I am confident that we will emerge stronger. I think we have demonstrated our flexibility, resiliency and an ability to embrace change, all while continuing to do what's best for our people and the future of our business. With that, I am going to turn the call over to Kevin for a little bit more detail on the second quarter results. Hey, good morning, Carlo. Yes, I'd be happy to. Obviously that is the big question. And I certainly have a view, although I think there is obviously still enough uncertainty out there, where we \u2013 it's hard to be confident in the view, but my view really hasn't changed, Carlo, a whole lot from the last call. And if I think about the shape of the recovery so far, which has gone from a low of basically a little over 10% and now running 45% and moving our way up to 50%. That's \u2013 while those are still terrible numbers, that is a lot of improvement over a relatively short period of time. And if you go back to what I said on the last call, that's sort of what we had expected. I mean, things are sort of moving fairly close to what we would have expected. I said on the last call and I'd sort of say the same thing, I think we are going \u2013 you are going to see a step change from very, very low levels as you start to reopen the world, where you are going to get to 40% to 50% occupancy levels by the end of the summer, early fall and then it's going to be a grind up, because as you get through the health elements of this crisis, you are going to be dealing with an economic crisis or a recessionary environment and businesses and individuals have been impacted. And so, you are going to be on a grind up from there. And that's sort of what I think is happening. I think as you go into the fall, what I would hope is that we are going to be in that 45% to 50% range. You are going to see leisure trail off as you always do, but I think a little less so, it will take a little longer for that to bleed off, because a lot of kids aren't going back to school or that they are, but virtually a lot of offices aren't opening up do you know and so their people are going to be virtual. So, they have a lot more flexibility to sort of extend the leisure travel season and we can already see early telltale signs of that, because it's been very hard to get availability in certain locations in July and August. So, they are extending into September and maybe into October. So, I think you will have a little bit heavier leisure business as you go into the fall, which will be helpful, because that's been significant part of the business. And you will I think continue to see some movement up in business transient. We saw it through the quarter. I mean, if you look at our managed \u2013 our managed business transient segment, which would typically be like last year in June was 20% of our business. In June of 2020, it was 18% of our business. Now, it's a little bit different makeup of business traveler than probably it was last year for the last decade or two or three, but nonetheless, it was business-related travel. So, you are starting to see that come back not rapidly, but slowly. And I do think all things being equal as you get into the fall, you will see that continue. So, I think you are going to hopefully crossover with the pickup \u2013 with dropping off of leisure \u2013 a slight pickup in business and you are going to sort of hang out in that arena and be grinding slowly, but surely as we have been our way up even with the recurrence of COVID in a bunch of parts of the country. We stepped back for 2 or 3 weeks if you look at the data and then we started to march back and grind back up again. And that's \u2013 the grind up again will depend on the trajectory of the overall recovery. I think my own view as I said it last time I think its 2 or 3 years to sort of get back to the demand levels that we were experiencing in \u201818 and \u201819. But I think it's sort of \u2013 that is sort of the broader trajectory we will be in this hopefully 45%, 50% range and then moving our way steadily, slow and steady up from there. I do think there is a decent likelihood, I am not a health expert, but I am certainly talking to a lot of them. And folks in the government and the like on a daily basis, I do think there is a reasonably good chance that we will have not just a vaccine, but a sweet of different vaccines that get approved sometime in the fall. That will have different levels of effectiveness, but combined will be reasonably effective. And I think that's going to help. Obviously that's going to sort I think, help move us a little bit more rapidly through the health issues and then just into the economic issues. I do think if you get that you will see some step change in mobility and thus travel, particularly business travel just because that incremental person that is reticent to travel without it is going to have more confidence to do it. But I still think I stand by what I said, I think you could have \u2013 you could and will probably have a step change up on the occurrence of that. You will even without it continue grinding up and then we will take \u2013 it will take some time to get, because I don't think we should be under any illusion that even with a vaccine, we are going to be back at \u201818 or \u201819 levels of business transient travel demand for a period of time just because the economic impact has been significant and it will workout \u2013 and over the next 2 or 3 years, but it will take. Yes. I mean, it's obviously Carlo lower than what we thought of pre-COVID, it's higher than what we thought last quarter. It's moved up a tick. I think we said last quarter about midpoint of our guidance, which would be in the low-3s and now we are midpoint of our current guidance is in the high 3s. And I would probably, with what I see today, I would probably bet based on what we are seeing, it would be towards the higher end of that, if all goes well. I think conversions are going to play a role in it. They certainly will be. We have a lot of momentum there. In terms of the deals that we are signing and that are in active discussions, I think those are up circa 50%, from where they were last year in conversions. Some of that will translate into this year and a lot of it \u2013 a lot more of it will translate into next year. So, I think a larger component of the dug will be conversions. But it's \u2013 the latest data that I am seeing is probably 5 points, 4, 5, 6 points, I think it will be significantly more than that next year, just because the world sort of while conversions are obviously sort of in keeping with what's going on in the broader environment. We went through a period of time of 3 or 4 months where sort of nothing was getting done. Now, we are in lots of active discussions. Those deals need to be negotiated. In some cases, you need to do CapEx work, property improvement programs and get it into the system. And so some of that \u2013 a bunch of that's going to happen this year. As I said, we will have we will have meaningful incremental percentage this year, but I think a lot more just time wise by the time things get done, we will be into next year. And I do think the combination of that with the properties that were new construction that got delayed, because of the freezing of time during particularly most of the second quarter will mean next year will be a better NUG year. I don't think it will be back to where we were yet. I think it will take a couple of years to get back to where we were. But I just think the math, the math of how NUG is going to work is going to \u2013 is going to \u2013 it does strongly suggest that our 3.5% to 4% is sort of the low point in this cycle and then next year is better and then we are \u2013 then we are moving our way back to a more stabilized environment. I mean, what's interesting, you didn't ask it, but somebody will, we are still \u2013 there are few months that everybody is frozen, we are still signing a lot of deals and getting a lot of deals under construction. I mean, I wouldn't hold me to it, because data is not perfect these days, in the sense that it's hard to \u2013 hard to know exactly what people are going to do, but best \u2013 our best guess is that we will probably sign \u2013 our signings maybe down circa 20%. Our starts right now look like they are down circa 10% and then we already talked about NUG. So that's why the pipeline numbers are looking good as we are still signing lots of deals that we are eventually going to open and we are not opening them as fast. So the math becomes pretty, pretty simple to explain there. So, we are \u2013 I have been surprised honestly to the good on activity on the development side on all fronts. I have been surprised on how many deals were getting signed. I have been surprised to the good on how many are going under construction. And as I said, our NUG numbers are sort of inching up, which is a pleasant surprise. So, we are still \u2013 we are still working hard in the Country Garden deal, I think is a testament to the fact that like we are not crying in our milk. We got a business to run. We got great brands. This too shall pass. We will get back to a more normalized environment and we got to be forward \u2013 we people we have to deal with the current environment which I think we have quite well, but we also have to look forward, I think Country Garden, which was \u2013 which we are working on pre-COVID obviously if it got done is a testament to the fact that we are dealing with it here now and we are also dealing with the future all at the same time, which is what we get paid to do. Hey, Shaun. Good morning. Yes. I would say, our performance weighted for the industry is maybe a touch better when you adjust for the difference in methodology, which is that we are keeping all of our hotels, even the hotels that closed temporarily or are still closed in our comp set. If you \u2013 and star is not if you adjust for that and we are on top of \u2013 or a little bit better. I would say on the rate side of things, we have seen improvement basically for the quarter, at the beginning of the quarter, rate was down, of that like, April was almost 90% down in RevPAR, about 35% down in rate. If you look at July, that's 25% down. And if you look at where the trend line is going in August and beyond, it's coming down. I mean, I think the rate thing is a really \u2013 we have had a lot of discussion about it here, because lots of questions on is the industry going to maintain rate integrity and all that. I think, what is really behind the rate issue as we dig into the data and it doesn't take much digging, because there is not that much data these days or not as much as normal. It's really a mix issue, which is we have \u2013 the traditional customer of ours particularly has been a higher rated leisure and a higher rated business traveler. There is just not as many of them at the moment traveling for all the reasons that you guys know. And so it's a different sort of population, not entirely, but largely different than we are used to, which is much more not to be judgmental, but a much lower and lower price point customer and so the issue for all of us in the industry, I can't speak for what others have done that speak for us is we have owners that are really hurting and we are trying to do everything we can to help them, because no business is built for sort of what was happening, which is like the limited or no revenue and then very, very low levels of revenue and so in this very difficult time, along with our consultation with our owners, our view was, whatever business is out there to help them we need to go after it. And so what's happened is race have come down largely as a result, I'm not going to say there isn't great pressure broadly in an environment like this, everybody expects a bargain. So yes, there is rate pressure broadly, but if you look at the data, if you look at the math, the bulk of it is just mix We are now in this environment we have gone after directly some through the OTAs, but largely through our own through our own channels with honors, and all of our marketing campaigns and marketing spend, lower funnel has been going after that lower rated leisure traveler because it has been the bulk of what is out there to get and we need to we need to help our owners get to the other side of this. And so when you when you mix that in, it's just added, it starts even pre COVID at a much lower price point. And I think so I think that is what's going on with ADR. I think while there'll be pressure on ADR because of the economic issues that have been caused, as a result of COVID, and it would be silly to say there won't be I think you will get, I think that the pressures that you saw in the second quarter that are still ongoing, when you get back to the new level of what I will call a new normalized environment, where you have many more of our traditional travelers, higher end leisure and higher end business transients, travelers on the road again, I think this will, will write itself in quite rapidly. Yes, it's a good question. And I think I sort of touched on it, indirectly. Yes, in this environment, you just heard what I said about the biggest bucket of demand, which is lower price leisure demand that would typically favor OTAs. That is typically what we have used over time, the OTAs for to supplement the other pools of our demand that we have very direct access to. And so you would think this would mean that our distribution channel mix would be shifting in that way, but reality is it has not. Our direct channels in part because of what we have been doing, because we do want to continue to build direct relationships with customers of all sorts, including these customers who we hope may not have been our typical customer before, but we hope we will adopt our system during COVID and post-COVID and we will add to the complement of customers that we have. And so, the OTA business from a distribution point of view has held relatively constant. Our direct channels are growing at a faster pace. And that is, as I said \u2013 that is because of our actions, not so much and what we are doing and with the SAs, but very much how we are spending our marketing dollars and how we are orienting our Honors programs to access that type of customer. Thanks. Yes, I mean, it is a little early, Robin, but it's a really good question. And I would ask it to, with I think next quarter, we will have a heck of a lot more to say, because we will have had a lot more conversation, I would say. And I am going to, I'm going to put it into the three big buckets, okay, I think a third, a third, a third. And this is I am being more scientific than reality but sort of in my own head, that's how plays out a third of our, of our big corporate customers are super understanding of what's going on. And they are of the belief that whatever deal we had to just continue on, and, and there's want to be supportive in this environment. They probably, for a period of time, we are going to be traveling less, but they want to sort of continue on with the basic pricing parameters that they had, and they've signed up for that, I would say and again, I we are just more early in the season of this dialogue. So it could change, I would say a third of them don't know, okay, there's sort of like, gosh, I don't know what to do. This is a crazy world, I sort of hear what you are saying, maybe we should just keep going. But there is sort of contemplative, and then a third are saying, it's a really crazy world and, and we want we got to get a better deal. Okay, that's, we are suffering. If we are going to travel and we are going to stay with you we got to get a better deal. And I would say that's as much as I know, at the moment, I think in the end, that third that are in the middle, I think half of them go both ways. I think it's sort of 50-50 when I talked to our sales teams, and it's all anecdotal for the record, it's not like this is scientific data, but I'm talking to them all the time. every single week, at least once, they will say it's or like half of our big corporate customers get it, they want to be supportive, they that they are not going to beat us up in half are sort of like, nah, I, got to get a better deal because the world my world blew up too. So we will see how it plays out. As I said there will be an environment where you get through the health situation and you are in a economic downturn, there is going to be as there always is some pressures on rate people are going to expect a bargain for everything, most things that they are doing. I my own belief is that will not be intense pressure, certainly not reflective of what you are seeing in the current environment. As I said to an earlier question, much of the rate degradation, the bulk of the rate degradation, as far as I can tell at this point, is really just the mix. It's just a different customer base. There will be pressure, but not this kind of pressure on rates as you get to a more normalized environment. Yes, they are. Intentions keep picking up. I mean, you're right, I think all of \u2013 like what we are seeing broadly is, you know, a lot of it, we are doing some group by the way, in the second quarter, we did like 10% of our volume was group. I think it will be higher in the third and fourth quarter for what it's worth. So \u2013 but again, it's not our typical groups, it's like \u2013 it's groups related to the crisis, it's businesses in small group meetings where they just have to do it, but their offices aren't really open yet. I mean, they are \u2013 and we are getting a lot of that kind of stuff. But I mean, it's obviously a small fraction of what it typically would be. I do think it will keep picking up, because those sort of other types of groups are going to keep picking up as the year goes on, but the traditional bigger group meetings and all that, that are kind of a bread and butter in the fall, those are going to keep getting kicked out. A bunch of them are still on the books for the rest of year, but I think a lot of that will wash out. And as day by day you sort of see that washing out and people are kicking the can into next year with again the hopes that the health crisis be low will pass and/or through a vaccine, herd immunity, whatever is going to happen. And the further we go in the year the further they sort of kick it out, because there is a lot of noise in the system and it makes them nervous about wanting to spend a lot of time and money planning a meeting, they might have to \u2013 they might have to cancel. So, I would say, where it starts to stiffen up a bit is \u2013 starting in Q2 of next year. I think people \u2013 the psychology of it is for third and fourth quarter you will see groups, but it's sort of group meetings at a necessity or a replacement for something what happened into your office and that will pickup as time goes on. But the core sort of traditional group business is going to kick forward to Q2 through Q4 next year and we are both moving business that is cancelling, we are moving every bit we can and which is most of it to a future date. And we are booking new business. I mean, they are \u2013 we are booking tens of millions of dollars a week of new business for periods in the future, most of which is starting in the second quarter next year. So, a lot of it will \u2013 again, you get \u2013 it's like there is so many unknowns. You get a vaccine it changes the game on a lot of these things. Again, you still have the economic situation to deal with and people have still been damaged in that way. But I think it frees up a lot \u2013 it creates a decent amount of momentum, because the fear goes away. So I think we just have to see where all this \u2013 see where all of this goes through the fall. I mean, again, I feel pretty good about where things are going with vaccines. There certainly is a lot of data out there that says as you get to the later part of this year and early next, even if you don't have a vaccine, you are going to be at a point of herd immunity, because enough people are either naturally have the natural antibodies, T-cells and/or have been exposed in a way where it just can't spread the same way that it has. Again, I am not a health expert like you I read a lot of stuff. I think we just have to sort of get watch it really carefully in the fall. And on the current course, I think all segments will continue to grind up. Group will obviously be the longest last, because people require spending, planning and right now, most people don't want to do that. Alright, they just \u2013 they don't want to do that, because they are afraid they are wasting time and money. No, I don't have the data in front of me, but no, I don't think that's the case. And it's not yet. I think it could \u2013 it could eventually build to that. And if things go well, it will, I think, but not at the moment, no, we are not where we were. Well, I think that I didn't mean to ply anything on that, as far as I was concerned. And so if I if I did, what I meant, but in answer to that question, I would say, I mean, there's, that there is a raging debate about that, but I think will be ongoing over the next 3 years. My belief is from having done this for 37 years and while we have not had a pandemic like this, we have had lots of other things, lots of other similar things that have disrupted the environment that, in the short intermediate term, you are definitely going to have a substitution effect because people businesses have been damaged. And as a result, they are going to have to have find ways to cut costs and save money and so they are going to substitute zoom in for certain types of meetings, and it will they will have an impact in the short intermediate term. I think over the long term, there will be and by the way, as a result, we of course are looking as we are now at every opportunity of how we utilize our all of our rooms and all our public spaces and everything else in creative ways to be able to supplement and find different pockets of demand, whether that be leisure, whether that be using rooms as offices in an environment where people aren't, opening offices because we have a safe environment where people can be socially distanced by definition, etcetera. We are doing all those things. I personally believe when you wake up in two or three years, and you can, you can, we will all mark this moment and let's talk in three years, I think we will have a raging debate this business travel will never be the same. And it will look, it may look like that, because businesses have been hobbled a lot of them and it will be lower for a while, I have already said, I think it takes two or three years to get back. I think what we will find when we wake up in three years, it'll be more like it was in 18 and 19, than it is now. There will be a substitution effect. There will be different. There will be certain types of business travel that probably forever will change whoever said 10%, God bless them. I am not smart enough to figure that out. I have read a bunch of pundits have had views, I don't know. But at the same time, like every other time, there will be other things and other needs for travel that will emerge. And so I think while it will take a few years to get back, I think, one way or another we will have similar levels of demand, both for business transients and group people will want to congregate people will have to meet will have to build relationships, if anything that zoom in WebEx, I think has taught us it's really hard, to build a real relationship this way. So, maybe a bunch of internal meetings or whatever, there are some things I mean, that's all we are doing. There is some things that I think will be what percentage and I know will sort of become a more permanent way of doing things, but they will be they will be supplanted by other forms of travel where people are going to are going to be out traveling for things that that they haven't been traveling for. And so, short intermediate term, we absolutely have scrambled every jet we got to think about a weaker business transients demand environments to fill those gaps. We and I believe longer term it will recover to similar level. Well, I don't think so. I mean, the reality is in a big full service hotel, our revenue \u2013 our fees are generally based on both food and beverage and rooms and other revenues. So in the big complex hotels that already \u2013 we already do that in a limited service hotel, let's be honest, there is pretty much only rooms. So we don't have a lot of other infrastructure or capacity in the facility in most limited service, like a Hampton Inn, there isn't a lot of meeting space. By the way, that's part of room revenue in any event. There is a \u2013 it's a small lobby. It's a different animal. And so there really is rooms, it's in those hotels if you are \u2013 if you don't have your traditional customers it's what other ways can you sell rooms. Like I said, you could sell them as office space, you can do, there are things that you sell them as dormitories, which we are doing like crazy, right. We have done dozens and dozens of deals across the country with universities. We are doing all those things, but that \u2013 but all that flows through room revenues and I think the incentives are properly aligned already generally. Yes. Yes. I mean, we are right in the middle of that, Smedes. So, I don't really have an answer. Everything is on the table, first of all. I mean, we are \u2013 it's that along with literally hundreds of other things around the table. That's probably one of the bigger things. We have agreed already with our owners in the short to intermediate term to do that as part of our launch of clean stay, because we think it is a better protocol for cleanliness to not have third-parties in the room. And so we clean the room. We seal \u2013 literally put a seal on the door. And only if a customer requests it, so it's an opt in, do we have somebody come in and do a limited cleaning that obviously based on the fact that people have been not opting in at a high rate, that is helpful from a margin point of view. We also think it's helpful from a cleanliness point of view, which is why it was part of clean stay. What we are doing is using this moment, which at a minimum that will go through this year to figure out with our customers what they really want. I mean, what we are trying to do is thread the needle with our customer and our owner community to make sure that, what I said in my earlier comment that we are ultimately giving our customers what they want, so they will pay a big premium for our product. And we are doing in a way that drives the best margins humanly possible for our owners. And we have to satisfy both constituencies. And so what we are doing between now and the end of the year is looking at a lot of data, we are doing it, so we now have a real test that is system-wide that is live, that is allowing us to look at data to see the behavior of the consumer to talk to consumers about their views on this. And so it's definitely on the table, but we don't yet have enough data to have an answer and I think the idea is that we will through the rest of this year, be studying it and figure out based on that data what the right answer is. Thanks everybody for the time. Obviously, Q2, not a shining moment in our 100-year history, but I guess this is what happens when you have a global pandemic we found out. I have lived through a lots of different things over the years and this is certainly \u2013 has stressed the limits of I think what all of us have seen. But I am really, as I said in my comments, I am very proud of how we have responded. I mean, we have taken a difficult situation I think and are managing our way through it quite well. Our team has been working tirelessly, fewer of them working even harder. And I feel as good as I did pre-COVID about the long-term prospects for this business, it may not feel that way to you all right now, but I do think when we wake up in 2 or 3 years, we will be back on track and this business will be performing as will the industry quite well. We look forward to talking to you after Q3. Every quarter, we learn a lot. So I suspect we will have a little bit better visibility into the trajectory of recovery, maybe even have some knowledge on vaccines as all of us etcetera. So we will look forward to catching you up after Q3. Take care and be well."

Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think we can all agree and certainly probably have all been saying a lot lately, these are truly unprecedented times. COVID-19 has created challenges that our industry has never encountered before. On behalf of Hilton's entire leadership team, I'd like to express our deepest sympathies to those who have lost loved ones during this devastating pandemic. I'd also like to extend our sincere gratitude to the millions of workers on the frontlines across many industries and in many roles, working selflessly to help keep us all safe. I also want to thank our team members around the world for their remarkable dedication, hard work and sacrifice. Many of our own team members have been personally impacted by this crisis and yet, through this adversity, they've continued to spread the light and warmth of hospitality. Across every region, we've adapted quickly to provide hospitality in new ways in our communities.  In London, several of our properties are hosting the National Health Service and other key workers. The Hilton Orlando has been hosting the National Guard and working to distribute essential items to community residents in need and over 500 hotels around the world are being used for recovery efforts. Our properties have also donated thousands of pounds of food and supplies to local food banks. Through the Hilton Effect Foundation, we are providing disaster response grants for organizations and communities fighting the spread of COVID-19. As part of this effort, our Hilton Honors members have donated more than 6.5 million points to these causes.  In partnership with American Express and our ownership community, we committed to donating up to 1 million room nights to frontline medical professionals in the United States to support those who are putting their lives on the line to protect us. Since its launch just four weeks ago, tens of thousands medical professionals have booked hundreds of thousands of rooms through the program. Further building on this initiative, just this week, we and American Express announced a partnership with World Central Kitchen to deliver freshly prepared meals at no charge from restaurants and local communities to frontline responders staying at our hotels. Already active in three major markets, there are plans to expand this initiative in the coming weeks.  Turning to the business, to ensure we effectively navigate this challenging time, we've focused our priorities on three core areas: protect our people; protect our core business; and prepare for recovery. While our long-term goal remains the same to drive loyalty across all of our stakeholders, the current situation requires greater levels of responsiveness and preparedness in the near term. With this in mind, we've worked closely with industry association and the administration to advocate on behalf of our team members and hotel owners, and to help shape the broader recovery. Given our leadership team\u2019s extensive crisis management experience, coupled with the global nature of our business, we had a relatively early glimpse of the impact this pandemic started to have in the Asia Pacific region. In response, we took swift action to protect our business and ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to operate in these unprecedented times.  With travel demand at record lows, we currently have suspended operations at approximately 950 or 16% of our hotels globally, including approximately 10% of our hotels in the Americas, 60% of our hotels in Europe, the Middle East in Africa, and 15% of our hotels in Asia Pacific. At the hotel level, we acted quickly at the beginning of the crisis, to make decisions to help our owners respond, including suspending hotel operations, temporarily suspending brand and operating standards, deferring capital expenditure requirements, eliminating quality assurance audits and allowing the use of FF&E reserves for operating expenses. Going forward, we are working closely with our ownership community to define the hotel operating model of the future with a goal of developing operating standards that will keep our customers safe and drive enhanced efficiency and profitability, while continuing to deliver products and service that customers will pay a premium for. At the corporate level, we've reduced executive salaries, furloughed nearly two-thirds of our corporate workforce, eliminated other non-essential expenses, including capital expenditures and suspended share buybacks and dividends. Further, as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility, we drew down on the remaining amount under our credit facility, pre-sold Hilton Honors points to American Express and successfully executed a bond offering, all of which resulted in a pro forma cash position of $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which we believe has more than adequate liquidity to get us through the crisis. Turning to the quarter RevPAR declined 23% with performance through February, largely in line with our expectations excluding the Asia Pacific region. RevPAR in March dropped 57%, as the virus spread across Europe and the U.S. Overall, we do not think our first quarter results provide clear insight into the current environment, as the timing of the pandemic and we -- given the timing of the pandemic and we expect a much more dramatic impact on our second quarter results. With travel at a virtual standstill, we expect system-wide RevPAR declined roughly 90% in April.  With that being said, we are starting to see glimmers of travel resuming and economies reopening. In China, nearly all 150 hotels that have been closed due to the pandemic have since reopened with occupancies reaching more than 50% during the May Day holiday this past weekend, up significantly from 9% in early February. Additionally, the majority of our previously halted construction projects in China have restarted. In the U.S. and Europe, we're starting to see sensible and staged re-openings of economies. We think temporary hotel suspensions have plateaued and we are now seeing reopening requests. Our sales teams are engaged with customers on business for the back half of the year and into 2021 and beyond. In the last week alone, we booked tens of billions of dollars in Group business in the Americas.  In addition, we are starting to see double-digit increases in digital traffic and booking activity across all segments. Global occupancy levels have gone from a low point of 13% to 23% currently. Assuming we start to see mobility and we don't have a significant recurrence, demand should slowly rebuild in the third quarter. These green shoots allow us to keep our eye on what the future of hospitality may look like. As we carefully consider what travelers needs will be in a post-COVID-19 world, we are proud to announce a partnership with Lysol and the Mayo Clinic last week to introduce Hilton CleanStay, a new program that will deliver an industry-defining standard of cleanliness at all of our properties around the world. We believe this program is the first of many steps we can take to build on the trust and loyalty of our more than 106 million Hilton Honors members as they begin to travel again. A full recovery will take time, and it could take several years to return to the hotel demand levels we experienced in 2019. But as we shift our focus to the future, we are incredibly confident about the long-term prospects of the business and our model. Our industry leading brands, powerful commercial engines, and innovative technology platforms should enable us to continue delivering incremental value to guests, owners and shareholders for years to come.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for details on the first quarter.\nKevin Jacobs : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter system-wide RevPAR declined 23% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. RevPAR was down across all regions with the weakest results in Asia Pacific. Decreases were primarily driven by occupancy declines with rate pressure from the lower rated business further impacting results. Adjusted EBITDA was $363 million in the first quarter declining 27% year-over-year. Results reflect significant reductions in travel demand and the temporary suspension of operations in a number of hotels across the world. While the decline was somewhat mitigated by greater cost control, more significant measures were largely implemented after quarter end. Management and franchise fees decreased 18% to $422 million driven by RevPAR declines and roughly flat license fees.  Given the extremely challenging operating environment, which included the suspension of operations at 35 of our leased hotels during the quarter, our ownership segment posted a loss due to higher levels of operating leverage and fixed rent structures at some of our leased properties.  Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.74. During the quarter, we opened nearly 9,000 rooms meaningfully lower than prior expectations due to postponed openings driven by COVID-19. Approvals and construction starts increased ahead of our expectations, largely due to the signing of our largest development deal to-date, and agreement with Resorts World for a 3500 room tri-branded hotel resort on the Las Vegas Strip. Much like the rest of our business, development activity for the balance of the year will depend on a number of factors. However, we do expect that our ultimate rate of net unit growth for the year will be significantly lower than our pre-crisis expectations, likely around half the rate or a bit better.  Turning to liquidity, as Chris mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to enhance our position and increase our financial flexibility, including executing on the bond transaction that Chris referenced earlier. We were very pleased with the outcome of that transaction through which we issued two $500 million tranches of senior notes at pricing that was very attractive relative to other transactions executed in the same timeframe. At the time, it also marked the first eight year high yield financing done since the crisis, which allowed us to continue to enhance our maturity schedule. We continue to have no debt maturities prior to 2024 and a well-staggered maturity ladder thereafter. Factoring for the senior note issuance as well as the $1 billion Hilton Honors points presale, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion on a pro forma basis, which we think should provide us with ample liquidity to navigate the current environment and prepare for recovery. Further details on our first quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.  This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. Jamie, can we have our first question please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Joe Greff from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nJoe Greff: I was hoping to get a better understanding of your operating sensitivities in this environment. And as we kind of look at these -- unbelievable to me to be talking about the magnitude of these RevPAR declines. But given these pretty steep RevPAR declines, how do you see the relationship to base and franchise fees? How do you see that relationship, which I can guess on the incentive management fee side? How are you thinking about your run rate G&A from here? And if you can give us some sort of -- some points on understanding the components of your monthly cash burn, I think that would be helpful to us?\nChris Nassetta: Wow! That's about 20 questions in there, Joe. Good job.\nJoe Greff: Don't ask me to repeat it. I can't remember all of the questions.\nChris Nassetta: I can't either. Yes. We can't, as we said, we're not giving guidance. So we'll answer what we can but happy to talk about the sensitivities at a high level. I would say, as we look at the, what I think would be helpful sort of RevPAR to EBITDA relationship, the way I would think about it in terms of sensitivities and there's thousands of assumptions as you would guess that go into this is, if you have RevPAR declines -- and we're not giving guidance, so we're not going to suggest what we think they are for the year and you guys have views, I would say the model is such that up to around 30% RevPAR declines, the whole company RevPAR to EBITDA is a bit better than 1-to-1 and when it goes over 30%, it's a bit worse than 1-to-1 but not materially so. The base fee business throughout that continuum is better than 1-to-1 and what obviously hurts as the higher you go is a certain level of negative operating leverage because no matter how much you cut corporate costs, which we've done a lot of, there's a limit to how far you can go and keep the system going. And then in real estate, the lower the RevPAR is given that these are leased assets with some degree of fixed rent structure, that creates a tailwind. But again, that's a very small part of the business overall and has been. So, it keeps us even -- I've seen the industry sort of numbers I've seen from a bunch of folks I think including you are sort of minus 50 for the year, sort of funny to hear myself say that. But if you're doing this for 35 plus years, that's what the industry thinks. I think, as I said, our ratio, EBITDA -- overall ratio would be a little bit -- a touch above 1-to-1. The base fee business would be better even at those levels. On G&A -- on sort of the G&A as we see it on a GAAP basis, I think given the mitigation that we have done with an assumption that as you get into the third and fourth quarter, you will have some sort of -- you will start to see recovery. I mean, the truth is, while it's slow, we're starting to see it now. We've gone from 13% to 23% already, not a lot to be thankful for, but we do believe once you get through the epicenter of the crisis, which it feels like from a health point of view, we are. And you get into reopening parts of the world that haven't reopened, including United States, you'll start to improve in the third and in fourth quarter. I think when you net all that out, probably G&A is 25% to 30% lower. Remembering for us, and it's a point worth making, our G&A for the last three years has basically been flat. We are we believe always very disciplined about our G&A. And coming into the year we were actually guiding before pre-COVID-19 to a modest decline in G&A. Obviously, that decline, given the mitigation that that we have gone through to sort of right size the business for the operating environment will be much greater than what we would have suggested pre-COVID-19, but sort of in the ranges that I talked about.  On cash burn, and we have already as part of the bond deal and otherwise put out public information on that, I think the way to think about it is in the environment, we're sort of in the second quarter, which I said, I don't believe we will maintain that level of performance, and I think the third quarter will be the worst of it, even at those levels that are sort of circa 80% to 90% off. We think we have at least 24 months of liquidity. And if you take sort of industry, the industry view that I'm seeing broadly that I discussed earlier, actually, is that at that level of performance, we are better than cash flow positive. So, that hopefully gives you sort of a bit of a range, again recognizing we're not giving specific guidance but just trying to give you a general trajectory. Kevin, what did I miss out of his laundry list? \nKevin Jacobs: I think you covered most of it. I think overall embedded in that cash burn -- those cash burn guidance is obviously an assumption of pretty extensive mitigation on our gross controllable expenses outside of G&A. And I'd say on an overall basis, we think we can over the course of the year mitigate about 60% of the gross controllable expenses, but that's all embedded in the cash burn assumption. I think you actually said the third quarter was going to be the worst, but we think the second quarter \u2026.\nChris Nassetta : Second quarter. I did say that?\nKevin Jacobs : Yes, second quarter. I've already skipped the quarter. Yes, second quarter recovery to a degree. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. \nCarlo Santarelli : Kevin, acknowledging that, that you mentioned kind of NUG, half of the 6 to 7 you were prior -- you were previously looking for, for this year. How much of that call it 300 basis points to 350 basis points of NUG erosion for this year relates to just delays in the pipeline that we will see come through presumably next year. And how much of that is just stuff that that maybe was early and has a lower likelihood at this point of getting finished? So, more or less even if you want to take a bigger picture approach, when you think about the opportunities for conversions and whatnot, looking out to \u201821, \u201822, \u201823 etcetera, are you still reasonably comfortable in kind of a mid single-digit net unit growth baseline for those years? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, so here's what I would say, Carlo, and obviously a good question. Virtually all of the decline in our outlook for NUG for this year is due to delays related to COVID-19. Meaning, we do have in our guidance is always an embedded assumption for conversions. And I'll come back to that, I know that's part of your question. But the decline is really entirely related to delays because going into the year, even for a limited service hotel, if something is expected to open this year, it's going to be under construction this year, right? So, as of -- about a third of the hotels that we had under construction that we expected to open this year, went into some form of suspension over the last month or so as part of the crisis. About half of those that went under suspension are already back under construction, but they're going to be somewhat delayed, right, obviously, because they suspended. And about half of them, the other half we think will resume construction, largely every project we think will resume construction over the balance of year. There certainly will be onesies, twosies of things where a deal might not make sense. But generally, once the hotel starts construction, it opens, right? And so, what that means is almost all of it will push into next year.  So as a result, we think that whatever this year ends up being will be the bottom and that will climb back from there. And yes, on a run rate basis, once we get back to normal, we're more than comfortable with a mid single-digit NUG growth rate. And we think that conversions, there will be some period of time where, obviously at the moment -- although we are working on some conversions as we speak, we're working on a bunch of them actually, but at the moment transaction activity is relatively limited. But in general, we think the crisis will probably create more opportunities than it hurts. And so, hopefully that covers.\nCarlo Santarelli : Yes. That did, Kevin, thank you very much. And then if I could just one quick follow up. When you guys think about the financial crisis and the resumption, obviously it was different circumstances and whatnot, but speaking specifically to the Group elements of the business, when you think about the recovery in that era, on the Group side relative to now, and based on obviously the positive traction you guys have had with re-bookings and some sales progress on future periods, et cetera, what are you hearing or what do you view as being kind of the key differentiators between that Group recovery and getting kind of adequate pricing back on the books, et cetera in this period relative to that period?\nChris Nassetta: Well, there are going to be a lot of similarities, Carlo, and then some differences as you might guess. I mean, I think that the economic fallout we'll see -- I mean, I think the economic fallout here is likely to be greater. And then you put on top of that a mobility issue and a health and hygiene issue, which is people not wanting to for a period of time until maybe there's a vaccine or therapeutics or we get past this, not wanting to congregate in large groups. So, I think being pragmatic about it, and just straight forward about it, I think Group always is the last to recover. In the 30 whatever years I've been doing this and going through these ups and downs, Group is the last recovers for no other reason that it's longer lead business, right? So, it's sort of logical. I think here it will be a little longer than normal because of those factors. I think the economic impact is going to be greater than most of what we've seen in my time, and we have to get -- people are going to have to sort of not only just come out of their foxholes, but ultimately get comfortable congregating again. All of that I think will happen. By the way, I think the business, when you get two or three years out, will look a lot more like it did 90 days ago than it looks right now. I think it will look very, very similar to it. But I think, it's going to take time and progression. It's going to depend on what happens with reopening. It's going to depend on what happens with how we fight COVID-19. It's going to depend on things that are unknowns today, which is where we end up with vaccines and therapeutics. I'm super optimistic based on the people I'm talking to about those things. But I'm not a health expert and I'm not in the pharma business and I don't know. But those things are all sort of variables that it is just too early to judge.  So, I think, the simple answer would be -- I think, what would the contours of this recovery, like prior recoveries to a degree, with a little bit of nuance will be leisure transient first, business transient second, and group third. I think they're all going to be a little bit different in contours than prior cycles for obvious reasons of the impact of COVID-19 being different in terms of the impact that it has on people and business. But I think that, that is the progression. And while you didn't ask it, I'll say it, I do think as we get in \u2013 correcting -- thank you for correcting me, Kevin, I do think Q2 is going to be very bad because we know that. I do think you will start as we get reopening around the world and America is moving again, if the government and the state -- federal government and state governments are responsible, I've been on the council for reopening and so I think there's a sensible dialogue going on there. You will start to see a recovery in as you get into Q3 in my opinion in Q4, I think that the initial stages of that just given how very low Q2 is, will look like a pretty decent snapback but trying to -- but I don't want to be pollyannaish. Getting back to sort of the levels of occupancy, like for us that were in the low to -- low mid 70s in 2019, which were all time highs, that's going to take time. I think you will see the down, you'll see a bit of a snapback as you get mobility off of a very low levels and then I think you're going to sort of slowly recover, as people get more comfort and businesses start to get back in business, start to think about hiring and investing and all those kind of things. And that, as I said in my prepared comments that's going to take two or three years to get back in my opinion to those levels and that's the -- my honest view. The truth is, this thing is moving really fast. So -- and there are a lot of unknowns, as I just said. So, that's my view, based on what I see and I've seen a lot and talked to a lot of people, but time will tell, which is exactly why we haven't given guidance because it's just too early to know. But everybody on this call knows I'm a born optimist, and that will never change. So, I feel spectacularly good about the long-term for the industry. I feel spectacularly good about our model and the long-term opportunities for Hilton and we just sort of have to go through a period of time to rebuild and get back on our feet as an industry and a company to get back to where we were.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Harry Curtis from Instinet. Please go ahead with your question.\nHarry Curtis : Hi, Chris. Given your vast experience through prior recessions, let's go back to 2008 and \u201809 where there was a significant amount of handwringing about the impact of video conferencing on corporate travel. And it didn't really pan out. Do you think it pans out in the recovery and I know it's anybody's guess, but is it different this time do you think?\nChris Nassetta: I mean, it's anybody's guess. I mean, certainly I've done more WebEx meetings and Zoom than I ever want to do in my life. I don't know about all of you. Maybe it's [indiscernible] -- I'm tired of it. The last thing I'm going to want to do when I get done with this is do another video conference and I'm by the way hearing that from a lot of people. So, the honest answer is, I don't know. I would say, on the margin, yes, there's going to be certain trip occasions where maybe because people have become more accustomed to this out of necessity to sort of be able to function that they'll think, well, I can do that. I don't have to do a trip. But I think much like the debates that I've been part of for the last 20 or 30 years is has evolved, I think it is an unstoppable force that people want to travel and see each other and meet to, to build relationships, whether that is personal or related to business. I don't think that will change. I don't think globalization is going to stop. I don't think the need for people to travel the world is going to stop. And I am highly confident we can all wake up in two or three years -- and you can tell me I was right or wrong, but I am highly confident and as I said, when you wake up at two or three years, the world's going to -- it's hard to see it now, the world is going to look awful a lot like it did 90 days ago in terms of customer behavior and demand patterns, and alike. There will be some differences. As I said, maybe on the margin, there's some business transient where people do it, but I think they're going to want to see people. They're going to be other things that happened, that changed, but it's going to be things I think that were sort of forming where it will accelerate other things, like our digital key, digital check-in which we've had great adoption. I think we'll have massive adoption. Connected room, where you get in a room, you don't have to mess with the remote control or touch switches. I think people will sort of adopt those things.  So, I think, the digital world was already very important to us. I think it's going to get more important because some of those trends are going to be accelerated. But I do not -- I wake up at night, thinking about a lot of things these days. I do sleep, but I get up awfully early as I told Kevin. But I do not worry that people are not going to want to see each other, meet with each other and ultimately congregate. I think that is the human condition, and I think there is an argument that on the margin I described, it could take some trip occasions. There's also, I think an even better argument that people are going to want to see people more than ever. They just need to feel safe, right? And I think when they feel safe, they will go back largely to their own patterns and behaviors. Looking at the great -- looking at prior activities, I think 9/11 is probably the most instructive, while it's not the same, because none of this is unprecedented as we keep saying, there's some lessons that were learned there. Like, basically everybody said, well, after 9/11, nobody traveled, they did. Video conferencing wasn't as good, but they figured out other ways to do things, because they were afraid to get on planes and travel and go out. You're fast forward, two or three years, we had figured out how to manage the world and figured out how to not get rid of terrorism but manage it. And people went back largely to their prior behaviors with it. It did accelerate a few things that were not, frankly I would argue, harmful that were probably helpful. I think, the same thing is going to happen here. I think as we get through this and we realize that COVID-19 and these types of viruses are a part of our future, they have been, we have dealt with the seasonal flu. There was a time where dealing with the seasonal flu felt like this. That we will figure out as a global community how to deal with this. We will hopefully have a vaccine. Time will tell. We will certainly have more therapeutics. We will certainly have better practices and procedures to make sure that we protect the very small part of the global population that is really, truly most impacted by this. And I think as people then start to feel like this is a safe environment, they are going to go back largely to their old behaviors, I would bet a lot of money on it. And that's what history would tell you.\nHarry Curtis: And as a quick follow up, what are your peers in the airline industry telling you about the pace of their restart?\nChris Nassetta: I would say I have been talking to a lot of my peers, but looking at the data, to be honest, I thought at least in the last couple weeks, and in these days it's like every week makes a difference. But based on the conversations I have had over the last couple -- over the last month or two and then just looking at the data, I think while we're not in some -- let's be clear we're not showing robust recovery trends right now, I said we are like teeny type in China we are, but the rest of the world, it's like teeny tiny step forward. I think the airlines are way behind. And if you just look at the passenger mile data, how many enplanements, they're just way behind and here's the thing. That's because people are real -- those that are willing to travel are only willing to go so far from home. So, as I think about our team, you didn't ask, but I'll answer because we're spending an immense amount of time on recovery. I spent -- I had all 500 of our commercial leaders around the world on a Zoom call yesterday and talking about how we're retooling our approach to go to market over the next 6, 12, whatever it takes, 18 months, and that is going to be really much more about local business and a lot more in the beginning about drive to business, right?  So, if you if you think about it, I mean, sort of the natural human reaction is like I'm going -- I want to move, I want to get out, I'm starting to feel safe, I'm going to get out of my house, I'm going to go to my neighborhood, maybe I'll sort of move around the region, maybe I'll go to the region next door, eventually I'm going across the country, I'm going to get on a plane go around the world, but I think it's in that progression. So, if you think about it that way, while we've seen a little bit of pickup, I would argue, almost all of it has been in drive-to. And we -- thankfully, we have a big portfolio, a lot of brands, we have a lot of drive, we have in the world 2,600 or 2,700 Hampton Inns. And we have thousands, I think limited service hotels in the U.S., we have almost 4.000 of them and they are very well set up for that sort of local street corner type business and drive-to business.  So, I think there's a little bit of a disconnect, and there will be for a period of time where I think we will likely show I think recovery at a faster pace because we can accommodate types of demand that don't require travel. Ultimately, we need airlines. We need people to get on planes to get to the nirvana, which is back to more normal patterns of demand. Obviously, that has to happen. But in the short-term, I think it's going to be a little bit more local or little a bit more drive-to and in our industry, if you can accommodate that business it\u2019s going to be ahead of you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nShaun Kelley: So, Chris, I wanted to switch the subject a little bit to kind of the franchisee side of the world here. I was just wondering if you'd give us a little bit more color on how some of those conversations are going with your franchise partners. If it's possible, and I appreciate it's both early stage and it may be hard to give these numbers, but any sort of sense of magnitude of either asks of how many of your franchisees are looking for any form of fee relief or what that dialogue is kind of looking like right now?\nChris Nassetta: Sure. So this is something I commented on for a good reason in my prepared comments as we're spending as you would guess a huge amount of time with our franchise and broader ownership community because they are the engine of our growth and they are our most important partners in business. And times are difficult for everybody, but times are more difficult for them given the situation, which is no -- essentially no demand or very little demand yet, even with furloughs and all those things, they still have to pay debt service. They still have to pay for insurance and real estate taxes and utilities and all that kind of stuff. So, we've had a multi-tiered approach. I'd say, first and foremost, and I talked about it a little bit, a very little bit. We and I have been deeply involved in what's been going on with the Federal Government, both with the administration and on the hill to try and get liquidity relief for the industry, which is our ownership community, and frankly trying to get relief for our frontline team members that have been furloughed and not in any way relief for Hilton. We don't need it. We have not asked for it in any way, shape or form. But we have been pushing really hard with the administration, treasury. I've had lots of conversations with all the right people, including the President, Secretary Mnuchin throughout the PPP. Reality is, I could go on a long time, you don't want me to. PPP is a really good program and Congress and the administration should be given a lot of credit for moving that fast and getting that much money into the system that will help owners and small business folks. And ultimately employees keep -- stay on the payroll. Reality is, for our industry, it hasn't been as -- just because of the complexity of ownership structures and alike, it has not been that helpful. The second wave hopefully is more helpful. But the fed getting ready to launch a Main Street Lending Program, which we're working very hard on to make sure that there is more access. And so, a bunch of our owners by the way, lots and lots, dozens and dozens have had access to PPP. We're hoping that a much larger set of them get access to Main Street Lending Program. And so, that is an important part of what we're doing because they need a bridge, right? I mean ultimately we're also working with the administration on stimulus for the industry when we get the other side to get demand going and people reemploy but right now our owners need a bridge. So, we've been working very hard in that regard.  We also, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, have done tons of things in terms of by the way suspending operations at 950 hotels. We've never done that, right? In the 100 years we've been around, other than closing a hotel to tear it down or whatever, we've never done that. We've suspended massive amounts of our brand standards, operating standards, capital programs and a whole bunch of other things to sort of really give them huge flexibility in how they operate, which I think they have appreciated. As I also mentioned, one of the most important things that we're doing right now which I'm spending and our team is spending an immense amount of time on, which I mentioned very lightly is the hotel operating model of the future. We're working with all of our owners, franchisees across every brand, every category to figure out -- we've already done the short-term, but intermediate and long term. How do we use this time -- necessity, as I like to say, does become the mother of invention. To think about things that we've been exploring or thinking about -- and that we think makes sense to create more efficiency, what better time to sort of think about our standards and sort of put them all in the bucket and really put a bright light on them. And so we're doing that with deep involvement of our owner advisory councils. We kicked this off a couple weeks ago and we're in full swing and that's incredibly important work as we again get to the other side and hopefully get stimulus from the government, which I think we will, and that we create an opportunity in the intermediate term for them to be able to operate at lower demand levels and still have profitability and in longer term, as we get back to normal have even greater levels of profitability than when we went into it.  In terms of fee relief, I would say you wouldn't be surprised to hear that there have been owners that have asked for fee relief. But not -- hand over fist and the reality is, I think there's a real simple reason, our fee structure as you know which is different for different players in the industry, all of our fee structures, whether it's the franchise fee or management fee or the system charges, they're all based on a percentage of revenue. So, we have given the ultimate fee relief, meaning when you're 90% off, there really aren't many fees because there's not much revenue. And so I think most of the owners -- everybody would like every bit of help that they can get. I think most of the owners that I have talked to sort of understand that the fees have been right sized with the demand in the business that they're not at the moment sadly for us and sadly for them, they're not paying us a lot of fees in any event, so that we will continue to look at all options with our community. As we said there is no more important partner and stakeholder that we have. They are the engine of opportunity for us. They're investing all the capital they have been and I believe they will -- as Kevin noted with the pipeline and NUG numbers, they will continue to do so.  And so we are literally in personally I'm in daily conversations with huge numbers of them. And I think you can ask them yourself, and while we're never going to be perfect, so far the feedback I get from our owner community and you can validate it, is very high marks. That we were there earlier than most understanding the severity of this. We took very decisive and bold actions to provide relief early. And again, while we're not perfect my impression in the owners and I'm talking to hundreds of them is while they're hurting, they are certainly appreciating the partnership that we have provided.\nShaun Kelley : And then maybe a little bit more of a specific one for Kevin, I guess. Kevin could you outline for us a little bit more on maybe just this kind of point in time working capital drag that we could potentially see as it relates to mismatching on reimbursed costs. Primarily I think it's the system fund but anything else that maybe investors should be aware of just given the situation we're in when the music stops and drops as much as it is, kind of where cash could be trapped for a period of time and then how you expect to recover that down the road?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. Obviously, it's a question that's on a lot of people's minds. So, it's a good one. I think to take a step back if you think about, there's really three buckets of receivables that we have, right? In hotels that we manage which is a minority of the system, right, roughly 70% of the system is franchised. But in hotels that we manage, the owners are responsible for the working capital and all the obligations and some of those ultimately are paid by us and then reimbursed by owners. So there's an opportunity there. Then you have license fees and then system charges as Chris mentioned in his buildup. So those are the three primary buckets.  What I would say in terms of sizing it, first of all, it's really early, right? So if you think about the crisis really starting in March, you don't even build these things until the following month and then you give people 30 days to pay. And so, we're sort of just getting into it. So anything we would say there would be speculative. But that said, embedded -- I think it's probably obvious, but we're saying embedded in the discussion that we've given you both publicly and in some of Chris' commentary earlier is, a working capital of drag, whereas we've said if things stay the way they are, meaning circa 90% down in revenue and in this environment, we have at least 24 months of liquidity and you've got our cash balance. And so, you can sort of just do the math and realize that if things stay the way they are, there is an embedded cash drag in there that could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars ultimately. And so -- but of course, it depends on duration of the cycle, how it plays out? And ultimately, we believe as Chris just got done explaining that, the business is healthy. It's going to come back and when it comes back, we think we're going to get paid.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nAnthony Powell: So, longer term, how do you think this event changes the financing market for new hotel construction? Do you think lenders may require higher equity contributions or higher cash reserves? And could it be a headwind for construction and your net unit growth over the medium to longer term?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. That's a good question, Anthony. And the reality is, we don't really know. But what I think is that, generally when you come out of these crises, lenders get appropriately more cautious. Although I would say that, even pre-COVID, we were pretty deep into an economic cycle. And so, you were starting to see caution. That said, over the long-term, I would say, for construction, most of the hotels that get built in our system are not actually even financed aggressively. When you're talking about like big full service hotels and luxury hotels, sometimes they use more leverage, but the lion's share of the hotels that get built in our system are not actually financed all that aggressively. You're talking about like 50% loan to cost. And I would say, personally I think that when the business recovers, the lending community will be there and as long as hotels are productive and profitable investments that they'll be able to be financed. And then I think the last thing I'd add is, you have to remember the amount of liquidity that is in the system. Pre-COVID you're talking about like tripling plus of the money supply from quantitative easing and then even more capital being injected into systems globally. There's going to be plenty of capital looking for productive yields. And I would say, for some period of time it will be a distressed environment and then as it always does, it will recover back to normal.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. And then just one more. You mentioned that you\u2019ve relaxed brand standards across the board which helped owners. How do you manage that with customer expectations as you start to see recovery? Hilton Honors has been known for a very consistent experience across the board, customers are going to be returning to see no breakfast buffets or whatnot. How do you manage that going forward?\nChris Nassetta: It's a really good question. I think in the short-term, as we've been talking to customers and serving customers, everybody gets what's going on in the world. So, they're incredibly lenient. And so, we have not serving sadly, that many customers but those that we are -- who are mostly on the frontlines of recovery efforts have been fine with all of the standard changes in suspension of certain elements of the service. The work that I described that we're doing is sort of in the intermediate and long-term in making sure that we; one, create the most efficient operating model; and two, obviously, continue as implied to your question to drive premium market share. I mean, we're not -- we continue to have the premium market share in the industry, we have no plans to give that up. The trick is, as we transition from the intermediate to the longer term, what are the things that you basically put back into the standards and what do you take -- what do you leave out and/or change. And that's sort of I can't give you the answer and not because I don't want to, I don't have it yet. I mean, that's the work that we are doing right now. I suspect that what we will do is test a whole bunch of different things. I know we will, as well others during the intermediate timeframe when customers are very forgiving, and what we're going to do is iterate, with the objective of making sure that we are delivering premium product and service always to get our market share premium, but we want to drive efficiency. So, short-term is easy, intermediate term, I think will be a significant opportunity for testing when you're still in a relatively low demand environment where customers are still quite sort of accepting of things that are different. And then I think what we learn in that intermediate timeframe, we will sort of institute as our longer range standards and we're working through all of that.  I think there'll be a whole bunch of things that we'll do that'll be more efficient long-term, and they're going to be some that we're going to have some standards that we are going to -- that our customers are going to want in a more normalized environment and we're going to reinstitute. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question?\nStephen Grambling : Two related follow ups. First, on the working capital drag you cited in the hundreds of millions of dollars potentially. You mentioned, it depends on how long this will last. So, on the cash burn and monthly liquidity you provided in the debt deal, I think you were assuming that this is -- or maybe you can elaborate on whether you're assuming this is a consistent drag each quarter or if that would potentially moderate even if things remain weak? And then second, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from consumers as it relates to the loyalty program. You have some of the partnerships you have and how that may impact the model both during this period and then also how you ensure customer engagement to position yourself to use this asset and take share in eventual recovery?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, so on the working capital, Stephen, I would say, look the assumptions that we gave publicly which again just to make sure everything -- everyone's clear as part of the bond deal, we said 18 to 24 months, that was pre-money for the bond deal and we ended up upsizing that deal. So, that's sort of how you get to the longer end of that range. I would say that. Again when the crisis is new, things are a little sharper. So, I would -- the way I'd characterize it is, the first month, second quarter of this year probably would be the worst on that front and then it would moderate from there. But again, the assumption....\nStephen Grambling: The assumption to get to the 24 months -- or at least 24 months are basically you have little or no \u2026.\nChris Nassetta: Yes, you stay that way. \nKevin Jacobs: And from that perspective, again, I said it would be a little bit harsher at the beginning and then it would be relatively flat again in that under those assumptions, with any kind of recovery curve, it gets better from there.\nStephen Grambling : And then on the loyalty program side just any color you can provide on that?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. We have done a bunch of things if you look at it I'd say. First of all, not that we have a lot of business, but our Honors occupancy with the modest business we have has skyrocketed. So, it was already very high and now it's a lot higher because seemingly they are more willing to travel than I guess non-Honors members. But, what we've been focused on during this timeframe and you can see it in a lot of the things I talked about and that you would see publicly is, people aren't traveling that much. So, what can we do to build loyalty? We can give them flexibility, so we -- in the industry, we were the first ones, I believe. Certainly we were very early to come out and give very significant cancellation flexibility. We were definitely the first to come out and give status, allow people to remain -- keep their status. We were definitely the first to come out and say, we weren't going to -- we are not going to have points expire. We did a bunch of things to say to our Honors members, no fault of your own, you can't travel and we're not going to hold that against you. We've been communicating with them regularly. And so far, I'd say that's going well. The work that we're doing in the community, we're doing that because we want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. So, our 1 million room nights with AMEX to first responders for free, our World Central Kitchen work, all of the other work that we're doing is about sort of continuing to build our brand, the Honors brand with consumers who are sitting around and can't move but are watching a lot of TV and reading a lot, doing a lot of social media and they're seeing these things. The net result is, in terms of our numbers, our marketing team has been looking at it, like intent to consider purchase of our product, Net Promoter Score, whatever, those numbers have gone way up through the crisis. As a result, people realizing, we're doing the right things. And so, my attitude, which is the way I think about life, when you go into this, just like the way I thought about it when we went into the great recession, which was different. But similar is, when everything is good, it's really hard to differentiate yourself. I mean, I think we have -- I think we've done a great job, but you get caught up in an arms race. When everything is bad, people peel off and go different directions and you have a real opportunity to differentiate yourself. And so, what I said from the day we got in this crisis is, as much as we need to solidify the core and deal with liquidity with Kevin and the team have done an amazing job on and protects -- and deal with the cost structure and all the things, we have been crazy focused on making sure we are listening to customers, particularly Honors members and doing the right thing for them, that we are crazy focused on our owners, as I've already talked a lot about to do everything we can for them, that we're crazy involved in our communities so that people remember that, because we\u2019re part of the solution because that will continue to build loyalty. And obviously as impactful as it has been to our team members that as we're impacting them, we're doing it in the right way, in a way that is really taking care of them as best we can. And so, my attitude is, well, this is all painful, there's no other way to describe it. What we do now, will determine our future, and we are absolutely committed as a team and a company to continue to differentiate ourselves with all of our stakeholders and to come out the other side of this stronger, including with our Honors members. And so far, we\u2019re I think doing a very good job doing that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. \nBill Crow : Based on your discussion, I think it was with Harry earlier. It sounds like your view is that the primary gating factor for travel is not the hotel, it\u2019s the airplane -- airline. And if that's the case, is it fair to suggest that no matter how much they discount fares, it's probably not going to be as stimulative as it would have been in prior downturns. And then the second part of that is, does that also mean that the larger coastal gateway and markets come back far later than the rest of the country?\nChris Nassetta: Well, to a degree yes, but let me let me reframe it a little bit. What I was saying which is right. To get back to full recovery, I think the airlines are a gating issue. People have to be comfortable to get on planes, planes have to be flying, there's a bunch of the business particularly in the big -- in the major markets that are -- that is flied to. And so to get to full recovery you have to have that. I absolutely believe you can get a significant amount of recovery before you get there. I think, Bill I wish I had all the answers. I think it's wrapped up in a whole bunch of different things that relate to what's going on with vaccines, therapeutics, human nature and just the comfort factor. My own belief is as you continue to get more testing, which is what I've been reinforcing with the White House and everybody that will listen and including antibody testing, that you are going to understand that because the data is pretty clear that while this is a terrible virus and it's affecting people's lives and it's killing people, which is horrific and every life is important, when you get down to it, it has infected a lot more people that we know and the mortality rate is much, much lower than people have thought and the real data suggests there's a very small part of the population that is really at risk.  I think the more of the testing data that comes out even without a vaccine or a therapeutic, the more people are going -- particularly those that are not at risk, the more comfort that they are going to have. With a vaccine and/or therapeutics, I think it's game changing. And so, I'm not trying to be evasive. I just think it's going to be iterative. I think you're going to have drive-to business, you're going to have some fly-to business, people are going to socially space, wear a mask and all that, and there will be people that go out. The more they understand the real mortality rate, the more therapeutics and/or vaccine progress we have. I think if will, as I said two or three different times, I think when you wake up in a couple of years, it'll feel a lot more like it did 90 days ago than it does now and the past depends on a whole bunch of variables that are not particularly well known. But I think that it will progress, we will recover first with more drive-to, some fly-to and that will happen. I mean, people are -- you're going to -- this summer, you start looking at the airline numbers and you're going to see a big shift, up. It's not going to be anywhere near where it was, but in my opinion, this summer, you will see a heck of a lot more people getting on planes and in airports than you see right now. So, I think it's just going to be a progression. \nBill Crow: I hope you're right. Chris, if I can just follow up with one other question that I'm not sure you can answer. But as you look out, you talked about two, three, four years out using this period for innovation and whatnot. Do you think the operating cost or cost per occupied room will be lower or higher as we start to stabilize this industry?\nKevin Jacobs: Lower, for sure. Lower. I mean just because all the things that we're working on, I can't tell you how much lower, because I don't have the answer yet. But clearly, I mean, there are a few things Bill as you might guess that, that are going to cost a little bit more like our CleanStay standard working with Lysol and Mayo. Yes, Lysol products may be a little more expensive than some of the products, that's relatively insignificant. Other things that we're thinking about in terms of garnering efficiencies vastly outweigh that. So I think when we wake up on a stabilized basis, operating costs are going to go down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked, but I did want to follow up on the unit growth question and I appreciate how difficult it is to have visibility on this. You were talking about financing that there will be capital available. But I guess just thinking about from a perspective of owner appetite and when you look at historic downturns, anything under construction as you pointed out would open and the decline or like a slower rate of growth typically in supplies would usually come a year or two later because of those new projects. So, I wonder if you could talk about kind of owner appetite. It seems like given even what you're saying about how it could take a couple of years to get back to 2019 levels, that may be an owner or developer that hasn't put a shovel in the ground yet, would be rethinking anything that's not under construction. And then, we would see something much lower than mid single-digit growth in terms of pipeline kind of a year or so out from now?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I think, listen, it's a good point Robin. And certainly that is generally how it worked last time, although not really. I mean, I think the first year after the great financial crisis was the low point and then it sort of started building from there. There was another year in 2012 where we were sort of stayed low/went down a touch because of what you're describing. The difference this time is, it's delayed, right? I mean it's a different crisis and you've just got construction that's being suspended. Things are going to take longer and it's going to push. And then the other thing is you've had -- this is coming at the end of the cycle. So, you just had -- you've had a bunch of deliveries and their existing hotels and there's going to be a little bit less demand for a while and we think more demand for our engine. So, we do think we'll drive a higher level of conversions going forward. And thus, we think a growing trajectory from here. We'll see what happens, but that's what we think.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then one other sort of point on the same topic is, we've looked at all the data historically for hotel removals, right, hotels that closed and never reopened in previous downturns. And interestingly, that doesn't go up a lot, even in '09 that wasn't really that much above average. I would assume that you don't expect removals to be at a higher rate this year is with this issue as well or I mean, but tell me if that's not?\nKevin Jacobs: No, that's accurate. That's accurate. We think removals will be very normal.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nThomas Allen : Just in terms of buybacks, just wanted to -- so, in the prepared remarks in the press release that said, Hilton formally suspend your buyback program, the program remains authorized and you may resume share purchases in the future at any time. How do you think about the buyback program, how do you think about the right leverage levels, any thought there would be helpful? Thank you. \nChris Nassetta: Yes, a really good question. And I'd say a little bit early given where we are to have sort of be dispositive about it. But I don't think long-term we have a -- in the short-term we're not going to be doing dividends and buybacks. We've made that pretty clear. As we get back to recovery and more normalized environment, I don't think our capital allocation strategy has really changed. One might argue even though I think from a liquidity point of view, we find ourselves in a really good position and we did the right things not just post-crisis, but pre-crisis in terms of having credit available, maturity schedule that was very attractive, those weren't lucky. I mean we knew we were at the end of a business cycle, and those are things that we planned out to make sure that we had all the financial flexibility we would need now we know we would have COVID-19, of course not. But we knew we're at the end of the business cycle, and we wanted to have being really set up well for it, and so we are. And so I'd say the this should hopefully be the greatest test of all time for a balance sheet. It's hard to believe another one can be worse given what's happened and I think we feel like we're in a really good position to sort of pass that test and have the liquidity and the credit profile to get through it.  So, I don't think when we get back to a normalized environment, we have a too much of a different view. What I can say is you could argue about would you be a little bit lower leverage than you might have been? I'm sure we will debate that and this isn't the time to conclude that. But more broadly, we will definitely resume at some point when we get to a normalized environment. I believe our intention would be to resume sort of where we left off in terms of our capital allocation strategy. \nChris Nassetta: Okay. I think that's it. Well, it's an interesting call and interesting times. We appreciate everybody's time. I know, we've been talking with lots of people sort of as this has been going on obviously, happy to continue doing that as we work our way through this. As we sad in our comments second quarter will not be pretty, but hopefully third quarter and fourth will be back on the road to recovery. So, everybody stay safe, stay well and we're going to keep working awfully hard to do the right things here and we'll look forward to catching up with you and updating you on where we are after the second quarter. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today's conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter system-wide RevPAR declined 23% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. RevPAR was down across all regions with the weakest results in Asia Pacific. Decreases were primarily driven by occupancy declines with rate pressure from the lower rated business further impacting results. Adjusted EBITDA was $363 million in the first quarter declining 27% year-over-year. Results reflect significant reductions in travel demand and the temporary suspension of operations in a number of hotels across the world. While the decline was somewhat mitigated by greater cost control, more significant measures were largely implemented after quarter end. Management and franchise fees decreased 18% to $422 million driven by RevPAR declines and roughly flat license fees.  Given the extremely challenging operating environment, which included the suspension of operations at 35 of our leased hotels during the quarter, our ownership segment posted a loss due to higher levels of operating leverage and fixed rent structures at some of our leased properties.  Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.74. During the quarter, we opened nearly 9,000 rooms meaningfully lower than prior expectations due to postponed openings driven by COVID-19. Approvals and construction starts increased ahead of our expectations, largely due to the signing of our largest development deal to-date, and agreement with Resorts World for a 3500 room tri-branded hotel resort on the Las Vegas Strip. Much like the rest of our business, development activity for the balance of the year will depend on a number of factors. However, we do expect that our ultimate rate of net unit growth for the year will be significantly lower than our pre-crisis expectations, likely around half the rate or a bit better.  Turning to liquidity, as Chris mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to enhance our position and increase our financial flexibility, including executing on the bond transaction that Chris referenced earlier. We were very pleased with the outcome of that transaction through which we issued two $500 million tranches of senior notes at pricing that was very attractive relative to other transactions executed in the same timeframe. At the time, it also marked the first eight year high yield financing done since the crisis, which allowed us to continue to enhance our maturity schedule. We continue to have no debt maturities prior to 2024 and a well-staggered maturity ladder thereafter. Factoring for the senior note issuance as well as the $1 billion Hilton Honors points presale, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion on a pro forma basis, which we think should provide us with ample liquidity to navigate the current environment and prepare for recovery. Further details on our first quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.  This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. Jamie, can we have our first question please? I think you covered most of it. I think overall embedded in that cash burn -- those cash burn guidance is obviously an assumption of pretty extensive mitigation on our gross controllable expenses outside of G&A. And I'd say on an overall basis, we think we can over the course of the year mitigate about 60% of the gross controllable expenses, but that's all embedded in the cash burn assumption. I think you actually said the third quarter was going to be the worst, but we think the second quarter .... Yes, second quarter. I've already skipped the quarter. Yes, second quarter recovery to a degree. Yes. Yes, so here's what I would say, Carlo, and obviously a good question. Virtually all of the decline in our outlook for NUG for this year is due to delays related to COVID-19. Meaning, we do have in our guidance is always an embedded assumption for conversions. And I'll come back to that, I know that's part of your question. But the decline is really entirely related to delays because going into the year, even for a limited service hotel, if something is expected to open this year, it's going to be under construction this year, right? So, as of -- about a third of the hotels that we had under construction that we expected to open this year, went into some form of suspension over the last month or so as part of the crisis. About half of those that went under suspension are already back under construction, but they're going to be somewhat delayed, right, obviously, because they suspended. And about half of them, the other half we think will resume construction, largely every project we think will resume construction over the balance of year. There certainly will be onesies, twosies of things where a deal might not make sense. But generally, once the hotel starts construction, it opens, right? And so, what that means is almost all of it will push into next year.  So as a result, we think that whatever this year ends up being will be the bottom and that will climb back from there. And yes, on a run rate basis, once we get back to normal, we're more than comfortable with a mid single-digit NUG growth rate. And we think that conversions, there will be some period of time where, obviously at the moment -- although we are working on some conversions as we speak, we're working on a bunch of them actually, but at the moment transaction activity is relatively limited. But in general, we think the crisis will probably create more opportunities than it hurts. And so, hopefully that covers. Yes, sure. Obviously, it's a question that's on a lot of people's minds. So, it's a good one. I think to take a step back if you think about, there's really three buckets of receivables that we have, right? In hotels that we manage which is a minority of the system, right, roughly 70% of the system is franchised. But in hotels that we manage, the owners are responsible for the working capital and all the obligations and some of those ultimately are paid by us and then reimbursed by owners. So there's an opportunity there. Then you have license fees and then system charges as Chris mentioned in his buildup. So those are the three primary buckets.  What I would say in terms of sizing it, first of all, it's really early, right? So if you think about the crisis really starting in March, you don't even build these things until the following month and then you give people 30 days to pay. And so, we're sort of just getting into it. So anything we would say there would be speculative. But that said, embedded -- I think it's probably obvious, but we're saying embedded in the discussion that we've given you both publicly and in some of Chris' commentary earlier is, a working capital of drag, whereas we've said if things stay the way they are, meaning circa 90% down in revenue and in this environment, we have at least 24 months of liquidity and you've got our cash balance. And so, you can sort of just do the math and realize that if things stay the way they are, there is an embedded cash drag in there that could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars ultimately. And so -- but of course, it depends on duration of the cycle, how it plays out? And ultimately, we believe as Chris just got done explaining that, the business is healthy. It's going to come back and when it comes back, we think we're going to get paid. Yes. That's a good question, Anthony. And the reality is, we don't really know. But what I think is that, generally when you come out of these crises, lenders get appropriately more cautious. Although I would say that, even pre-COVID, we were pretty deep into an economic cycle. And so, you were starting to see caution. That said, over the long-term, I would say, for construction, most of the hotels that get built in our system are not actually even financed aggressively. When you're talking about like big full service hotels and luxury hotels, sometimes they use more leverage, but the lion's share of the hotels that get built in our system are not actually financed all that aggressively. You're talking about like 50% loan to cost. And I would say, personally I think that when the business recovers, the lending community will be there and as long as hotels are productive and profitable investments that they'll be able to be financed. And then I think the last thing I'd add is, you have to remember the amount of liquidity that is in the system. Pre-COVID you're talking about like tripling plus of the money supply from quantitative easing and then even more capital being injected into systems globally. There's going to be plenty of capital looking for productive yields. And I would say, for some period of time it will be a distressed environment and then as it always does, it will recover back to normal. Yes, so on the working capital, Stephen, I would say, look the assumptions that we gave publicly which again just to make sure everything -- everyone's clear as part of the bond deal, we said 18 to 24 months, that was pre-money for the bond deal and we ended up upsizing that deal. So, that's sort of how you get to the longer end of that range. I would say that. Again when the crisis is new, things are a little sharper. So, I would -- the way I'd characterize it is, the first month, second quarter of this year probably would be the worst on that front and then it would moderate from there. But again, the assumption.... And from that perspective, again, I said it would be a little bit harsher at the beginning and then it would be relatively flat again in that under those assumptions, with any kind of recovery curve, it gets better from there. Lower, for sure. Lower. I mean just because all the things that we're working on, I can't tell you how much lower, because I don't have the answer yet. But clearly, I mean, there are a few things Bill as you might guess that, that are going to cost a little bit more like our CleanStay standard working with Lysol and Mayo. Yes, Lysol products may be a little more expensive than some of the products, that's relatively insignificant. Other things that we're thinking about in terms of garnering efficiencies vastly outweigh that. So I think when we wake up on a stabilized basis, operating costs are going to go down. No, that's accurate. That's accurate. We think removals will be very normal."

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think we can all agree and certainly probably have all been saying a lot lately, these are truly unprecedented times. COVID-19 has created challenges that our industry has never encountered before. On behalf of Hilton's entire leadership team, I'd like to express our deepest sympathies to those who have lost loved ones during this devastating pandemic. I'd also like to extend our sincere gratitude to the millions of workers on the frontlines across many industries and in many roles, working selflessly to help keep us all safe. I also want to thank our team members around the world for their remarkable dedication, hard work and sacrifice. Many of our own team members have been personally impacted by this crisis and yet, through this adversity, they've continued to spread the light and warmth of hospitality. Across every region, we've adapted quickly to provide hospitality in new ways in our communities.  In London, several of our properties are hosting the National Health Service and other key workers. The Hilton Orlando has been hosting the National Guard and working to distribute essential items to community residents in need and over 500 hotels around the world are being used for recovery efforts. Our properties have also donated thousands of pounds of food and supplies to local food banks. Through the Hilton Effect Foundation, we are providing disaster response grants for organizations and communities fighting the spread of COVID-19. As part of this effort, our Hilton Honors members have donated more than 6.5 million points to these causes.  In partnership with American Express and our ownership community, we committed to donating up to 1 million room nights to frontline medical professionals in the United States to support those who are putting their lives on the line to protect us. Since its launch just four weeks ago, tens of thousands medical professionals have booked hundreds of thousands of rooms through the program. Further building on this initiative, just this week, we and American Express announced a partnership with World Central Kitchen to deliver freshly prepared meals at no charge from restaurants and local communities to frontline responders staying at our hotels. Already active in three major markets, there are plans to expand this initiative in the coming weeks.  Turning to the business, to ensure we effectively navigate this challenging time, we've focused our priorities on three core areas: protect our people; protect our core business; and prepare for recovery. While our long-term goal remains the same to drive loyalty across all of our stakeholders, the current situation requires greater levels of responsiveness and preparedness in the near term. With this in mind, we've worked closely with industry association and the administration to advocate on behalf of our team members and hotel owners, and to help shape the broader recovery. Given our leadership team's extensive crisis management experience, coupled with the global nature of our business, we had a relatively early glimpse of the impact this pandemic started to have in the Asia Pacific region. In response, we took swift action to protect our business and ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to operate in these unprecedented times.  With travel demand at record lows, we currently have suspended operations at approximately 950 or 16% of our hotels globally, including approximately 10% of our hotels in the Americas, 60% of our hotels in Europe, the Middle East in Africa, and 15% of our hotels in Asia Pacific. At the hotel level, we acted quickly at the beginning of the crisis, to make decisions to help our owners respond, including suspending hotel operations, temporarily suspending brand and operating standards, deferring capital expenditure requirements, eliminating quality assurance audits and allowing the use of FF&E reserves for operating expenses. Going forward, we are working closely with our ownership community to define the hotel operating model of the future with a goal of developing operating standards that will keep our customers safe and drive enhanced efficiency and profitability, while continuing to deliver products and service that customers will pay a premium for. At the corporate level, we've reduced executive salaries, furloughed nearly two-thirds of our corporate workforce, eliminated other non-essential expenses, including capital expenditures and suspended share buybacks and dividends. Further, as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility, we drew down on the remaining amount under our credit facility, pre-sold Hilton Honors points to American Express and successfully executed a bond offering, all of which resulted in a pro forma cash position of $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which we believe has more than adequate liquidity to get us through the crisis. Turning to the quarter RevPAR declined 23% with performance through February, largely in line with our expectations excluding the Asia Pacific region. RevPAR in March dropped 57%, as the virus spread across Europe and the U.S. Overall, we do not think our first quarter results provide clear insight into the current environment, as the timing of the pandemic and we -- given the timing of the pandemic and we expect a much more dramatic impact on our second quarter results. With travel at a virtual standstill, we expect system-wide RevPAR declined roughly 90% in April.  With that being said, we are starting to see glimmers of travel resuming and economies reopening. In China, nearly all 150 hotels that have been closed due to the pandemic have since reopened with occupancies reaching more than 50% during the May Day holiday this past weekend, up significantly from 9% in early February. Additionally, the majority of our previously halted construction projects in China have restarted. In the U.S. and Europe, we're starting to see sensible and staged re-openings of economies. We think temporary hotel suspensions have plateaued and we are now seeing reopening requests. Our sales teams are engaged with customers on business for the back half of the year and into 2021 and beyond. In the last week alone, we booked tens of billions of dollars in Group business in the Americas.  In addition, we are starting to see double-digit increases in digital traffic and booking activity across all segments. Global occupancy levels have gone from a low point of 13% to 23% currently. Assuming we start to see mobility and we don't have a significant recurrence, demand should slowly rebuild in the third quarter. These green shoots allow us to keep our eye on what the future of hospitality may look like. As we carefully consider what travelers needs will be in a post-COVID-19 world, we are proud to announce a partnership with Lysol and the Mayo Clinic last week to introduce Hilton CleanStay, a new program that will deliver an industry-defining standard of cleanliness at all of our properties around the world. We believe this program is the first of many steps we can take to build on the trust and loyalty of our more than 106 million Hilton Honors members as they begin to travel again. A full recovery will take time, and it could take several years to return to the hotel demand levels we experienced in 2019. But as we shift our focus to the future, we are incredibly confident about the long-term prospects of the business and our model. Our industry leading brands, powerful commercial engines, and innovative technology platforms should enable us to continue delivering incremental value to guests, owners and shareholders for years to come.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for details on the first quarter. Wow! That's about 20 questions in there, Joe. Good job. I can't either. Yes. We can't, as we said, we're not giving guidance. So we'll answer what we can but happy to talk about the sensitivities at a high level. I would say, as we look at the, what I think would be helpful sort of RevPAR to EBITDA relationship, the way I would think about it in terms of sensitivities and there's thousands of assumptions as you would guess that go into this is, if you have RevPAR declines -- and we're not giving guidance, so we're not going to suggest what we think they are for the year and you guys have views, I would say the model is such that up to around 30% RevPAR declines, the whole company RevPAR to EBITDA is a bit better than 1-to-1 and when it goes over 30%, it's a bit worse than 1-to-1 but not materially so. The base fee business throughout that continuum is better than 1-to-1 and what obviously hurts as the higher you go is a certain level of negative operating leverage because no matter how much you cut corporate costs, which we've done a lot of, there's a limit to how far you can go and keep the system going. And then in real estate, the lower the RevPAR is given that these are leased assets with some degree of fixed rent structure, that creates a tailwind. But again, that's a very small part of the business overall and has been. So, it keeps us even -- I've seen the industry sort of numbers I've seen from a bunch of folks I think including you are sort of minus 50 for the year, sort of funny to hear myself say that. But if you're doing this for 35 plus years, that's what the industry thinks. I think, as I said, our ratio, EBITDA -- overall ratio would be a little bit -- a touch above 1-to-1. The base fee business would be better even at those levels. On G&A -- on sort of the G&A as we see it on a GAAP basis, I think given the mitigation that we have done with an assumption that as you get into the third and fourth quarter, you will have some sort of -- you will start to see recovery. I mean, the truth is, while it's slow, we're starting to see it now. We've gone from 13% to 23% already, not a lot to be thankful for, but we do believe once you get through the epicenter of the crisis, which it feels like from a health point of view, we are. And you get into reopening parts of the world that haven't reopened, including United States, you'll start to improve in the third and in fourth quarter. I think when you net all that out, probably G&A is 25% to 30% lower. Remembering for us, and it's a point worth making, our G&A for the last three years has basically been flat. We are we believe always very disciplined about our G&A. And coming into the year we were actually guiding before pre-COVID-19 to a modest decline in G&A. Obviously, that decline, given the mitigation that that we have gone through to sort of right size the business for the operating environment will be much greater than what we would have suggested pre-COVID-19, but sort of in the ranges that I talked about.  On cash burn, and we have already as part of the bond deal and otherwise put out public information on that, I think the way to think about it is in the environment, we're sort of in the second quarter, which I said, I don't believe we will maintain that level of performance, and I think the third quarter will be the worst of it, even at those levels that are sort of circa 80% to 90% off. We think we have at least 24 months of liquidity. And if you take sort of industry, the industry view that I'm seeing broadly that I discussed earlier, actually, is that at that level of performance, we are better than cash flow positive. So, that hopefully gives you sort of a bit of a range, again recognizing we're not giving specific guidance but just trying to give you a general trajectory. Kevin, what did I miss out of his laundry list? Second quarter. I did say that? Well, there are going to be a lot of similarities, Carlo, and then some differences as you might guess. I mean, I think that the economic fallout we'll see -- I mean, I think the economic fallout here is likely to be greater. And then you put on top of that a mobility issue and a health and hygiene issue, which is people not wanting to for a period of time until maybe there's a vaccine or therapeutics or we get past this, not wanting to congregate in large groups. So, I think being pragmatic about it, and just straight forward about it, I think Group always is the last to recover. In the 30 whatever years I've been doing this and going through these ups and downs, Group is the last recovers for no other reason that it's longer lead business, right? So, it's sort of logical. I think here it will be a little longer than normal because of those factors. I think the economic impact is going to be greater than most of what we've seen in my time, and we have to get -- people are going to have to sort of not only just come out of their foxholes, but ultimately get comfortable congregating again. All of that I think will happen. By the way, I think the business, when you get two or three years out, will look a lot more like it did 90 days ago than it looks right now. I think it will look very, very similar to it. But I think, it's going to take time and progression. It's going to depend on what happens with reopening. It's going to depend on what happens with how we fight COVID-19. It's going to depend on things that are unknowns today, which is where we end up with vaccines and therapeutics. I'm super optimistic based on the people I'm talking to about those things. But I'm not a health expert and I'm not in the pharma business and I don't know. But those things are all sort of variables that it is just too early to judge.  So, I think, the simple answer would be -- I think, what would the contours of this recovery, like prior recoveries to a degree, with a little bit of nuance will be leisure transient first, business transient second, and group third. I think they're all going to be a little bit different in contours than prior cycles for obvious reasons of the impact of COVID-19 being different in terms of the impact that it has on people and business. But I think that, that is the progression. And while you didn't ask it, I'll say it, I do think as we get in \u2013 correcting -- thank you for correcting me, Kevin, I do think Q2 is going to be very bad because we know that. I do think you will start as we get reopening around the world and America is moving again, if the government and the state -- federal government and state governments are responsible, I've been on the council for reopening and so I think there's a sensible dialogue going on there. You will start to see a recovery in as you get into Q3 in my opinion in Q4, I think that the initial stages of that just given how very low Q2 is, will look like a pretty decent snapback but trying to -- but I don't want to be pollyannaish. Getting back to sort of the levels of occupancy, like for us that were in the low to -- low mid 70s in 2019, which were all time highs, that's going to take time. I think you will see the down, you'll see a bit of a snapback as you get mobility off of a very low levels and then I think you're going to sort of slowly recover, as people get more comfort and businesses start to get back in business, start to think about hiring and investing and all those kind of things. And that, as I said in my prepared comments that's going to take two or three years to get back in my opinion to those levels and that's the -- my honest view. The truth is, this thing is moving really fast. So -- and there are a lot of unknowns, as I just said. So, that's my view, based on what I see and I've seen a lot and talked to a lot of people, but time will tell, which is exactly why we haven't given guidance because it's just too early to know. But everybody on this call knows I'm a born optimist, and that will never change. So, I feel spectacularly good about the long-term for the industry. I feel spectacularly good about our model and the long-term opportunities for Hilton and we just sort of have to go through a period of time to rebuild and get back on our feet as an industry and a company to get back to where we were. I mean, it's anybody's guess. I mean, certainly I've done more WebEx meetings and Zoom than I ever want to do in my life. I don't know about all of you. Maybe it's [indiscernible] -- I'm tired of it. The last thing I'm going to want to do when I get done with this is do another video conference and I'm by the way hearing that from a lot of people. So, the honest answer is, I don't know. I would say, on the margin, yes, there's going to be certain trip occasions where maybe because people have become more accustomed to this out of necessity to sort of be able to function that they'll think, well, I can do that. I don't have to do a trip. But I think much like the debates that I've been part of for the last 20 or 30 years is has evolved, I think it is an unstoppable force that people want to travel and see each other and meet to, to build relationships, whether that is personal or related to business. I don't think that will change. I don't think globalization is going to stop. I don't think the need for people to travel the world is going to stop. And I am highly confident we can all wake up in two or three years -- and you can tell me I was right or wrong, but I am highly confident and as I said, when you wake up at two or three years, the world's going to -- it's hard to see it now, the world is going to look awful a lot like it did 90 days ago in terms of customer behavior and demand patterns, and alike. There will be some differences. As I said, maybe on the margin, there's some business transient where people do it, but I think they're going to want to see people. They're going to be other things that happened, that changed, but it's going to be things I think that were sort of forming where it will accelerate other things, like our digital key, digital check-in which we've had great adoption. I think we'll have massive adoption. Connected room, where you get in a room, you don't have to mess with the remote control or touch switches. I think people will sort of adopt those things.  So, I think, the digital world was already very important to us. I think it's going to get more important because some of those trends are going to be accelerated. But I do not -- I wake up at night, thinking about a lot of things these days. I do sleep, but I get up awfully early as I told Kevin. But I do not worry that people are not going to want to see each other, meet with each other and ultimately congregate. I think that is the human condition, and I think there is an argument that on the margin I described, it could take some trip occasions. There's also, I think an even better argument that people are going to want to see people more than ever. They just need to feel safe, right? And I think when they feel safe, they will go back largely to their own patterns and behaviors. Looking at the great -- looking at prior activities, I think 9/11 is probably the most instructive, while it's not the same, because none of this is unprecedented as we keep saying, there's some lessons that were learned there. Like, basically everybody said, well, after 9/11, nobody traveled, they did. Video conferencing wasn't as good, but they figured out other ways to do things, because they were afraid to get on planes and travel and go out. You're fast forward, two or three years, we had figured out how to manage the world and figured out how to not get rid of terrorism but manage it. And people went back largely to their prior behaviors with it. It did accelerate a few things that were not, frankly I would argue, harmful that were probably helpful. I think, the same thing is going to happen here. I think as we get through this and we realize that COVID-19 and these types of viruses are a part of our future, they have been, we have dealt with the seasonal flu. There was a time where dealing with the seasonal flu felt like this. That we will figure out as a global community how to deal with this. We will hopefully have a vaccine. Time will tell. We will certainly have more therapeutics. We will certainly have better practices and procedures to make sure that we protect the very small part of the global population that is really, truly most impacted by this. And I think as people then start to feel like this is a safe environment, they are going to go back largely to their old behaviors, I would bet a lot of money on it. And that's what history would tell you. I would say I have been talking to a lot of my peers, but looking at the data, to be honest, I thought at least in the last couple weeks, and in these days it's like every week makes a difference. But based on the conversations I have had over the last couple -- over the last month or two and then just looking at the data, I think while we're not in some -- let's be clear we're not showing robust recovery trends right now, I said we are like teeny type in China we are, but the rest of the world, it's like teeny tiny step forward. I think the airlines are way behind. And if you just look at the passenger mile data, how many enplanements, they're just way behind and here's the thing. That's because people are real -- those that are willing to travel are only willing to go so far from home. So, as I think about our team, you didn't ask, but I'll answer because we're spending an immense amount of time on recovery. I spent -- I had all 500 of our commercial leaders around the world on a Zoom call yesterday and talking about how we're retooling our approach to go to market over the next 6, 12, whatever it takes, 18 months, and that is going to be really much more about local business and a lot more in the beginning about drive to business, right?  So, if you if you think about it, I mean, sort of the natural human reaction is like I'm going -- I want to move, I want to get out, I'm starting to feel safe, I'm going to get out of my house, I'm going to go to my neighborhood, maybe I'll sort of move around the region, maybe I'll go to the region next door, eventually I'm going across the country, I'm going to get on a plane go around the world, but I think it's in that progression. So, if you think about it that way, while we've seen a little bit of pickup, I would argue, almost all of it has been in drive-to. And we -- thankfully, we have a big portfolio, a lot of brands, we have a lot of drive, we have in the world 2,600 or 2,700 Hampton Inns. And we have thousands, I think limited service hotels in the U.S., we have almost 4.000 of them and they are very well set up for that sort of local street corner type business and drive-to business.  So, I think there's a little bit of a disconnect, and there will be for a period of time where I think we will likely show I think recovery at a faster pace because we can accommodate types of demand that don't require travel. Ultimately, we need airlines. We need people to get on planes to get to the nirvana, which is back to more normal patterns of demand. Obviously, that has to happen. But in the short-term, I think it's going to be a little bit more local or little a bit more drive-to and in our industry, if you can accommodate that business it's going to be ahead of you. Sure. So this is something I commented on for a good reason in my prepared comments as we're spending as you would guess a huge amount of time with our franchise and broader ownership community because they are the engine of our growth and they are our most important partners in business. And times are difficult for everybody, but times are more difficult for them given the situation, which is no -- essentially no demand or very little demand yet, even with furloughs and all those things, they still have to pay debt service. They still have to pay for insurance and real estate taxes and utilities and all that kind of stuff. So, we've had a multi-tiered approach. I'd say, first and foremost, and I talked about it a little bit, a very little bit. We and I have been deeply involved in what's been going on with the Federal Government, both with the administration and on the hill to try and get liquidity relief for the industry, which is our ownership community, and frankly trying to get relief for our frontline team members that have been furloughed and not in any way relief for Hilton. We don't need it. We have not asked for it in any way, shape or form. But we have been pushing really hard with the administration, treasury. I've had lots of conversations with all the right people, including the President, Secretary Mnuchin throughout the PPP. Reality is, I could go on a long time, you don't want me to. PPP is a really good program and Congress and the administration should be given a lot of credit for moving that fast and getting that much money into the system that will help owners and small business folks. And ultimately employees keep -- stay on the payroll. Reality is, for our industry, it hasn't been as -- just because of the complexity of ownership structures and alike, it has not been that helpful. The second wave hopefully is more helpful. But the fed getting ready to launch a Main Street Lending Program, which we're working very hard on to make sure that there is more access. And so, a bunch of our owners by the way, lots and lots, dozens and dozens have had access to PPP. We're hoping that a much larger set of them get access to Main Street Lending Program. And so, that is an important part of what we're doing because they need a bridge, right? I mean ultimately we're also working with the administration on stimulus for the industry when we get the other side to get demand going and people reemploy but right now our owners need a bridge. So, we've been working very hard in that regard.  We also, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, have done tons of things in terms of by the way suspending operations at 950 hotels. We've never done that, right? In the 100 years we've been around, other than closing a hotel to tear it down or whatever, we've never done that. We've suspended massive amounts of our brand standards, operating standards, capital programs and a whole bunch of other things to sort of really give them huge flexibility in how they operate, which I think they have appreciated. As I also mentioned, one of the most important things that we're doing right now which I'm spending and our team is spending an immense amount of time on, which I mentioned very lightly is the hotel operating model of the future. We're working with all of our owners, franchisees across every brand, every category to figure out -- we've already done the short-term, but intermediate and long term. How do we use this time -- necessity, as I like to say, does become the mother of invention. To think about things that we've been exploring or thinking about -- and that we think makes sense to create more efficiency, what better time to sort of think about our standards and sort of put them all in the bucket and really put a bright light on them. And so we're doing that with deep involvement of our owner advisory councils. We kicked this off a couple weeks ago and we're in full swing and that's incredibly important work as we again get to the other side and hopefully get stimulus from the government, which I think we will, and that we create an opportunity in the intermediate term for them to be able to operate at lower demand levels and still have profitability and in longer term, as we get back to normal have even greater levels of profitability than when we went into it.  In terms of fee relief, I would say you wouldn't be surprised to hear that there have been owners that have asked for fee relief. But not -- hand over fist and the reality is, I think there's a real simple reason, our fee structure as you know which is different for different players in the industry, all of our fee structures, whether it's the franchise fee or management fee or the system charges, they're all based on a percentage of revenue. So, we have given the ultimate fee relief, meaning when you're 90% off, there really aren't many fees because there's not much revenue. And so I think most of the owners -- everybody would like every bit of help that they can get. I think most of the owners that I have talked to sort of understand that the fees have been right sized with the demand in the business that they're not at the moment sadly for us and sadly for them, they're not paying us a lot of fees in any event, so that we will continue to look at all options with our community. As we said there is no more important partner and stakeholder that we have. They are the engine of opportunity for us. They're investing all the capital they have been and I believe they will -- as Kevin noted with the pipeline and NUG numbers, they will continue to do so.  And so we are literally in personally I'm in daily conversations with huge numbers of them. And I think you can ask them yourself, and while we're never going to be perfect, so far the feedback I get from our owner community and you can validate it, is very high marks. That we were there earlier than most understanding the severity of this. We took very decisive and bold actions to provide relief early. And again, while we're not perfect my impression in the owners and I'm talking to hundreds of them is while they're hurting, they are certainly appreciating the partnership that we have provided. It's a really good question. I think in the short-term, as we've been talking to customers and serving customers, everybody gets what's going on in the world. So, they're incredibly lenient. And so, we have not serving sadly, that many customers but those that we are -- who are mostly on the frontlines of recovery efforts have been fine with all of the standard changes in suspension of certain elements of the service. The work that I described that we're doing is sort of in the intermediate and long-term in making sure that we; one, create the most efficient operating model; and two, obviously, continue as implied to your question to drive premium market share. I mean, we're not -- we continue to have the premium market share in the industry, we have no plans to give that up. The trick is, as we transition from the intermediate to the longer term, what are the things that you basically put back into the standards and what do you take -- what do you leave out and/or change. And that's sort of I can't give you the answer and not because I don't want to, I don't have it yet. I mean, that's the work that we are doing right now. I suspect that what we will do is test a whole bunch of different things. I know we will, as well others during the intermediate timeframe when customers are very forgiving, and what we're going to do is iterate, with the objective of making sure that we are delivering premium product and service always to get our market share premium, but we want to drive efficiency. So, short-term is easy, intermediate term, I think will be a significant opportunity for testing when you're still in a relatively low demand environment where customers are still quite sort of accepting of things that are different. And then I think what we learn in that intermediate timeframe, we will sort of institute as our longer range standards and we're working through all of that.  I think there'll be a whole bunch of things that we'll do that'll be more efficient long-term, and they're going to be some that we're going to have some standards that we are going to -- that our customers are going to want in a more normalized environment and we're going to reinstitute. Yes, you stay that way. Yes. We have done a bunch of things if you look at it I'd say. First of all, not that we have a lot of business, but our Honors occupancy with the modest business we have has skyrocketed. So, it was already very high and now it's a lot higher because seemingly they are more willing to travel than I guess non-Honors members. But, what we've been focused on during this timeframe and you can see it in a lot of the things I talked about and that you would see publicly is, people aren't traveling that much. So, what can we do to build loyalty? We can give them flexibility, so we -- in the industry, we were the first ones, I believe. Certainly we were very early to come out and give very significant cancellation flexibility. We were definitely the first to come out and give status, allow people to remain -- keep their status. We were definitely the first to come out and say, we weren't going to -- we are not going to have points expire. We did a bunch of things to say to our Honors members, no fault of your own, you can't travel and we're not going to hold that against you. We've been communicating with them regularly. And so far, I'd say that's going well. The work that we're doing in the community, we're doing that because we want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. So, our 1 million room nights with AMEX to first responders for free, our World Central Kitchen work, all of the other work that we're doing is about sort of continuing to build our brand, the Honors brand with consumers who are sitting around and can't move but are watching a lot of TV and reading a lot, doing a lot of social media and they're seeing these things. The net result is, in terms of our numbers, our marketing team has been looking at it, like intent to consider purchase of our product, Net Promoter Score, whatever, those numbers have gone way up through the crisis. As a result, people realizing, we're doing the right things. And so, my attitude, which is the way I think about life, when you go into this, just like the way I thought about it when we went into the great recession, which was different. But similar is, when everything is good, it's really hard to differentiate yourself. I mean, I think we have -- I think we've done a great job, but you get caught up in an arms race. When everything is bad, people peel off and go different directions and you have a real opportunity to differentiate yourself. And so, what I said from the day we got in this crisis is, as much as we need to solidify the core and deal with liquidity with Kevin and the team have done an amazing job on and protects -- and deal with the cost structure and all the things, we have been crazy focused on making sure we are listening to customers, particularly Honors members and doing the right thing for them, that we are crazy focused on our owners, as I've already talked a lot about to do everything we can for them, that we're crazy involved in our communities so that people remember that, because we're part of the solution because that will continue to build loyalty. And obviously as impactful as it has been to our team members that as we're impacting them, we're doing it in the right way, in a way that is really taking care of them as best we can. And so, my attitude is, well, this is all painful, there's no other way to describe it. What we do now, will determine our future, and we are absolutely committed as a team and a company to continue to differentiate ourselves with all of our stakeholders and to come out the other side of this stronger, including with our Honors members. And so far, we're I think doing a very good job doing that. Well, to a degree yes, but let me let me reframe it a little bit. What I was saying which is right. To get back to full recovery, I think the airlines are a gating issue. People have to be comfortable to get on planes, planes have to be flying, there's a bunch of the business particularly in the big -- in the major markets that are -- that is flied to. And so to get to full recovery you have to have that. I absolutely believe you can get a significant amount of recovery before you get there. I think, Bill I wish I had all the answers. I think it's wrapped up in a whole bunch of different things that relate to what's going on with vaccines, therapeutics, human nature and just the comfort factor. My own belief is as you continue to get more testing, which is what I've been reinforcing with the White House and everybody that will listen and including antibody testing, that you are going to understand that because the data is pretty clear that while this is a terrible virus and it's affecting people's lives and it's killing people, which is horrific and every life is important, when you get down to it, it has infected a lot more people that we know and the mortality rate is much, much lower than people have thought and the real data suggests there's a very small part of the population that is really at risk.  I think the more of the testing data that comes out even without a vaccine or a therapeutic, the more people are going -- particularly those that are not at risk, the more comfort that they are going to have. With a vaccine and/or therapeutics, I think it's game changing. And so, I'm not trying to be evasive. I just think it's going to be iterative. I think you're going to have drive-to business, you're going to have some fly-to business, people are going to socially space, wear a mask and all that, and there will be people that go out. The more they understand the real mortality rate, the more therapeutics and/or vaccine progress we have. I think if will, as I said two or three different times, I think when you wake up in a couple of years, it'll feel a lot more like it did 90 days ago than it does now and the past depends on a whole bunch of variables that are not particularly well known. But I think that it will progress, we will recover first with more drive-to, some fly-to and that will happen. I mean, people are -- you're going to -- this summer, you start looking at the airline numbers and you're going to see a big shift, up. It's not going to be anywhere near where it was, but in my opinion, this summer, you will see a heck of a lot more people getting on planes and in airports than you see right now. So, I think it's just going to be a progression. Yes. I think, listen, it's a good point Robin. And certainly that is generally how it worked last time, although not really. I mean, I think the first year after the great financial crisis was the low point and then it sort of started building from there. There was another year in 2012 where we were sort of stayed low/went down a touch because of what you're describing. The difference this time is, it's delayed, right? I mean it's a different crisis and you've just got construction that's being suspended. Things are going to take longer and it's going to push. And then the other thing is you've had -- this is coming at the end of the cycle. So, you just had -- you've had a bunch of deliveries and their existing hotels and there's going to be a little bit less demand for a while and we think more demand for our engine. So, we do think we'll drive a higher level of conversions going forward. And thus, we think a growing trajectory from here. We'll see what happens, but that's what we think. Yes, a really good question. And I'd say a little bit early given where we are to have sort of be dispositive about it. But I don't think long-term we have a -- in the short-term we're not going to be doing dividends and buybacks. We've made that pretty clear. As we get back to recovery and more normalized environment, I don't think our capital allocation strategy has really changed. One might argue even though I think from a liquidity point of view, we find ourselves in a really good position and we did the right things not just post-crisis, but pre-crisis in terms of having credit available, maturity schedule that was very attractive, those weren't lucky. I mean we knew we were at the end of a business cycle, and those are things that we planned out to make sure that we had all the financial flexibility we would need now we know we would have COVID-19, of course not. But we knew we're at the end of the business cycle, and we wanted to have being really set up well for it, and so we are. And so I'd say the this should hopefully be the greatest test of all time for a balance sheet. It's hard to believe another one can be worse given what's happened and I think we feel like we're in a really good position to sort of pass that test and have the liquidity and the credit profile to get through it.  So, I don't think when we get back to a normalized environment, we have a too much of a different view. What I can say is you could argue about would you be a little bit lower leverage than you might have been? I'm sure we will debate that and this isn't the time to conclude that. But more broadly, we will definitely resume at some point when we get to a normalized environment. I believe our intention would be to resume sort of where we left off in terms of our capital allocation strategy. Okay. I think that's it. Well, it's an interesting call and interesting times. We appreciate everybody's time. I know, we've been talking with lots of people sort of as this has been going on obviously, happy to continue doing that as we work our way through this. As we sad in our comments second quarter will not be pretty, but hopefully third quarter and fourth will be back on the road to recovery. So, everybody stay safe, stay well and we're going to keep working awfully hard to do the right things here and we'll look forward to catching up with you and updating you on where we are after the second quarter."

This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. As our results show, we made significant progress in our recovery throughout 2021. We saw a meaningful increase in demand for travel and tourism and our team members around the world were there to welcome guests with our signature hospitality as they look to reconnect and create new memories. We continued to demonstrate our resiliency by remaining laser-focused on providing reliable and friendly service to our guests and by launching several new industry-leading offerings to provide them even more choice and control. We also continued to expand our global footprint, adding even more exciting destinations to our portfolio and achieving a record year of room openings. All of this, together with our resilient business model, translated into solid results. For the full year, we grew RevPAR 60% and adjusted EBITDA 93%. Both RevPAR and adjusted EBITDA were approximately 30% below 2019 peak levels. More importantly, our margins were 500 basis points above 2019 peak levels, reaching roughly 66% for the full year. While some costs will come back in as we continue to recover, we remain extremely focused on cost discipline. Given our asset-light business model and the actions we took during the pandemic to further streamline our operations, we expect permanent margin improvement versus prior peak levels in the range of 400 to 600 basis points over the next few years. Turning to results for the quarter. RevPAR increased 104% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was up 151%. RevPAR was roughly 87% of 2019 levels with ADR nearly back to prior peaks. Compared to 2019, occupancy improved versus the third quarter with higher demand across all segments. Strong leisure over the holiday season drove U.S. RevPAR to more than 98% of 2019 levels for December. Business travel also improved sequentially versus the third quarter, with solid demand in October and November before the Omicron variant weighed on recovery in December. For the quarter, business transient room nights were approximately 80% of 2019 levels. Group RevPAR improved 11 percentage points over the third quarter to roughly 70% of 2019 levels. Performance was largely driven by strong social business, while recovery in company meetings and larger groups continued to lag. As we kicked off the new year, seasonally softer leisure demand, coupled with incremental COVID impacts due to the Omicron variant, tempered the positive momentum we saw through much of the fourth quarter. For January, system-wide RevPAR was approximately 75% of 2019 levels. Despite some near-term choppiness, we remain optimistic about accelerated recovery across all segments throughout 2022. We anticipate strong leisure trends to continue again this year, driven by pent-up demand and nearly $2.5 trillion of excess consumer savings. Our revenue position for Presidents' weekend is seven percentage points ahead of 2019 levels. And our position for weekends generally is up significantly for the year, both indicating continued strength in leisure travel. Similarly, we expect growth in GDP and nonresidential fixed investment, coupled with more flexible travel policies across large corporate customers to fuel increasing business transient trends. As a positive indication of business transient recovery, at the beginning of January, midweek U.S. transient bookings for all future periods were down 13% from 2019 levels and improved to just down 4% by the end of the month. Additionally, STR projects U.S. business transient demand will return to 92% of pre-pandemic levels in 2022. On the group side, our position for the year is to remain steady as Omicron-related disruption was largely contained to the first quarter of 2022 with most events rescheduled for later in the year. We continue to expect meaningful acceleration in group business in the back half of the year as underlying group demand remains strong. Compared to 2019, our tentative booking revenue was up more than 25%. Additionally, meeting planners are increasingly more optimistic with forward bookings trending up week over week since early January. Overall, we remain very confident in the broader recovery and our ability to keep driving value on top of that. This should allow us to generate strong free cash flow growth and our expectation is to reinstate our quarterly dividend and begin buying back stock in the second quarter. Turning to development. We opened more than a hotel a day in 2021, totaling 414 properties and a record 67,000 rooms. Conversions represented roughly 20% of openings. We achieved net unit growth of 5.6% for the year, above the high end of our guidance and added approximately 55,000 net rooms globally, exceeding all major branded competitors. Our outperformance reflects the power of our commercial engines, the strength of our brands and our disciplined and diversified growth strategy. Fourth quarter openings totaled more than 16,000 rooms, driven largely by the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. In the quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 400th hotel in China and our first Home2 Suites in the country. This positive momentum continued into the new year with the highly anticipated opening of the Conrad Shanghai just last month, marking the brand's debut in one of the world's busiest and most exciting markets. During the quarter, we also continued the expansion of our luxury and resort portfolios with the opening of the Conrad Tulum and the new all-inclusive Hilton Cancun. With more than 400 luxury and resort hotels around the world and hundreds more in the pipeline, we remain focused on growing in these very important categories. We were also thrilled to welcome guests to the Motto New York City Chelsea, a major milestone for this quickly growing brand and a perfect addition to Hilton's expanding lifestyle category. This hotel exemplifies what it means to be a lifestyle property. It incorporates unique and modern design elements and provides guests with authentic and locally minded experiences. We also celebrated the first lifestyle property in Chicago with the opening of the Canopy Chicago Central Loop and debuted the brand in the U.K. with the opening of the Canopy London City. These spectacular properties joined recently opened Canopy hotels in Paris, Madrid and S\u00e3o Paulo. In 2021, we grew our Canopy portfolio by more than 1/3 year-over-year, opening hotels across all major regions. We ended the year with 408,000 rooms in our development pipeline, up 3% year-over-year, even after a record year of openings. Our pipeline represents an industry-leading 38% of our existing supply, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit net unit growth for the next couple of years and eventually return to our prior 6% to 7% growth range. For this year, we expect net unit growth to be approximately 5%. As our guests' travel needs continue to evolve, we again introduced innovative ways to enhance the guest experience. In the quarter, we announced the launch of Digital Key Share which allows more than one guest to have access to their room's digital key via the Hilton Honors app. To further reward our most loyal Hilton Honors members, we introduced automated complimentary room upgrades, notifying eligible members of upgrades 72 hours prior to arrival. With our guests at the heart of everything we do, we've been thrilled to hear that the early feedback for both industry-leading features has been overwhelmingly positive. In the quarter, Hilton Honors membership grew 13% year-over-year to more than 128 million members. Honors members accounted for 61% of occupancy in the quarter, just a few points below 2019 levels and engagement continued to increase across members of all tiers. We work hard to ensure that our hospitality continues to have a positive impact on the communities we serve. For that reason, we're incredibly proud to be recognized for our global leadership in sustainability. For the fifth consecutive year, we were included on both the World and North America Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, the most prestigious ranking for corporate sustainability performance. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made over the last year and I'm very confident that Hilton is better positioned than ever to lead the industry as we enter a new era of travel. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on the quarter.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 104.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. System-wide RevPAR was down 13.5% compared to 2019 as the recovery continued to accelerate across all segments and regions, driven by border reopenings and strong holiday travel demand. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $512 million for the fourth quarter, up 151% year-over-year. Results reflect the continued recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 91%, driven by strong RevPAR improvement and license fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging operating environment and fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Continued cost discipline mitigated segment losses. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.72. Turning to our regional performance. Fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 110% year-over-year and was down 11% versus 2019. The U.S. benefited from strong leisure demand over the holidays, with transient RevPAR 1% above 2019 levels and transient rate nearly 5% higher than 2019 for the quarter. Group business also continued to strengthen throughout the quarter, with December room nights just 12% off of 2019 levels. In the Americas outside of the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR increased 150% year-over-year and was down 17% versus 2019. Continued easing restrictions and holiday leisure demand drove improving trends throughout the quarter. Canada continued to see steady improvement as borders remained open to vaccinated international travelers. In Europe, RevPAR grew 306% year-over-year and was down 25% versus 2019. Travel demand recovered steadily through November but stalled in December as a rise in COVID cases led to reimposed restrictions across the region. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 124% year-over-year and was up 7% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand and the continued recovery of international inbound travel as restrictions eased. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR fell 1% year-over-year and was down 34% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 24% as compared to 2019 as travel restrictions and lockdowns remained in place. However, occupancy in the country held steady versus the third quarter as summer leisure travel was replaced with local corporate and meetings business. The rest of the Asia Pacific region benefited from relaxed COVID restrictions and the introduction of vaccinated travel lanes in several key markets. Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, for the full year, we grew net units 5.6%. Our pipeline grew sequentially and year-over-year, totaling 408,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 61% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. Demand for Hilton-branded properties remains robust and, along with our high-quality pipeline, we are positioned to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $8.9 billion of long-term debt and $1.5 billion in total cash and cash equivalents. We're proud of the financial flexibility we demonstrated through the pandemic and remain confident in our ability to continue to be an engine of opportunity and growth as we look to reinstate our capital return program. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?\nOperator:  The first question will be from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaunKelley: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nChris Nassetta: Morning, John.\nShaun Kelley: Good morning, Chris. I wanted to dig in a little bit. I thought the margin commentary you gave was interesting, Chris. I mean in general, we don't think of -- I think we think of hotels being more about recovery beneficiaries than we do it thinking through the pandemic and some of the opportunities that may have presented on the cost side. So could you just give us a little bit more color on what some of the key buckets are that have changed in your overall operating model that are driving that improvement? And then secondarily, just help us think through how that might trend over the next couple of years as you kind of ramp up towards that 500 basis point margin target that you mentioned.\nChris Nassetta: Yes, I'm happy to do it. We put it in the comments because the truth is it's, I would argue, very important. I don't think it's had a lot of focus and it has an intense amount of focus inside this company amongst the management team and, for that matter, with our Board of Directors because the idea was, as you would want to do in any crisis, is take advantage of opportunity. And as we went into the crisis, we saw things that we thought we've not only needed to do to address the crisis but we could do to make the business stronger. And so we didn't obviously have a lot to worry about liquidity. We had a lot to worry about but our balance sheet is great. We didn't have a lot of liquidity issues. So we very quickly, not to pat us on the back but it's true. Like in March, April of 2020, we were focused on recovery, how do we get to the other side, what are the things that we can do to make this business faster growing, better, stronger and higher margin. And we've been at it ever since and we'll never stop because we think there are opportunities. I think if you did the math, it sort of comes in three categories that gets you there. Number one, we're bigger. So you have units that have been added at plus 5% a year through COVID that haven't been, during COVID, that productive that are, over the next few years, going to become productive contributors to earnings. We've had great success in our sort of license arrangements and sort of our non-RevPAR-related fee segment of the business. So think our HGV business, think our Amex co-brand business generally where we -- it's a very, very high-margin business and it has performed very well. If you look at the numbers carefully, 2021, we were already over peak levels for those fees -- peak '19 -- 2019 levels and we think there's still meaningful growth to come from that. And then last but not least and importantly, cost structure. We, like everybody, every business that was dramatically impacted by COVID, had to think about cutting costs in hotels and in corporate and we did that. But again, not patting us on the back but reality, we said, like, we don't want to just take cost out. We want to sort of reengineer the way we run the business to be able to -- where we think there might be longer-term efficiencies, realize those and during COVID sort of get -- build it into the DNA of the company. And so we were able to take out a bunch of costs that helped during COVID but that we think we will be able to keep out. When you put all that together, as we said, we think it's 400 to 600 basis points of sort of a real run rate margin improvement. We delivered pretty well against, I thought, last year when we had RevPAR and EBITDA that was 30% off of peak levels and delivering 500 basis point margin levels was pretty compelling as a down payment on what we're saying. Now it won't be a perfectly straight road, meaning there are -- last year, we probably underspent in some areas because it's been hard to hire and all that, corporately. This year, we'll catch up a little bit with that. So it won't be a completely straight line. But as you look out to like '23 and '24, I think we're in those target ranges, hopefully at the midpoint or beyond those, at least as we model it. And as I said, it's not by happenstance, it's not by luck. It's been a huge focus and I think shareholders should feel comfortable that it will remain an intense focus of the enterprise because we know we can. And if we can, we should because ultimately and I won't finish this because I'm sure others have questions that we want to have answered ultimately. Obviously, we're a free -- when we -- in a normal time, we're a free cash flow machine. The higher the margins, the higher the free cash flow and having 500 basis point higher margins allows us to drive a lot more free cash flow that allows us to return a lot more capital over time. And as I said in my prepared comments, we intend to start returning capital in the second quarter. That is the second quarter of this year, that is six weeks from now.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoeGreff: Good morning, everybody.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Greff: I have a two part question on development. One, it's hard not to notice that the managed footprint has caught up at least relative to the growth rate into 2019. How do you see the footprint growth between managed and franchised growing in 2022? I know you talked about 5% this year, longer term 6% to 7%. And then can you also just talk about what's going on development-wise in China currently?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Sure, Joe. I'll take this one. I think it's interesting. I'm not exactly sure what numbers you're looking at. I think our split between managed and franchised, as the pipeline plays out, has been pretty consistent, right? Our existing supply is 75% franchised led by the U.S. and the Americas, of course. But more and more, our pipeline today is 40% franchised outside -- in -- sorry, 40% franchised in EMEA and nearly half franchised in APAC as our franchisee business grows in those regions. And so over time, what had been happening is growing outside the U.S., more of those deals had been managed and that was sort of skewing us back towards managed. And now I'd say we're on a trajectory overall. We'll still add a bunch of managed rooms as we grow outside the U.S. but more and more, we're doing franchising outside of the U.S. And so maybe I'm missing something in your question and I'm happy to do a follow-up but I think that's been pretty consistent and not really moving around that much. And then, interestingly -- and so feel free to follow up. But to get to China, it's interesting. Most of the development trends and I think we've said this on prior calls, have been following the trend of the virus. So meaning, as the world's been opening up in those regions, you see a pretty direct correlation to signing activity and approval activity in those regions, so led by the U.S. Europe had sort of a slow start this year but then really came on towards the end of the year as things start to open up. China has been kind of the exception to that rule, meaning even with lockdowns and people not moving around and you would think not being able to travel across the country, would slow the pace of activity but that just hasn't been the case. So for us, we -- our approvals for 2021 were up 45% for the year and our openings were up 30% over the year. And we think our openings will be up something similar to that over the course of 2022. So China has really been strong, led by our Plateno-Hampton JV. We've now launched Home2 with Country Garden. We've now launched on our own -- an individual franchising program for Hilton Garden Inn, with still a bunch of, Chris mentioned a little bit in our prepared remarks, still a bunch of really great full-service and luxury signings along the way. So China has been a little bit of the exception to the rule with COVID where even in the face of lockdowns, we've had a lot of activity.\nJoe Greff: Great, you answered it . Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nThomasAllen: Thank you. Just a follow-up to Shaun's question, maybe a clarification. As I look at 2024 consensus for you, The Street is looking for $3.1 billion of EBITDA and 70% margin. Your comments earlier, Chris, was we're going to gain 400 to 600 basis points of margin versus 2019 which ties you in that 65%, 66% range. Do you think -- what do you think The Street's modeling -- mis-modeling?\nChris Nassetta: I have no earthly idea. As you know, we haven't been giving guidance for any period of time, let alone for 2024. So Thomas, I think the best thing to do is let my comments stand as they were. We're confident that on a run rate basis, it will sort of be in that range. We're very proud of that, of being able to accomplish that. Obviously, we're always looking to under-promise and over-deliver; so that will never change but not much to add at this point.\nThomas Allen: All right. Chris, just -- I mean, I guess asked another way, two things I was thinking of when you said it: one, there's obviously going to be a mix shift of the lower-margin owned business coming back. And then secondly, when we look at your margins historically, they increased every single year. So I guess the point I'm making is, I think your commentary around margins is more your confidence around resetting margins higher versus commentary that your expense base will grow significantly and you're kind of -- you're stuck at the margin level. Is that the right way to think about it?\nChris Nassetta: I'm not sure I understand but I think so. Yes. I mean we have confidence -- said another way, just to be clear, we have confidence that the structural changes we have made to the company on a like-for-like basis are going to drive higher margins. So if you think that margins were going to continue to grow organically under the prior setup, then we agree with that and we think that there's an incremental piece to it that is a result of structural changes that we've made that we'll maintain.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I'd probably just add to that quickly on the real estate is like you're making a comment about the mix of business but you should remember that the real estate has been shrinking over time. And even though you've had -- you've got different rates of recovery in COVID and different mix, over time, that is going to continue to be a smaller part of the business as we continue to grow the managed and franchised business and continue to work our way out of the risk.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. And not to beat a dead horse but just throw something slightly more on top of the real estate. The real estate, you're right, is a lower-margin business by definition. We have baked that into what we -- what our guidance -- what my summary was of what our expectation is over the next few years. So that was taken into account. It also, from an EBITDA growth point of view, will be tremendously helpful because it was so beat up, given the structure of how much of it is held that from an EBITDA growth rate point of view over the next few years, real estate is going to be very, very helpful, very high growth.\nThomas Allen: Thanks for the clarification.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nSmedesRose: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your thoughts on China. And maybe you could just give us a reminder of what the kind of contribution China made to fees in '19 and maybe kind of how far that fell off in '21, just because it seems like there's an opportunity for some significant rebounding. Maybe it sounds like it's running behind kind of the rest of the world. And if you have any kind of thoughts on maybe how China addresses it's policy around COVID going forward or if they keep the kind of zero tolerance in place indefinitely.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I think China, I'm doing this from memory, I think China '19 was like five points of EBITDA overall. And I would guess at this point, it is less than half of that. So I'm looking at Jill. It's probably 2% or something like that. So I think you're right. There's a significant -- I mean, by the way, that's true for the entire international estate when you think about it. Our Asia Pacific business, our Europe business, they've all been slower to return. And so our EBITDA, if you look at '20 and '21, was crazy disproportionately U.S.-based and those numbers aren't fully back to where they were. I mean we were like 73% U.S. I think in 2020, we were like 94% or 95% and last year, we were like 83% or something. So it's coming back and will ultimately return to a more normalized kind of environment which means not just China but the whole world. The whole world outside of the U.S. has some significant growth potential as we get to a more normalized environment. In terms of the regions generally and I'll end on China and maybe use this as an opportunity to just talk about sort of the rhythms of what's going on, most of which I think is pretty well known because you guys have a lot of data. But if you look at what's going on in the world, the Middle East which is not a huge part of our business, is sort of leading the world. I mean you saw our numbers for the fourth quarter. Middle East is already meaningfully above 2019 levels, so they're sort of ahead in recovery. We think that will continue. The U.S., I would say, is sort of next and we can -- maybe I'll leave it to another question. Our belief is you will see, in the second quarter, a transition and then very rapid recovery, all our earlier prepared comments, in the second half of the year. I think Europe will be quick to follow in the sense that it's more complicated because you have more countries, the restrictions aren't just one set of restrictions but you can start to see it sort of sweeping through Europe opening, sweeping through Europe. Now Asia Pacific, I think, will lag in large part because of China and the policies they've had. My own view and that's all it is. It's not because of insider knowledge is that as the rest of the world opens and as you get which I think we are rapidly approaching to an endemic stage of COVID, I think there'll be a lot of pressure economically, culturally and otherwise for China to open up much like the rest of the world. So I think it will be -- it will lag but I think it will be -- I think Europe and then Asia will be a fast follow. And as I think we -- as we -- my own view as we get to the second half of the year, I think you're in an entirely different environment across the globe. And in the first half of the year, you're going to see things evolving at a slightly different pace. But I think when you get to the second half of the year, every -- the whole world broadly is going to be a lot more open than anything we've seen in two years.\nSmedes Rose: Great, Chris. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nStephenGrambling: Hi, thanks. I'd like to come at margins from maybe the perspective of your owners which is always key to driving that overall flywheel. How are you thinking owner margins will progress versus pre pandemic? And could you tie in how you envision the hotel experience will structurally change, whether it's longer stays, charging or opt-in for cleaning or reducing non-consumer-facing labor? And where do you see the greatest opportunity for investing back into your owners to improve the experience amidst some of these shifting preferences?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Good question, Steve and a little bit to unpack there but I'll sort of try to go in order. I think if you'd take a step back to the beginning of the pandemic, I think we've done a really good job leading -- we did a really good job in the pandemic leading the way with starting out early on, advocating for our owners, whether that was for government assistance or otherwise, being really flexible with standards as the business sort of fell apart a little bit. And through recovery, sort of similar to what Chris has been talking about of really taking the opportunity of COVID to drive improvement through our enterprise, we've been doing the same thing at the property level, right? So it's certain big things you mentioned by being innovative with reengineering our food and beverage and particularly, breakfast offerings, looking at housekeeping and opt-in there and then a bunch of little things across line item by line item sort of literally grinding through the P&Ls and standards with our owners to help them -- help the properties be more profitable through COVID and using that opportunity to make sure that, that profitability and those efficiencies stand going forward. Now people talk about we do need service recovery, right? It has been hard to hire labor. We do need to bring some of those service standards back. Obviously, everybody knows what's going on with inflation and wage inflation. But of course, the flip side of that on inflation is that helps on the revenue line, right? We reprice the rooms every night. If inflation is a headwind, on the cost side, it's going to be a tailwind on the revenue side and the revenue base is obviously bigger than the expense base. And so that ought to lead to higher margins coming out the other side. So when you put that all together, we think we can do a better job for customers, give them what they want, take away what they don't want and what they won't pay for and use driving revenue through an inflationary environment to get our owners to be higher-margin businesses coming out the other side.\nStephen Grambling: Okay, thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrickScholes: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nKevin Jacobs: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: Good morning. When I try to think about some things that have perhaps permanently changed or at least changed from 2019, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on the degree of key money that you're giving today for new hotels under your brand, number one. And how have the franchise contracts changed? Are they more flexible today versus pre COVID, less flexible? I'd just like to hear your thoughts on those.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I think I'll start with the second part. I mean really, there's nothing different about our franchise agreements now versus pre COVID. It's a very well -- it's a business that's been around for a long time. The protocols are established, the franchise documents, you can read them, they're public. They haven't really changed over time. I think when it comes to key money, I mean, you could see in our numbers this year that it's been sort of higher than it had been in the past. I think that's a function of a little bit of -- I don't think it's COVID versus pre COVID. It's a competitive environment out there so there's definitely competition. We're leading the way in growth and our competitors are trying to catch up to us. So that makes for competition. But the reality is, is our number of deals that have key money associated with them is about 10%. That's what it was pre COVID. That's what it is today. So that's been pretty consistent. And we've just been fortunate, over the last particularly a year or so, we've signed some really high-profile deals. I think about the Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach in California. I think about Resorts World in Las Vegas, the deal we did in Cancun and Tulum, those have been deals that we've been working on for a really long time. They're very strategic. They happen to be a little bit higher key money associated with them than we're used to and so we've been a little bit higher. And that trend maybe continues for a little while longer. We have some strategic things in the hopper at the moment that I think might keep that number a little bit elevated over the course of 2022 and maybe even for a little while beyond that. But what I'd say sort of in closing and hopefully, that sort of covers it and Chris may want to add to this a little bit, is relative to our peers, I think we stack up really favorably in terms of what we've been deploying for capital to get to our level of growth, I think, has been exemplary.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRichHightower: Hi, good morning, everybody.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning.\nRich Hightower: So I want to go back to a portion of the prepared comments. And Chris, I think you mentioned it was STR's forecast. I know this is not a Hilton forecast but for business transient demand, I think you get to the low 90s as a percentage of pre-COVID levels this year. So again, not your forecast but I am wondering if you could take me through the building blocks in your mind as to perhaps how we might get to that level by the end of this year, especially in the context of hybrid workforces, work from home and so forth.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I -- yes, it is in our forecast but I do buy into it. And I think actually, it might be even better than that personally, my own opinion. I think there's a really good chance, on a run rate basis, that we will end up back at or above where we were in 2019 before the year is out. So why do I think that? One, there's a lot of pent-up demand. That obviously helps and Omicron created more pent-up demand because a lot of people didn't do trips. But I can't speak for the industry. I can speak for us. We're out talking to customers all the time, sort of large, medium, small. And what you find is like heretofore during the crisis, the largest corporate customers have been way off on travel. So they've been like 80 -- well, I'd say through the third and fourth quarter, they were 70% or 80% off still. But what happened is that SME, small, medium enterprises were out traveling like crazy. I've given these stats before on calls. Pre COVID, 80% of our business transient was SMEs. 20% of it or 10% of the overall business was large corporate. So it's not that we don't love them and we don't want them but we were never ultimately that dependent on that. So what happened in COVID for us is, again, I'm back to what I said in my earlier comments, we were, in March or April of 2020, saying like, \"All right, what do we do? Where do we pivot? How do we retool our sales force, forgetting whatever business is out there?\" And what we found, not surprisingly, is the large corporates disappeared but the SMEs were still out there, maybe not like they are now but they were out there more than others. Why? Because they're small and medium, they had to. Like, they'd die if they -- their business requires it and so they have to be out there. And so we pivoted a whole bunch of our infrastructure and sort of like retooled our entire sales force to make sure that we didn't abandon the large corporates and those relationships. We kept our entire sales team on payroll during the whole crisis which is unlike, I think, a bunch of our competitors. But we did say we need to like reorient how we're focusing our time. And we've done -- with all -- again, I feel like I'm patting us on the back, we've done a really good job. And so we have replaced, we think, probably already half of what that corporate business was that went away. And I think the corporate business is going to come back. You don't have to believe it's all going to come back but the idea is one plus one, I think, can equal three, right? Meaning pivoting even harder to have a larger demand base to put in the top of the funnel of SMEs, along with corporates coming back gradually, is just going to give us an opportunity to price demand in a way that I think will be superior to what we could price it before. Last comment I'd make is that people think about SMEs versus the big corporates and no offense to all the big corporates that are on this call but the reality is you guys pay less. So the SMEs, I mean, if you look at the rate structure of SMEs, it's like 15%-plus on average higher because the big corporates beat us up more, they beat everybody up and we discount more. So the reality is not only is there more of it that's been out there and we've retooled to go after more of it but the reality is it's at a higher price, too. And so that's why I believe in what STR is saying, we're better is because I do think throughout this year, as you release pent-up demand, given our access to SMEs that have been very robust and we have more of them. Corporates are definitely starting to come back, talk to every travel manager in the country which we do and they're coming back. When you put all those pieces together, I think it's pretty easy to believe. As you get to the -- particularly the second half of the year, you're going to be in a very different and a very positive environment.\nRich Hightower: All right, helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichardClarke: Thanks very much for taking my questions. I just want to ask a question about the kind of construction environment. I noticed your percentage of pipeline that's under construction has dropped below 50% for the first time in quite a while. Is that just phasing? And does that feed into this year's guide on unit growth? Or does that mean we maybe can't expect a recovery in 2023 to return to the normal 6% to 7% takes a little bit longer?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Richard, I think, look, that's a slight decrease, almost a rounding error in terms of our amount under construction. It really sort of rounded to half before it rounds to half now. If you look at the industry data per STR, it's down actually a lot more than that. And so we're doing a really good job of both getting and keeping things under construction. And I'd say the way to think about the trajectory is we actually think we'll start more rooms this year than we started last year. Now in the U.S. which is our largest market, we think we have one more year where it's going to decline slightly and 2022 is probably the bottom. And that does play into our forward-looking forecast. And of course, that's just a function of largely input cost, right? If construction costs overall are sort of up year-over-year at the moment in the mid-teens, raw material cost and labor cost inflation is not something that should surprise anybody on this call, that sort of a thing going on globally, especially in the U.S. And so that does all play into our outlook. And so we've actually never said publicly when we think we'll get back to our prior 6% to 7% level. But given what's going on now, it probably takes two or three years to get back to that level, we think. Again, this year we'll be -- 2021 was the bottom globally for starts. This year, 2022 in the U.S., we think we'll recover from there. You've got to start them to deliver them, right? So we have to start to recover to be able to get back to that prior level of net unit growth. And so you are seeing that sort of affect our outlook both for this year and beyond. And then I guess the last thing I'd say on that is, even with everything that's been going on in the world, for now, a two year pandemic with the world blowing sky high, we're still delivering plus-5% net unit growth. We still think we'll deliver at that rate through this development lag that's going to come from the pandemic and then we'll recover from there. We think that's actually pretty good evidence of the resiliency of the business and the resiliency of our ability to grow.\nRichard Clarke: Very helpful. Thanks so much.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavidKatz: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all of the detail so far. I wanted to ask about the aspect of the fees which is non-RevPAR-driven, like your royalties and credit card fees, etcetera. Is there any sort of insights or help that you can offer us as we think about modeling out the next year or two as to what those might grow and any puts and takes?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, David, I think we've talked about this in the past. We get that it's a little bit hard to model sort of specifically what's going on. Our non-RevPAR-driven fees cover a bunch of different things, obviously, our co-brand credit card and our license fees from HGV being the largest part of that but we have other things in there like residential development fees and the like. And we've said this before, that's been less volatile, right? So it declined less than RevPAR declined during COVID. And now at this point, it's growing less than RevPAR. I think for 2021, it grew about 2/3 of the rate of RevPAR and that's probably a decent way to think about it going forward. It's hard to say, right? It depends on how those things perform and what goes on. But I think it's going to continue to be a decent growth rate and additive to our fees. For 2021, it was actually higher, our non-RevPAR fees or I think Chris, you might have said this earlier so sorry if I'm repeating it but our non-RevPAR fees were higher than they were in 2019. And our credit card program is performing quite nicely. I think just a few stats to give you some color. Our account acquisitions were up 45% last year. Our spend was up about 1/3 year-over-year. And so really strong performance but again, at a lower rate than overall RevPAR because RevPAR is growing at a really high rate in recovery. So hopefully...\nDavid Katz: So growth but at a lesser rate?\nKevin Jacobs: At the moment.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobinFarley: Great. Thank you. Originally, my question was going to be to clarify the comments, the opening remarks about transient midweek nights for all future periods down only 4% because that seemed like that number was sort of too strong a recovery. But I guess really based on -- you really already commented already on the growth in the small and medium. So I don't know if you have anything else to add on that, only being down 4%. I would think just even the booking window being shorter would make that hard to be at that good of a number. So I'm thinking...\nChris Nassetta: No, I don't. I don't, Robin, I don't have anything to add other than, yes, it's short. The very nature of advanced bookings and transient only gives you a window so far out in time. It's a relatively short window. But those are the stats. And I gave them to you because I think it is indicative not only of the strength that's building in that environment but the change from literally the beginning of the year when Omicron was a very big thing to a world where Omicron is becoming a lot less of a thing and we're getting to more endemic stages of COVID-19.\nRobin Farley: And then just for a follow-up, if you could put a little more color around -- you mentioned reinstating the dividend in Q2 and returning to share repurchase in Q2. Can you talk about, will you sort of start at a dividend payout or dividend level probably lower than pre pandemic initially? Or just sort of give us some thoughts around how you're thinking about that balance as you restart that return to shareholders.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. As I've said a couple of times, we're intending to do it in Q2. We have not formally declared a dividend so we haven't made a final decision. But I think the way to think about it and our intention at this point is to reinstate the dividend at the exact same level we had it before, same $0.15 a share which is where we were before to go back to where we were and then use the bulk of our free cash flow and otherwise to re-implement our share repurchase program. I know there are different views in the world about this. Our view, my view has always been that having some modest dividend is helpful. It does open the universe of investors up a bit to us and we proved that pre COVID and we've talked to a lot of shareholders and I think still have that view. But the way to drive the best long-term returns for all of us that are shareholders is to have the bulk of our program be in the form of share buybacks. And so that's what we thought pre COVID. We did a whole bunch of work to see, is there anything going on? Jill's nodding her head because she did a lot of it. Is there anything that's changed in the world or with our shareholder base currently that would lead us to a different conclusion? And we have not. We do not believe there is. So that's what we'll do; we'll get started. I think the way to think -- we obviously haven't given guidance generally but I think the way to think about it is we'll start out at least thinking about it at a minimum being the free cash flow that we're going to produce this year. And the way to think about that, I think, directionally is back to my margin point, while we're not back fully recovered by a pretty decent margin yet to 2019, certainly as you look at the full year 2022, because we have -- the business is performing better, we've done these structural things that I described to drive higher margins, our free cash flow is actually pretty much back this year, we think, to 2019 levels. So we'll start at a minimum with that and go from there.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChadBeynon: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I believe your conversion NUG component of total growth has been in the 20% range. Can you help update us on this in terms of where it was for 2021? And then for 2022 against your NUG guide, how should we think about converts and what that will be as a percentage being slightly offset by higher, I guess, ground-up growth?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Thanks, Chad. Look, I think it will be -- I mean, the short answer, the crisp answer is I think it will be consistent, right? It's been about 20%. We're actually doing more conversions. We've given you some of the stats but our approvals, our openings for the full year were up 13% year-over-year. Actually, our approvals for full year last year were up 42% in conversion. So we're having nice growth in conversions and we're doing more but we're also doing more ground-up development, right? And so the denominator in that equation is growing as well. And so will it be slightly higher going for the next couple of years? It could be, depends a little bit on how a couple of big deals break that can move that percentage a little bit here or there. But I would think about it sort of as being pretty consistent around 20% or the low 20s of deliveries. And I think it's actually a good news story across the board. I mean we -- in the Americas, for 2021, we signed almost half of the conversion deals that were done in the Americas. And so we're doing a lot of conversions. But the reason it's not sort of spiking from 20% to 30% is we're delivering a lot of new development as well.\nChad Beynon: Thank you very much.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Thanks very much, everybody, for joining today. Obviously, continuing on with recovery. I think we are, as I've said a couple of times, hopefully, getting through the Omicron variant and very rapidly to an endemic stage of this. We're obviously optimistic as we look to the second quarter and the second half of the year and overall, beyond that. And so thanks for the time. We'll look forward to updating you on trends that, I think, will be a lot better the next time we talk. So, thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Chris and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 104.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. System-wide RevPAR was down 13.5% compared to 2019 as the recovery continued to accelerate across all segments and regions, driven by border reopenings and strong holiday travel demand. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $512 million for the fourth quarter, up 151% year-over-year. Results reflect the continued recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 91%, driven by strong RevPAR improvement and license fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging operating environment and fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Continued cost discipline mitigated segment losses. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.72. Turning to our regional performance. Fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 110% year-over-year and was down 11% versus 2019. The U.S. benefited from strong leisure demand over the holidays, with transient RevPAR 1% above 2019 levels and transient rate nearly 5% higher than 2019 for the quarter. Group business also continued to strengthen throughout the quarter, with December room nights just 12% off of 2019 levels. In the Americas outside of the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR increased 150% year-over-year and was down 17% versus 2019. Continued easing restrictions and holiday leisure demand drove improving trends throughout the quarter. Canada continued to see steady improvement as borders remained open to vaccinated international travelers. In Europe, RevPAR grew 306% year-over-year and was down 25% versus 2019. Travel demand recovered steadily through November but stalled in December as a rise in COVID cases led to reimposed restrictions across the region. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 124% year-over-year and was up 7% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand and the continued recovery of international inbound travel as restrictions eased. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR fell 1% year-over-year and was down 34% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 24% as compared to 2019 as travel restrictions and lockdowns remained in place. However, occupancy in the country held steady versus the third quarter as summer leisure travel was replaced with local corporate and meetings business. The rest of the Asia Pacific region benefited from relaxed COVID restrictions and the introduction of vaccinated travel lanes in several key markets. Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, for the full year, we grew net units 5.6%. Our pipeline grew sequentially and year-over-year, totaling 408,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 61% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. Demand for Hilton-branded properties remains robust and, along with our high-quality pipeline, we are positioned to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $8.9 billion of long-term debt and $1.5 billion in total cash and cash equivalents. We're proud of the financial flexibility we demonstrated through the pandemic and remain confident in our ability to continue to be an engine of opportunity and growth as we look to reinstate our capital return program. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please? Yes. Sure, Joe. I'll take this one. I think it's interesting. I'm not exactly sure what numbers you're looking at. I think our split between managed and franchised, as the pipeline plays out, has been pretty consistent, right? Our existing supply is 75% franchised led by the U.S. and the Americas, of course. But more and more, our pipeline today is 40% franchised outside -- in -- sorry, 40% franchised in EMEA and nearly half franchised in APAC as our franchisee business grows in those regions. And so over time, what had been happening is growing outside the U.S., more of those deals had been managed and that was sort of skewing us back towards managed. And now I'd say we're on a trajectory overall. We'll still add a bunch of managed rooms as we grow outside the U.S. but more and more, we're doing franchising outside of the U.S. And so maybe I'm missing something in your question and I'm happy to do a follow-up but I think that's been pretty consistent and not really moving around that much. And then, interestingly -- and so feel free to follow up. But to get to China, it's interesting. Most of the development trends and I think we've said this on prior calls, have been following the trend of the virus. So meaning, as the world's been opening up in those regions, you see a pretty direct correlation to signing activity and approval activity in those regions, so led by the U.S. Europe had sort of a slow start this year but then really came on towards the end of the year as things start to open up. China has been kind of the exception to that rule, meaning even with lockdowns and people not moving around and you would think not being able to travel across the country, would slow the pace of activity but that just hasn't been the case. So for us, we -- our approvals for 2021 were up 45% for the year and our openings were up 30% over the year. And we think our openings will be up something similar to that over the course of 2022. So China has really been strong, led by our Plateno-Hampton JV. We've now launched Home2 with Country Garden. We've now launched on our own -- an individual franchising program for Hilton Garden Inn, with still a bunch of, Chris mentioned a little bit in our prepared remarks, still a bunch of really great full-service and luxury signings along the way. So China has been a little bit of the exception to the rule with COVID where even in the face of lockdowns, we've had a lot of activity. Yes. I'd probably just add to that quickly on the real estate is like you're making a comment about the mix of business but you should remember that the real estate has been shrinking over time. And even though you've had -- you've got different rates of recovery in COVID and different mix, over time, that is going to continue to be a smaller part of the business as we continue to grow the managed and franchised business and continue to work our way out of the risk. Yes. Good question, Steve and a little bit to unpack there but I'll sort of try to go in order. I think if you'd take a step back to the beginning of the pandemic, I think we've done a really good job leading -- we did a really good job in the pandemic leading the way with starting out early on, advocating for our owners, whether that was for government assistance or otherwise, being really flexible with standards as the business sort of fell apart a little bit. And through recovery, sort of similar to what Chris has been talking about of really taking the opportunity of COVID to drive improvement through our enterprise, we've been doing the same thing at the property level, right? So it's certain big things you mentioned by being innovative with reengineering our food and beverage and particularly, breakfast offerings, looking at housekeeping and opt-in there and then a bunch of little things across line item by line item sort of literally grinding through the P&Ls and standards with our owners to help them -- help the properties be more profitable through COVID and using that opportunity to make sure that, that profitability and those efficiencies stand going forward. Now people talk about we do need service recovery, right? It has been hard to hire labor. We do need to bring some of those service standards back. Obviously, everybody knows what's going on with inflation and wage inflation. But of course, the flip side of that on inflation is that helps on the revenue line, right? We reprice the rooms every night. If inflation is a headwind, on the cost side, it's going to be a tailwind on the revenue side and the revenue base is obviously bigger than the expense base. And so that ought to lead to higher margins coming out the other side. So when you put that all together, we think we can do a better job for customers, give them what they want, take away what they don't want and what they won't pay for and use driving revenue through an inflationary environment to get our owners to be higher-margin businesses coming out the other side. Sure. Good morning. Yes. I think I'll start with the second part. I mean really, there's nothing different about our franchise agreements now versus pre COVID. It's a very well -- it's a business that's been around for a long time. The protocols are established, the franchise documents, you can read them, they're public. They haven't really changed over time. I think when it comes to key money, I mean, you could see in our numbers this year that it's been sort of higher than it had been in the past. I think that's a function of a little bit of -- I don't think it's COVID versus pre COVID. It's a competitive environment out there so there's definitely competition. We're leading the way in growth and our competitors are trying to catch up to us. So that makes for competition. But the reality is, is our number of deals that have key money associated with them is about 10%. That's what it was pre COVID. That's what it is today. So that's been pretty consistent. And we've just been fortunate, over the last particularly a year or so, we've signed some really high-profile deals. I think about the Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach in California. I think about Resorts World in Las Vegas, the deal we did in Cancun and Tulum, those have been deals that we've been working on for a really long time. They're very strategic. They happen to be a little bit higher key money associated with them than we're used to and so we've been a little bit higher. And that trend maybe continues for a little while longer. We have some strategic things in the hopper at the moment that I think might keep that number a little bit elevated over the course of 2022 and maybe even for a little while beyond that. But what I'd say sort of in closing and hopefully, that sort of covers it and Chris may want to add to this a little bit, is relative to our peers, I think we stack up really favorably in terms of what we've been deploying for capital to get to our level of growth, I think, has been exemplary. Yes. Richard, I think, look, that's a slight decrease, almost a rounding error in terms of our amount under construction. It really sort of rounded to half before it rounds to half now. If you look at the industry data per STR, it's down actually a lot more than that. And so we're doing a really good job of both getting and keeping things under construction. And I'd say the way to think about the trajectory is we actually think we'll start more rooms this year than we started last year. Now in the U.S. which is our largest market, we think we have one more year where it's going to decline slightly and 2022 is probably the bottom. And that does play into our forward-looking forecast. And of course, that's just a function of largely input cost, right? If construction costs overall are sort of up year-over-year at the moment in the mid-teens, raw material cost and labor cost inflation is not something that should surprise anybody on this call, that sort of a thing going on globally, especially in the U.S. And so that does all play into our outlook. And so we've actually never said publicly when we think we'll get back to our prior 6% to 7% level. But given what's going on now, it probably takes two or three years to get back to that level, we think. Again, this year we'll be -- 2021 was the bottom globally for starts. This year, 2022 in the U.S., we think we'll recover from there. You've got to start them to deliver them, right? So we have to start to recover to be able to get back to that prior level of net unit growth. And so you are seeing that sort of affect our outlook both for this year and beyond. And then I guess the last thing I'd say on that is, even with everything that's been going on in the world, for now, a two year pandemic with the world blowing sky high, we're still delivering plus-5% net unit growth. We still think we'll deliver at that rate through this development lag that's going to come from the pandemic and then we'll recover from there. We think that's actually pretty good evidence of the resiliency of the business and the resiliency of our ability to grow. Sure. Yes, David, I think we've talked about this in the past. We get that it's a little bit hard to model sort of specifically what's going on. Our non-RevPAR-driven fees cover a bunch of different things, obviously, our co-brand credit card and our license fees from HGV being the largest part of that but we have other things in there like residential development fees and the like. And we've said this before, that's been less volatile, right? So it declined less than RevPAR declined during COVID. And now at this point, it's growing less than RevPAR. I think for 2021, it grew about 2/3 of the rate of RevPAR and that's probably a decent way to think about it going forward. It's hard to say, right? It depends on how those things perform and what goes on. But I think it's going to continue to be a decent growth rate and additive to our fees. For 2021, it was actually higher, our non-RevPAR fees or I think Chris, you might have said this earlier so sorry if I'm repeating it but our non-RevPAR fees were higher than they were in 2019. And our credit card program is performing quite nicely. I think just a few stats to give you some color. Our account acquisitions were up 45% last year. Our spend was up about 1/3 year-over-year. And so really strong performance but again, at a lower rate than overall RevPAR because RevPAR is growing at a really high rate in recovery. So hopefully... At the moment. Yes. Thanks, Chad. Look, I think it will be -- I mean, the short answer, the crisp answer is I think it will be consistent, right? It's been about 20%. We're actually doing more conversions. We've given you some of the stats but our approvals, our openings for the full year were up 13% year-over-year. Actually, our approvals for full year last year were up 42% in conversion. So we're having nice growth in conversions and we're doing more but we're also doing more ground-up development, right? And so the denominator in that equation is growing as well.

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. As our results show, we made significant progress in our recovery throughout 2021. We saw a meaningful increase in demand for travel and tourism and our team members around the world were there to welcome guests with our signature hospitality as they look to reconnect and create new memories. We continued to demonstrate our resiliency by remaining laser-focused on providing reliable and friendly service to our guests and by launching several new industry-leading offerings to provide them even more choice and control. We also continued to expand our global footprint, adding even more exciting destinations to our portfolio and achieving a record year of room openings. All of this, together with our resilient business model, translated into solid results. For the full year, we grew RevPAR 60% and adjusted EBITDA 93%. Both RevPAR and adjusted EBITDA were approximately 30% below 2019 peak levels. More importantly, our margins were 500 basis points above 2019 peak levels, reaching roughly 66% for the full year. While some costs will come back in as we continue to recover, we remain extremely focused on cost discipline. Given our asset-light business model and the actions we took during the pandemic to further streamline our operations, we expect permanent margin improvement versus prior peak levels in the range of 400 to 600 basis points over the next few years. Turning to results for the quarter. RevPAR increased 104% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was up 151%. RevPAR was roughly 87% of 2019 levels with ADR nearly back to prior peaks. Compared to 2019, occupancy improved versus the third quarter with higher demand across all segments. Strong leisure over the holiday season drove U.S. RevPAR to more than 98% of 2019 levels for December. Business travel also improved sequentially versus the third quarter, with solid demand in October and November before the Omicron variant weighed on recovery in December. For the quarter, business transient room nights were approximately 80% of 2019 levels. Group RevPAR improved 11 percentage points over the third quarter to roughly 70% of 2019 levels. Performance was largely driven by strong social business, while recovery in company meetings and larger groups continued to lag. As we kicked off the new year, seasonally softer leisure demand, coupled with incremental COVID impacts due to the Omicron variant, tempered the positive momentum we saw through much of the fourth quarter. For January, system-wide RevPAR was approximately 75% of 2019 levels. Despite some near-term choppiness, we remain optimistic about accelerated recovery across all segments throughout 2022. We anticipate strong leisure trends to continue again this year, driven by pent-up demand and nearly $2.5 trillion of excess consumer savings. Our revenue position for Presidents' weekend is seven percentage points ahead of 2019 levels. And our position for weekends generally is up significantly for the year, both indicating continued strength in leisure travel. Similarly, we expect growth in GDP and nonresidential fixed investment, coupled with more flexible travel policies across large corporate customers to fuel increasing business transient trends. As a positive indication of business transient recovery, at the beginning of January, midweek U.S. transient bookings for all future periods were down 13% from 2019 levels and improved to just down 4% by the end of the month. Additionally, STR projects U.S. business transient demand will return to 92% of pre-pandemic levels in 2022. On the group side, our position for the year is to remain steady as Omicron-related disruption was largely contained to the first quarter of 2022 with most events rescheduled for later in the year. We continue to expect meaningful acceleration in group business in the back half of the year as underlying group demand remains strong. Compared to 2019, our tentative booking revenue was up more than 25%. Additionally, meeting planners are increasingly more optimistic with forward bookings trending up week over week since early January. Overall, we remain very confident in the broader recovery and our ability to keep driving value on top of that. This should allow us to generate strong free cash flow growth and our expectation is to reinstate our quarterly dividend and begin buying back stock in the second quarter. Turning to development. We opened more than a hotel a day in 2021, totaling 414 properties and a record 67,000 rooms. Conversions represented roughly 20% of openings. We achieved net unit growth of 5.6% for the year, above the high end of our guidance and added approximately 55,000 net rooms globally, exceeding all major branded competitors. Our outperformance reflects the power of our commercial engines, the strength of our brands and our disciplined and diversified growth strategy. Fourth quarter openings totaled more than 16,000 rooms, driven largely by the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. In the quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 400th hotel in China and our first Home2 Suites in the country. This positive momentum continued into the new year with the highly anticipated opening of the Conrad Shanghai just last month, marking the brand's debut in one of the world's busiest and most exciting markets. During the quarter, we also continued the expansion of our luxury and resort portfolios with the opening of the Conrad Tulum and the new all-inclusive Hilton Cancun. With more than 400 luxury and resort hotels around the world and hundreds more in the pipeline, we remain focused on growing in these very important categories. We were also thrilled to welcome guests to the Motto New York City Chelsea, a major milestone for this quickly growing brand and a perfect addition to Hilton's expanding lifestyle category. This hotel exemplifies what it means to be a lifestyle property. It incorporates unique and modern design elements and provides guests with authentic and locally minded experiences. We also celebrated the first lifestyle property in Chicago with the opening of the Canopy Chicago Central Loop and debuted the brand in the U.K. with the opening of the Canopy London City. These spectacular properties joined recently opened Canopy hotels in Paris, Madrid and Sa\u0303o Paulo. In 2021, we grew our Canopy portfolio by more than 1/3 year-over-year, opening hotels across all major regions. We ended the year with 408,000 rooms in our development pipeline, up 3% year-over-year, even after a record year of openings. Our pipeline represents an industry-leading 38% of our existing supply, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit net unit growth for the next couple of years and eventually return to our prior 6% to 7% growth range. For this year, we expect net unit growth to be approximately 5%. As our guests' travel needs continue to evolve, we again introduced innovative ways to enhance the guest experience. In the quarter, we announced the launch of Digital Key Share which allows more than one guest to have access to their room's digital key via the Hilton Honors app. To further reward our most loyal Hilton Honors members, we introduced automated complimentary room upgrades, notifying eligible members of upgrades 72 hours prior to arrival. With our guests at the heart of everything we do, we've been thrilled to hear that the early feedback for both industry-leading features has been overwhelmingly positive. In the quarter, Hilton Honors membership grew 13% year-over-year to more than 128 million members. Honors members accounted for 61% of occupancy in the quarter, just a few points below 2019 levels and engagement continued to increase across members of all tiers. We work hard to ensure that our hospitality continues to have a positive impact on the communities we serve. For that reason, we're incredibly proud to be recognized for our global leadership in sustainability. For the fifth consecutive year, we were included on both the World and North America Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, the most prestigious ranking for corporate sustainability performance. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made over the last year and I'm very confident that Hilton is better positioned than ever to lead the industry as we enter a new era of travel. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on the quarter. Morning, John. Yes, I'm happy to do it. We put it in the comments because the truth is it's, I would argue, very important. I don't think it's had a lot of focus and it has an intense amount of focus inside this company amongst the management team and, for that matter, with our Board of Directors because the idea was, as you would want to do in any crisis, is take advantage of opportunity. And as we went into the crisis, we saw things that we thought we've not only needed to do to address the crisis but we could do to make the business stronger. And so we didn't obviously have a lot to worry about liquidity. We had a lot to worry about but our balance sheet is great. We didn't have a lot of liquidity issues. So we very quickly, not to pat us on the back but it's true. Like in March, April of 2020, we were focused on recovery, how do we get to the other side, what are the things that we can do to make this business faster growing, better, stronger and higher margin. And we've been at it ever since and we'll never stop because we think there are opportunities. I think if you did the math, it sort of comes in three categories that gets you there. Number one, we're bigger. So you have units that have been added at plus 5% a year through COVID that haven't been, during COVID, that productive that are, over the next few years, going to become productive contributors to earnings. We've had great success in our sort of license arrangements and sort of our non-RevPAR-related fee segment of the business. So think our HGV business, think our Amex co-brand business generally where we -- it's a very, very high-margin business and it has performed very well. If you look at the numbers carefully, 2021, we were already over peak levels for those fees -- peak '19 -- 2019 levels and we think there's still meaningful growth to come from that. And then last but not least and importantly, cost structure. We, like everybody, every business that was dramatically impacted by COVID, had to think about cutting costs in hotels and in corporate and we did that. But again, not patting us on the back but reality, we said, like, we don't want to just take cost out. We want to sort of reengineer the way we run the business to be able to -- where we think there might be longer-term efficiencies, realize those and during COVID sort of get -- build it into the DNA of the company. And so we were able to take out a bunch of costs that helped during COVID but that we think we will be able to keep out. When you put all that together, as we said, we think it's 400 to 600 basis points of sort of a real run rate margin improvement. We delivered pretty well against, I thought, last year when we had RevPAR and EBITDA that was 30% off of peak levels and delivering 500 basis point margin levels was pretty compelling as a down payment on what we're saying. Now it won't be a perfectly straight road, meaning there are -- last year, we probably underspent in some areas because it's been hard to hire and all that, corporately. This year, we'll catch up a little bit with that. So it won't be a completely straight line. But as you look out to like '23 and '24, I think we're in those target ranges, hopefully at the midpoint or beyond those, at least as we model it. And as I said, it's not by happenstance, it's not by luck. It's been a huge focus and I think shareholders should feel comfortable that it will remain an intense focus of the enterprise because we know we can. And if we can, we should because ultimately and I won't finish this because I'm sure others have questions that we want to have answered ultimately. Obviously, we're a free -- when we -- in a normal time, we're a free cash flow machine. The higher the margins, the higher the free cash flow and having 500 basis point higher margins allows us to drive a lot more free cash flow that allows us to return a lot more capital over time. And as I said in my prepared comments, we intend to start returning capital in the second quarter. That is the second quarter of this year, that is six weeks from now. Good morning, Joe. I have no earthly idea. As you know, we haven't been giving guidance for any period of time, let alone for 2024. So Thomas, I think the best thing to do is let my comments stand as they were. We're confident that on a run rate basis, it will sort of be in that range. We're very proud of that, of being able to accomplish that. Obviously, we're always looking to under-promise and over-deliver; so that will never change but not much to add at this point. I'm not sure I understand but I think so. Yes. I mean we have confidence -- said another way, just to be clear, we have confidence that the structural changes we have made to the company on a like-for-like basis are going to drive higher margins. So if you think that margins were going to continue to grow organically under the prior setup, then we agree with that and we think that there's an incremental piece to it that is a result of structural changes that we've made that we'll maintain. Yes. And not to beat a dead horse but just throw something slightly more on top of the real estate. The real estate, you're right, is a lower-margin business by definition. We have baked that into what we -- what our guidance -- what my summary was of what our expectation is over the next few years. So that was taken into account. It also, from an EBITDA growth point of view, will be tremendously helpful because it was so beat up, given the structure of how much of it is held that from an EBITDA growth rate point of view over the next few years, real estate is going to be very, very helpful, very high growth. Yes. I think China, I'm doing this from memory, I think China '19 was like five points of EBITDA overall. And I would guess at this point, it is less than half of that. So I'm looking at Jill. It's probably 2% or something like that. So I think you're right. There's a significant -- I mean, by the way, that's true for the entire international estate when you think about it. Our Asia Pacific business, our Europe business, they've all been slower to return. And so our EBITDA, if you look at '20 and '21, was crazy disproportionately U.S.-based and those numbers aren't fully back to where they were. I mean we were like 73% U.S. I think in 2020, we were like 94% or 95% and last year, we were like 83% or something. So it's coming back and will ultimately return to a more normalized kind of environment which means not just China but the whole world. The whole world outside of the U.S. has some significant growth potential as we get to a more normalized environment. In terms of the regions generally and I'll end on China and maybe use this as an opportunity to just talk about sort of the rhythms of what's going on, most of which I think is pretty well known because you guys have a lot of data. But if you look at what's going on in the world, the Middle East which is not a huge part of our business, is sort of leading the world. I mean you saw our numbers for the fourth quarter. Middle East is already meaningfully above 2019 levels, so they're sort of ahead in recovery. We think that will continue. The U.S., I would say, is sort of next and we can -- maybe I'll leave it to another question. Our belief is you will see, in the second quarter, a transition and then very rapid recovery, all our earlier prepared comments, in the second half of the year. I think Europe will be quick to follow in the sense that it's more complicated because you have more countries, the restrictions aren't just one set of restrictions but you can start to see it sort of sweeping through Europe opening, sweeping through Europe. Now Asia Pacific, I think, will lag in large part because of China and the policies they've had. My own view and that's all it is. It's not because of insider knowledge is that as the rest of the world opens and as you get which I think we are rapidly approaching to an endemic stage of COVID, I think there'll be a lot of pressure economically, culturally and otherwise for China to open up much like the rest of the world. So I think it will be -- it will lag but I think it will be -- I think Europe and then Asia will be a fast follow. And as I think we -- as we -- my own view as we get to the second half of the year, I think you're in an entirely different environment across the globe. And in the first half of the year, you're going to see things evolving at a slightly different pace. But I think when you get to the second half of the year, every -- the whole world broadly is going to be a lot more open than anything we've seen in two years. Good morning. Yes. I -- yes, it is in our forecast but I do buy into it. And I think actually, it might be even better than that personally, my own opinion. I think there's a really good chance, on a run rate basis, that we will end up back at or above where we were in 2019 before the year is out. So why do I think that? One, there's a lot of pent-up demand. That obviously helps and Omicron created more pent-up demand because a lot of people didn't do trips. But I can't speak for the industry. I can speak for us. We're out talking to customers all the time, sort of large, medium, small. And what you find is like heretofore during the crisis, the largest corporate customers have been way off on travel. So they've been like 80 -- well, I'd say through the third and fourth quarter, they were 70% or 80% off still. But what happened is that SME, small, medium enterprises were out traveling like crazy. I've given these stats before on calls. Pre COVID, 80% of our business transient was SMEs. 20% of it or 10% of the overall business was large corporate. So it's not that we don't love them and we don't want them but we were never ultimately that dependent on that. So what happened in COVID for us is, again, I'm back to what I said in my earlier comments, we were, in March or April of 2020, saying like, \"All right, what do we do? Where do we pivot? How do we retool our sales force, forgetting whatever business is out there?\" And what we found, not surprisingly, is the large corporates disappeared but the SMEs were still out there, maybe not like they are now but they were out there more than others. Why? Because they're small and medium, they had to. Like, they'd die if they -- their business requires it and so they have to be out there. And so we pivoted a whole bunch of our infrastructure and sort of like retooled our entire sales force to make sure that we didn't abandon the large corporates and those relationships. We kept our entire sales team on payroll during the whole crisis which is unlike, I think, a bunch of our competitors. But we did say we need to like reorient how we're focusing our time. And we've done -- with all -- again, I feel like I'm patting us on the back, we've done a really good job. And so we have replaced, we think, probably already half of what that corporate business was that went away. And I think the corporate business is going to come back. You don't have to believe it's all going to come back but the idea is one plus one, I think, can equal three, right? Meaning pivoting even harder to have a larger demand base to put in the top of the funnel of SMEs, along with corporates coming back gradually, is just going to give us an opportunity to price demand in a way that I think will be superior to what we could price it before. Last comment I'd make is that people think about SMEs versus the big corporates and no offense to all the big corporates that are on this call but the reality is you guys pay less. So the SMEs, I mean, if you look at the rate structure of SMEs, it's like 15%-plus on average higher because the big corporates beat us up more, they beat everybody up and we discount more. So the reality is not only is there more of it that's been out there and we've retooled to go after more of it but the reality is it's at a higher price, too. And so that's why I believe in what STR is saying, we're better is because I do think throughout this year, as you release pent-up demand, given our access to SMEs that have been very robust and we have more of them. Corporates are definitely starting to come back, talk to every travel manager in the country which we do and they're coming back. When you put all those pieces together, I think it's pretty easy to believe. As you get to the -- particularly the second half of the year, you're going to be in a very different and a very positive environment. No, I don't. I don't, Robin, I don't have anything to add other than, yes, it's short. The very nature of advanced bookings and transient only gives you a window so far out in time. It's a relatively short window. But those are the stats. And I gave them to you because I think it is indicative not only of the strength that's building in that environment but the change from literally the beginning of the year when Omicron was a very big thing to a world where Omicron is becoming a lot less of a thing and we're getting to more endemic stages of COVID-19. Yes. As I've said a couple of times, we're intending to do it in Q2. We have not formally declared a dividend so we haven't made a final decision. But I think the way to think about it and our intention at this point is to reinstate the dividend at the exact same level we had it before, same $0.15 a share which is where we were before to go back to where we were and then use the bulk of our free cash flow and otherwise to re-implement our share repurchase program. I know there are different views in the world about this. Our view, my view has always been that having some modest dividend is helpful. It does open the universe of investors up a bit to us and we proved that pre COVID and we've talked to a lot of shareholders and I think still have that view. But the way to drive the best long-term returns for all of us that are shareholders is to have the bulk of our program be in the form of share buybacks. And so that's what we thought pre COVID. We did a whole bunch of work to see, is there anything going on? Jill's nodding her head because she did a lot of it. Is there anything that's changed in the world or with our shareholder base currently that would lead us to a different conclusion? And we have not. We do not believe there is. So that's what we'll do; we'll get started. I think the way to think -- we obviously haven't given guidance generally but I think the way to think about it is we'll start out at least thinking about it at a minimum being the free cash flow that we're going to produce this year. And the way to think about that, I think, directionally is back to my margin point, while we're not back fully recovered by a pretty decent margin yet to 2019, certainly as you look at the full year 2022, because we have -- the business is performing better, we've done these structural things that I described to drive higher margins, our free cash flow is actually pretty much back this year, we think, to 2019 levels. So we'll start at a minimum with that and go from there. Thanks very much, everybody, for joining today. Obviously, continuing on with recovery. I think we are, as I've said a couple of times, hopefully, getting through the Omicron variant and very rapidly to an endemic stage of this. We're obviously optimistic as we look to the second quarter and the second half of the year and overall, beyond that. And so thanks for the time. We'll look forward to updating you on trends that, I think, will be a lot better the next time we talk. So, thanks and have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin. \nJill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.\n In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.\n This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our third quarter results. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. \n With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris. \nChristopher Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report another quarter of very solid results that demonstrate continued recovery and the resiliency of our business model. \n Increases in vaccination rates and consumer spending, coupled with improving business activity, continued to drive solid travel demand throughout the summer and into the fall. As global borders reopen and the travel environment recovers, we remain extremely encouraged by people's desire to travel and connect more than ever before. \n In the third quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 99% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down roughly 19%, improving 17 percentage points versus the second quarter, with system-wide rates down just 2.5% versus 2019. Adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $519 million, up 132% year-over-year and down 14% versus 2019. Performance was primarily driven by strong leisure trends with leisure room nights roughly in line with 2019 level, with leisure rates exceeding 2019 levels. \n Business travel continued to gain momentum with midweek occupancy and rates improving meaningfully versus the second quarter. In the quarter, business transient room nights were roughly 75% of prior peak levels. Group continued to lag but showed significant sequential improvement versus the second quarter, boosted by strength in social events. For the quarter, group RevPAR was approximately 60% of 2019 levels, improving 21 percentage points from the second quarter.\n Overall system-wide RevPAR versus 2019 peaked in July at 85% with rates just shy of prior peaks. As expected, recovery slowed modestly later in the quarter due to typical seasonality and customer mix shift, but overall trends remained solid. Both August and September RevPAR achieved roughly 80% of 2019 levels, driven by continued strength in leisure and upticks in business travel post-Labor Day as offices and schools reopen. These trends improved modestly into October with month-to-date RevPAR at approximately 84% of 2019 levels and rates in the U.S. nearly back to prior peaks. Roughly 40% of system-wide hotels have exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in October month-to-date. \n Additionally, bookings for all future periods are just 8% below 2019. With loosening travel restrictions and strong nonresidential fixed investment forecast, we remain optimistic for future travel demand.\n TSA reported third quarter travel numbers were nearly 80% of 2019 with demand picking up further following the announcements of the U.S. border reopening and the lift of the international travel ban for vaccinated travelers. Additionally, studies show that nearly 70% of U.S. businesses are back on the road, up 28 points from the end of the second quarter. With roughly 80% of our typical corporate mix coming from small- and medium-sized businesses and with the lagging recovery of larger corporate travel, we've taken the opportunity to continue our work from before COVID to further increase our focus on this segment of demand. This demand is higher rated, the more resilient -- resilient, which has helped us recover more quickly in business transient and should drive rate compression in the future as larger corporate travel picks up. \n On the group side, our position for the rest of the year remains fairly steady with forward booking sentiment improving as variant concerns taper. Additionally, the recent reopenings of some of our large urban properties, like the New York Hilton Midtown, increased our confidence in our positioning as group recovers. \n Turning to development. We added nearly 100 hotels and 15,000 rooms across all major regions and delivered strong net unit growth of 6.6% in the third quarter. Conversions represented roughly 1/3 of openings. Year-to-date, we've added more than 42,000 net rooms globally, higher than all our major branded competitors. \n Our performance reflects the success of our disciplined growth strategy, the strength of our brands, network effect and commercial engines across the world. It also illustrates our increasing confidence in a strong recovery in global tourism in the months and years to come. \n During the quarter, we launched our large-scale franchise model in China, enabling independent owners to explore franchising opportunities with our Hilton Garden Inn brand with a prototype developed specifically for the Chinese market. To date, we have signed more than 100 deals to develop Hilton Garden properties in China, strengthening our confidence in the long-term growth of our focused service brands and our ability to cater to a growing middle class. \n Following our recently announced exclusive license agreement with Country Garden, we were thrilled to open our first Home2 Suites in China with plans to grow to more than 1,000 properties. We look forward to leveraging our partnership to capture the rapidly growing demand for mid-scale hotels in China. \n We also celebrated the opening of our 500th Home2 Suites following the brand's launch just 10 years ago, making it one of the fastest-growing brands in industry history and boasting the industry's largest pipeline in North America with more than 400 hotels in development. \n Our luxury and lifestyle footprints also continued to expand globally with the debut of the Canopy by Hilton in Spain and the highly anticipated opening of the Mango House LXR in the Seychelles. Marking another important milestone in its global expansion, LXR celebrated its debut in Asia Pacific with the opening of the ROKU KYOTO. \n In the quarter, we signed nearly 24,000 rooms, up approximately 40% year-over-year, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. Driving our positive momentum in luxury, we announced the signing of the Conrad Los Angeles, the brand's first property in California. The 300-room hotel is expected to open in 2022 as part of The Grand LA mixed-use development. With approximately 404,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction, we expect positive development trends to continue, driven by both new development and conversion opportunities. For the full year, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the next several years. \n For our guests, flexibility has always been important, but the pandemic has made choice and control even more critical. We were excited to launch several new commercial programs and loyalty extensions, including the launch of Digital Key Share, a first for a major hospitality company. This feature allows more than one guest to have access to their room's digital key. \n Additional technology enhancements have enabled our elite Honors members to begin enjoying automatic room upgrades. Gold and Diamond members may be notified of a complementary upgrade prior to arrival, enabling guests to choose their upgraded room directly by using the Hilton Honors app. We continue to focus on new opportunities to further engage our 123 million Honors members and are thrilled to see engagement is nearly back to 2019 levels. In the quarter, membership grew 11% year-over-year. Honors members accounted for 59% of occupancy with the U.S. at 66%, just 2 points below 2019 levels. \n During the pandemic, approximately 23 million U.S. households brought home a new pet, including my own. And like so many others, my family loves traveling with our new dog, Miller. In the coming months, Homewood Suites will join Home2 in becoming 100% pet-friendly in the U.S. with plans for all limited service brands to be pet-friendly by the first quarter of next year. And thanks to our exciting partnership with Mars Petcare, we're offering new pet-focused programming and benefits. Our guests are eager to travel with their furry little friends. And by making that simpler, we're able to capture demand and bring new business into the system. \n As the global travel environment improves, I continue to be impressed by our team members' dedication to providing exceptional experiences to our guests. That's why I am particularly proud that, last week, we were named the #3 World's Best Workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work. After 6 consecutive years of being ranked, Hilton was the only hospitality company on the list. We truly believe that Hilton continues to be an engine of opportunity for all of our stakeholders around the world and are very optimistic for the future. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results in the quarter. \nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 98.7% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the recovery continued to accelerate, driven by strong leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. and across Europe. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 18.8% compared to 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was $519 million in the third quarter, up 132% year-over-year. Results reflect the broader recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 93%, driven by strong RevPAR improvement and Honors license fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio performed better than expected in the third quarter, driven by the accelerating recovery in Europe, the Tokyo Olympics and ongoing cost controls. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $0.78. \n Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 105% year-over-year and was down 14% versus 2019. Robust leisure demand and improving business transient trends drove strong performance in July. Trends modestly slowed later in the quarter due to seasonality. U.S. occupancy averaged nearly 70% for the quarter with overall rate largely in line with 2019 levels. \n In the Americas outside the U.S., third quarter RevPAR increased 168% year-over-year and was down 30% versus 2019. The region benefited from easing travel restrictions and strong leisure demand over the summer period. Canada also saw a noticeable step-up in demand in August after reopening their borders to vaccinated Americans. \n In Europe, RevPAR grew 142% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019. Travel demand accelerated across the region in the third quarter as vaccination rates increased and international travel restrictions loosened. \n In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 110% year-over-year and was down 29% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand and international inbound travel from Europe. \n In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR grew 5% year-over-year and was down 41% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 25% as compared to 2019 as a rise in COVID cases led to reimposed restrictions and lockdowns across the country. China has recovered steadily into October with occupancy nearing 60% for the month. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, prolonged lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand offset upside from the Tokyo Olympics. \n Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we grew net unit 6.6%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 404,000 rooms at the end of the quarter with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Development activity continues to gain momentum across the globe as the recovery progresses, a testament to the confidence owners and developers have in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands. For the full year, we now expect signings to increase in the mid- to high teens range year-over-year and expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%. \n Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of long-term debt and $1.4 billion in total cash and cash equivalents. We're proud of the financial flexibility we demonstrated over the past 18 months. And looking ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet management as we continue to progress through the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage. \n Further details on our third quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions]\n Chad, can we have our first question, please? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. \nCarlo Santarelli: Chris, you gave a lot of color, as did you, Kevin, in your prepared remarks. But one thing I just wanted to kind of ask around was how you guys are seeing or believe the cadence of business transient travel will play out here in the fourth quarter and how kind of -- or how you're thinking about the sequencing through 2022? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean great question, Carlo, and obviously one everybody is interested in. So maybe I'll talk about all the segments a little bit because it's hard to do one without the others. So as you know, to grossly oversimplify, which you know I like to do occasionally, the way I would see it is, as we have been seeing through the third quarter and what I think we'll see in the fourth quarter is a continued uptick in business transient travel, I think that will come from all segments of business strange. But again, probably continue to be led this -- in this year in the fourth quarter by small and medium SME, small and medium enterprises. I don't think you'll see a huge pickup, but I think you'll see a modest pickup. \n At the same time, just because people are increasingly back in offices and kids are definitely, mostly, if not entirely, back in school, I think you'll see a little bit of a tick-down in leisure business. Now the weekends will continue to rage, I think. The weekends have been extraordinary, but the midweek leisure travel will continue to tick down. And I think those 2 will largely offset each other in the fourth quarter. \n I think group will remain pretty consistent. Obviously, we had a big uptick in the summer, and then Delta variant sort of slid out the momentum a little bit on group. People think -- there's advanced planning. People have to spend money. And so while there's plenty of group occurring, it's really largely sports and social. At this point, I think that continues about -- like what we've seen in the third quarter into the fourth because people are -- all the pent-up demand is there, but people are sort of advanced planning more into next year, just to sort of finally get through Delta and hopefully to the endemic stage of COVID, which sort of feels like is we're in the process of doing as we speak. \n As we think about 2022 with all those segments, what I would say is I think leisure will remain elevated relative to historical standards. Obviously, my belief is kids will still be back in school. More offices are going to open. So midweek, we'll get back to more normalized levels. But I think the weekends, people want to be out. Turns out they didn't like being locked in their closets and basements and attics, and so they're going to want to get out. And we've seen this pattern of very high demand on weekends. I think that will continue. And so I think on the margin, leisure will be -- continue to be stronger than we've historically seen sort of in pre-COVID times. \n I think business transient will continue to move up. You'll continue to see great strength in small and medium enterprises, which aren't fully back to pre-COVID but getting pretty close. And my own belief is you'll start to see the large corporates step into the game. I mean they're already in the game, but they're still sort of like 40% off of '19 levels. I think you'll see a step change in the large corporates which will contribute, along with SMEs, to continued upticks in business transient.\n And then I think group is clearly going to be better next year than this year. I think reality is the first quarter probably is typically a slow group quarter. I don't think it will be different in that way. I think people are going to want to sort of clear the mechanism of getting past the winter, just because concerns of flu seasons and all that, given what we've all been through. But I think as you get into Qs 2, 3 and 4, both booked business and realized business on the group side are going to be better. \n So I think 2022 is sizing up to be -- I think the fourth quarter is sizing up to be fairly similar to the third quarter, and I think 2022 is sizing up to be another big step forward on recovery to more normalized times. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. \nJoseph Greff: You guys were -- had some interesting comments on the development side, and obviously positive there. Chris, when do you think hotel construction starts to trough? When do you think new signings peak or have they? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Another we've spent a lot of time looking at that through the last couple of quarters and very recently. Here's what I'd say. I gave you a sense, so I won't repeat what both Kevin and I said about NUG. Kevin, we both talked about it this year. I gave you a sense in our prepared comments that we think we'll be in the mid-single-digits for the next couple of years. Obviously, that requires a lot of work. It requires signing deals, starting construction that then ultimately it lands in our NUG numbers.\n I think when you look back 2 years from now at this period of time, I am of the mind and reasonably confident that what you will see is the trough in deal signings was last year. As Kevin mentioned, we're going to be up in the mid- to high single-digits in signings this year, we think. I mean we're not done with the year. We always have a good flurry of activity at the end, but we got a lot of it on the books, and so we're pretty damn confident we're going to be up nicely. And I don't see why next year, given what's going on in the environment in terms of -- particularly operating recovery, pricing power, which I'm sure we'll come to, I'll do it maybe in another question, that we're going to see more deals signed next year. \n So I think last year was probably, in my mind, the trough for signings. I think this year, for those same exact reasons, will be the trough in construction starts. Starts always will lag the signings a little bit. We're definitely going to be a little bit modestly down in signings this year after being down last year. Our expectation is that will turn around next year, and that's why we think we'll be sort of in the mid-single-digits for a couple of years and then back on track being in the 6% to 7% range, just because, starting this year, we're signing more. Starting next year, we're starting more. We're obviously filling in a lot. You saw in the second quarter, 1/3 of our NUG was conversion, so we're filling in. And so between all of those factors, we think, ultimately, when we get out past a couple of years, we're back. The goal is to be back in the 6% to 7%. And I think given what I see in the environment that we feel pretty good about that. \n I mean -- and I'll probably stop there with the only comment being things are going to come back faster than prior recoveries here, and that's because the thing that's very different than every other cycle I've seen in my 40 years, and I'll leave it at this, and somebody, I'm sure, will have a question, is just pricing power. I mean the reality is, typically, it's like a grind to build back occupancy, and rate lags significantly. Rate is leading the charge, and that, obviously, flows really nicely. We've done a bunch of things, as you know, and we've talked about a lot to create higher-margin businesses out of all of these brands. And when you flush all that through, even with labor costs up and all of those fun things, these are higher-margin businesses. And part of this is just we're in an inflationary environment. And guess what? We can reprice our product every second of every day. We're a very good hedge in that way to inflation, and we're being very thoughtful about how we're pricing our product. \n And so I think when we all look back on it, this will be a faster recovery on the development side than we've seen in prior cycles. And -- so I think we're going to be back in -- on a very nice trajectory next year. \nOperator: The next question will be from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. \nShaun Kelley: Chris, I think there were a couple of fat pitches there on the pricing environment, so maybe I'll behave, if you could. But I guess my twist would be could you give us a little color specifically on the business pricing side? I think we all see that the leisure rates are exceptional. And so maybe your thoughts on how long leisure can continue pricing like it is, your thoughts on the recovery of business pricing. And then any headwind from large corporates? You've done a great job of delineating small and large, so how much of a headwind is large corporate? Does that price any differently? Is that a factor at all? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. A great question. Yes, I did sort of serve that up. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised I'm getting asked. Listen, you embedded in the question is part of the answer. But obviously, we feel -- first of all, let me not be pedantic but say what I say a lot when I'm asked this question. The laws of economics are alive and well, right? And that's what's going on. Why is leisure so strong in rate? Why are we able to price above historically high levels? Because there are crazy amounts of demand. Like our weekend demand is off the chart. We're running 85% to 90% system-wide in the U.S. on the weekends, and we're pricing over '19 levels, obviously, because we have a lot of demand. \n I do think that will -- that leisure pricing power will continue because, what I said before, I believe that leisure demand is going to remain at elevated levels, particularly on the weekends, and that that's going to give us nice pricing power. Even though, obviously, the recovery in business transient has lagged, as I said in the quarter, we were 75%, but it's sort of a tale of 2 cities, which is I implied it a little bit. You have -- the big corporates which are still 40% off, but then you have small and medium which are only maybe 10%. You could even argue maybe 5% or 10% off. And so we have a fair amount of pricing power in the biggest piece -- in the biggest segments, and they are less price sensitive. \n So broadly, your biggest -- it's not everybody. Your biggest corporate customers can end up with sort of off bar, 10% or 20%. Small and medium might end up at 5% or 7%. So that's why we were working so hard on accessing more of that demand base pre-COVID and has helped us during COVID. \n And so when you put it all together and you look at like even in the quarter, we're at 90% of -- in business transient combined, we're already at 90% of 2019 levels, even though we still have a ways to go to build back demand. So I feel -- it's a long ways to go. I feel pretty good about where that's going because we're going to keep pushing on small and medium. That's almost back. My guess is that will exceed prior levels. And then the corporates are going to come in. And that's going to allow us to put more on the top of the funnel to price -- have more demand, allows us to price more aggressively. \n I think when it's all said and done, if we were 80-20 before, and I don't know exactly where it will be, but my suspect we will probably never go back to 80-20 in reality because we have been successful at finding other segments that we think are going to be there. They're going to be more resilient, and they're going to be higher priced. So my guess is we will be managing to probably a 90-10 world or something like that. But we do think pricing power is not in business transient what it is in leisure, but it's not far off. \n And then group, group is sort of in the year, for the year similar to business transient. But as you look forward, because there's so much pent-up demand, and as I've talked about at least on the last call, we're actually pricing already over '19 levels. So there's pricing power. And you'd say, well, \"Wow, if group is still way off from a consumer revenue point of view, what's going on?\" Well, what's going on is group is very -- the one segment that books weigh in advance, and there's a limited amount of meeting space in the world and in the United States. We happen to have a lot of it. I mean there are a few of us that are very big players in that space. A lot of people want it. And so the reality is, again, laws of economics are alive and well. People want it. There's not enough of it. You have huge pent-up demand that's sort of getting all -- events that didn't happen, that need to happen, new events. And that's pushing into next year. \n And so even though, in the moment, group revenues aren't what they were, on a forward-looking basis, there is a good amount of pricing power, which is why on a -- all of our advanced bookings in the next year are pricing over '19 levels at this point. \n So again, back to the bait I put out there, I guess, it's unusual. Like I hate to admit how long I've been doing this but a long time. I guess I said it before. But it just hasn't really happened this way. Now there are a lot of reasons. We're better, right? We got much more sophisticated revenue management systems. We're much more on top of it, I think, than we've ever been. Obviously, we're in a more inflationary environment broadly. Thank you, Federal Reserve and the U.S. Congress, for fiscal and monetary stimulus. We could debate transitory or otherwise, but those things are translating into, broadly, a more highly inflationary environment. And that applies to us, too, and that obviously is helping from a pricing power point of view. \nOperator: The next question will be from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. \nThomas Allen: So a strategic question. You talked in your prepared remarks about starting to open franchising for Hilton Garden Inn in China. I know that was an interesting change because with Hampton Inn, you did a master franchise agreement. Can you just talk about the rationale? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. It's very straightforward. We've done 2. The one you mentioned with Plateno was the Hampton Inn. And then more recently, I mentioned in my comments, we just actually opened our first Home2 Suites by Hilton in China on the road to doing 1,000 of them with Country Garden, one of the largest players in China, which is another master license agreement. So we've done those 2. \n Never say never. I'm not saying -- but the idea was to really help -- get help from very large local players that knew how to garner scale very quickly to help build our network effect in China and then ultimately come back in with our other brands and do it ourselves. And so that's exactly what we're doing with Hilton Garden Inn. We obviously have a massive franchise system here in the United States and frankly in Europe now, where the bulk of the business here is franchised. Increasingly, I think we're now -- the majority of the business in Europe is franchised. It's been a much smaller part of the business in China and in Asia Pacific, so we historically haven't had the same level of resources. \n And so what we've done during COVID is made some strategic investments to build out more infrastructure so that we can take other brands in our -- of our 18 brand -- a family of brands and do it ourselves. \n And so we're trying to be very sort of balanced and balance all the risks associated with our expansion around the world, and we think it's great to work with third parties. We love the Country Garden folks and Plateno. They've been incredibly important partners, will continue to be for a long, long time. But it's also important that we have that skill set ourselves in franchising. Is it -- while it's similar in China, it's not exactly the same. And so we've learned a lot and I think built a -- we're building a good infrastructure and a good muscle set to be able to take a bunch of other brands and do just what we've done here in the U.S., Europe and other places. \nThomas Allen: And sorry, just a follow-up to this question. Any updated thinking on the potential TAM for these select service brands in China? \nChristopher Nassetta: I didn't hear the question. \nThomas Allen: How many of these hotels do you think you can open in China? What's the addressable market? \nChristopher Nassetta: TAM. Okay, you're going tech on me. I love that. I love that. We do look at TAM. I mean I'm not going to give you there. It's thousands, right? Think of it in the following way. We have limited service hotels in the U.S., probably 4,500. We have a population of 320 million people. You have 1.3 billion people there, so there's no limit in my lifetime at least, probably not, you're younger than me, but I'm not that old, so probably not in your lifetime either. Thousands and thousands. You could easily have 10,000 or 20,000 or more, so I think there's growth opportunities in the mid-market as far as the eye can see in China. \n So while we have done some TAM work in China every time we come back and look at the numbers, they're just -- they're off the charts. There are no rational limitations given what our footprint is, what the population is and the growth in their middle class. \nOperator: Next question will be from Smedes Rose from Citi. \nBennett Rose: Chris, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what your owners are telling you about labor costs in the U.S. Kind of how they're handling restaffing and maybe just the sort of idea of slim down the operating models versus trying to get back to... \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Smedes, I had a hard time hearing some of that, but I think I captured it, the labor costs and what owners are telling us. It's obviously been a big issue and one that we spent a lot of time on, a complex issue in terms of what's sort of underneath the problem. \n What I would say is, obviously, there is no one owner group. The different owners in different parts of the country and the world, for that matter, have different views. But if I sort of homogenize it all, which is hard to do, but if I do it in my head, I would say while it's still a very difficult issue, we've started to see easing in terms of access to labor. I think we have ways to go. There are a bunch of things we're doing to help from a technology point of view to access pools of labor that maybe we hadn't accessed historically. But broadly, more labor is coming back in, and some of those pressures are easing. Obviously, labor is more expensive pretty much everywhere. I think that's a reality. Where it settles out, I think it's a little early to know, but I think it is sort of settling down as people are gradually coming back into the workforce. \n I think the end of the question, which is a really important one, which I sort of touched on earlier in one of my other filibusters, was how is it going to look for owners on the other side? And again, it's hard -- some owners -- depends on location, product, 1,000 factors. But broadly -- and we're already seeing it. I think I said this. Broadly, I think when we get to the other side of this, across the system, margins are going to be higher, and you know why. With input costs going up, labor costs going up and all of those fun things, they're going to be -- margins are going to be higher because rate is going to be a lot higher ultimately when we get past this for all the reasons I talked about in terms of the pricing power that we have and the broader inflationary environment. That's very helpful to the business. \n At the same time, particularly in the mega categories, which is where the bulk of the hotels are with our ownership community, we did a bunch of really important work and did a lot of testing and learning and made a bunch of changes in the hotels. In the end, we think, to create a better experience for our customers, but to do it in a more efficient way to drive higher margins. So we're pretty confident. And we have pretty good evidence, which I'll talk about that, even with the -- when labor comes back and you have to pay labor more, given where rate structures are going to be in most places and given the efficiencies that we've been able to garner, that these are -- our owners are going to end up with higher-margin businesses. \n And by the way, many, many of them, not all of them. So for those that haven't gotten there that are listening, keep the faith. But many, many owners are already there. Some of it is unsustainable, meaning part of it is they can't get enough labor, and so they don't have enough people, so their labor costs are unusually low. But even in places where they are able to get the labor back for the reasons I described, meaning more efficiencies on our standards and pricing power on the top line, they're driving very good margins. \n And so we've had -- the owners are -- have been in pain. I don't want to minimize it. There's still many of them in a lot of pain, but we're doing our level best to get them to the other side and make sure their businesses are stronger, both because that's what we should do, as a fiduciary to them, but also, ultimately, if we want to continue to be able to grow, we have to give them an investment alternative that continues to makes sense from a return point of view. And so we're hyper focused on it. \n And I would say, I feel really good. As I said, I think the development cycle will flip faster than we've seen in prior cycles for these reasons. I just think that the economics -- the laws of economics are alive and well. I've said it now twice or three times, that if people can get great returns because of the conditions, macro and micro, macro world going on micro the things we're doing, then they're going to want to build us more hotels. And obviously, with the signings being up in the mid -- double -- mid-teens to plus, we think that's pretty good prima facie evidence that that's what's going on. \nOperator: And the next question will be from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. \nBennett Rose: This is a bit of a multi-parter, but you mentioned that the majority of the pipeline is outside the U.S. Can you just remind us of what that split maybe looks like within some of the major markets? How the contribution from international room growth could compare and contrast to the U.S. as we translate NUG to fees? And then if you could just talk to any kind of incremental signing opportunities that you're seeing that surfaced in new markets as a result of the pandemic that could be longer lasting. \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Stephen. It's Kevin. I'll sort of try to take those in order. I think that the mix of rooms under construction is just over -- so kind of between 60% and 65% outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S. I think in terms of -- look, we're always trying to enter new markets. I think we have 20 something -- 25 to 30 new countries embedded in the pipeline that we don't have today, right? So we're always trying to enter new markets. I'm not sure really anything of that -- any of that has been opened up by the pandemic. I think it's just sort of the course of the growth of our business over time.\n And then trajectory really has a lot to do with how places are coming out of the pandemic, meaning we've been -- even though there's been spikes up and down in RevPAR in China, for instance, as they go into lockdowns, the development trajectory there has actually continued to be pretty solid and continued to improve. But in places like Europe where, traditionally, it's more of a face-to-face development environment, the less people have been able -- the less our teams and the owners have been able to get on planes and move around country to country, those signings have lagged a little bit. So I actually see that as a tailwind coming out of the pandemic, whereas there's a lot of pent-up demand for development in EMEA broadly. And I think that it's just going to require a little bit more mobility to surface that. \n But the rest of it is just, over time, as Chris has talked about this, as you have a rapidly developing middle class with more demand for mid-market products, you're going to see a little bit more of that demand over time. I mean the full-service business is not dead by any means. But you're just going to see, on the margin, the capital flows more to the limited-service hotels. So we're going to do more deals where the capital flows. \n And then as we bring franchising, which has been very successful for us -- Chris went through it, so I won't go through it again. But as we bring franchising to different parts of the world, particularly Asia Pacific, we're just going to do more franchise deals over time. You're not going to see, I don't think, big step changes. You're just going to see a gradual growth over time in more limited-service mix and more franchise mix. Did that cover all the parts? \nStephen Grambling: One very quick follow-up. So from a net unit growth standpoint then, I guess, the fees that you're getting from the international market maybe ends up being a little bit lower because of the RevPAR. But on the flip side, it sounds like you're doing more direct, so there's a potential for that to actually improve within that mix. Is that true? \nKevin Jacobs: Well, yes. Mathematically, right, the lower price points, it will blend in over time. Again, it will not change dramatically. We've modeled it every which way, and it's really hard to make that per room number move. But mathematically, it has to move over time. And the reality is, look, it's very high margin. It's 100% margin. Once we have scale in these parts of the world, it's a 100% margin and infinite yield. And so we'll take it. \nOperator: The next question will be from Robin Farley with UBS. \nRobin Farley: Great. A lot of my questions have been asked already. One, just to circle back, and I hope I didn't miss this in the opening comment. I -- the operator pulled me out of the call for a minute. But when you talked about group and the expectation that there'll be a lot of pent-up volume for '22, can you give us a sense of where -- and I think that is a reasonable expectation but kind of where the group on the books for next year is versus '19. Like in other words, it's likely to be higher or maybe not in Q1, but kind of how that's pacing with what you have on the books for group for '22. And I don't know if you have it by quarter or first half, second half. \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean it would be weighted to Qs 2 through 4, first of all, for the reasons I covered in a prior answer. Just meaning people want to get through the winter, one. Two, the first quarter is never a big group quarter. So you put those 2 things together, and it trends heavily to Qs 2, 3 and 4. \n We're in the 75%, 80% on the books, which is about consistent with where we were in the last quarter. And what happened is, I think if you hadn't had the Delta variant spike, we'd probably be somewhat further along. But you had the Delta variant sort of slow -- they cooled off the advanced bookings on the group side, which have now picked back up. \n The other thing going on, of course, is we want to -- we do believe there's going to be a lot of group potential, particularly in Qs 2, 3 and 4. And we don't want to commit. There's a level of -- lack of desire on our part to commit too much space when we know that there'll be a lot of pricing power, so it's sort of a bit of a delicate balancing act. \nOperator: And the next question will be from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. \nRichard Clarke: I just noticed on your cost reimbursement revenue has exceeded your -- the cost reimbursement expense for the first time really since the pandemic began. And you've lost obviously -- non-underlying, but you've lost about sort of $500 million through that Delta as the pandemic has gone on. Is this the beginning potentially of you being able to claw that back? And could this be a sort of boost to cash flow over the next few quarters? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Richard. It's -- I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a clawback. I think what happened early in the pandemic is you had sort of -- rough numbers, you had revenue go down kind of 85% to 90% overnight. And we did a really good job of taking the expenses down, but we can only take expenses down, call it, 60% or 65%. So we basically were funding from our balance sheet the -- all the commercial engines and the websites and all the funded part of the business. And so those things really are giant co-ops. They're going to break even over time. \n So now what you're seeing is revenues -- and by the way, all the fees, all the sources of funds for those programs are funded as a percentage of revenue. So as revenue is climbing, our receipts are going up. And we will ultimately bring those funds back to breakeven, and we will recover those deficits. And at the moment, you're seeing it as surpluses. But I wouldn't necessarily think of it as clawbacks. Those funds run surpluses and deficits from time to time. So I think you'll see it run a surplus for a little while. And yes, the cash is commingled. But it's our owner's money at the end of the day, and we spend it all on them. \nOperator: Next question will be from Bill Crow from Raymond James. \nWilliam Crow: Chris, I hope you don't mind. I'm going to challenge you a little bit on the leisure outlook for 2022. And I'm just wondering how much risk there really is when we think about the combination of the return to office, the absence of government checks, much higher costs from inflation for the consumer and probably a pretty considerable pent-up outbound international demand. So I'm thinking about your comments on rate and leisure and weekday leisure in particular. Are we at risk kind of setting ourselves up for disappointment next year? \nChristopher Nassetta: I don't think so. You heard my views, so you can -- we can have a debate about it, but I don't think so for the following reason. I think the midweek is already being bled out now, so I don't -- I think most people -- most kids are back in school. It's in truncate's mobility even if people are in the office, so while more offices are going to open through the rest of this year and into next year. What we've seen in the pattern of leisure during the midweek, it's our -- we've sort of washed out a large part of that already. I may be wrong, but I believe the weekends are going to remain strong, simply because I still think, if you look at the $3 trillion of incremental savings during COVID, there's a long way to go to spend it all. And I think people still want to do -- they want the experiences that they were starved for, and now it gets concentrated more on weekends, which is what we're seeing now. I believe that will continue. \n I don't -- so the net of it is, my view, just to be clear, is that relative to a normalized like '19 level of leisure demand, I think we're getting back more towards that with a little bit better because I think the weekends are going to be a little bit better. I'm not -- I agree with you. I don't think that the midweek leisure is going to be raging, and that's not sort of built into my expectations.\n In terms of outbound, yes, the world is opening up. But then there's inbound, too. Particularly for the cities that -- the big cities, top 25 markets that historically depend on 20% of their business from inbound international travel, they've had 0. And starting next week or week after, the floodgates are going to open on that. So yes, you're going to have some people going outbound, but you're going to have a lot of people that want to come see America that is going to offset that and particularly with the top 25 markets, broadly, but particularly in the top 25 markets that are going to come in. \n Again, we're still in the middle of budgets, and we're still debating all of this and where it ends up. There's -- I'm giving you my opinion and my sense of it. I think leisure will remain -- when we wake up next year and the following year, and you compare it to the amount of leisure business that we did, which was probably 25% or 30% of our overall segmentation pre-COVID, I think it will be higher than that. And I think it will be higher than that because people want to get out more. There's plenty of incremental savings in the world that has not gotten anywhere close to being spent. And the weekend business, while we were doing better on weekends than we had historically, I think it will stay even more elevated than that. \nWilliam Crow: Great. And Chris, can I give you the opportunity to maybe update us on the timing for potential capital returns and buybacks? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. We don't have anything new. But to repeat what I said last time, we are very interested in getting back to returning capital. We firmly believe in our capital allocation strategy pre-COVID, which was we were producing a lot of free cash flow that we didn't -- we can continue to grow the business in an industry-leading way without the use of much of it. And we wanted, as a result, to give it back to our shareholders because there was no reason for us to hoard it or do dumb things with it. And disciplined capital allocation, we believe, is a hallmark of long term, delivering great returns for shareholders. \n Our -- my belief hasn't been changed through COVID. The only thing that changed is we didn't have a lot of free cash flow during the heat of the crisis. We are obviously getting past that. We are cash flow positive. We want to just give it a little bit more time, as I said on the last call, sort of finish out the year. And if things go as we expect and consistent with what we have been seeing, we're going to reinstate a return of capital program in the first half of next year. And my guess is it will look quite similar. I mean, we're still having that discussion with our Board who obviously has a say in it. But I think if I had to pick a line, I think it will look a lot like what we were doing pre-COVID. And we're very focused on it and very anxious to get back to it. And so I direct you, I would say first half of next year. \nOperator: The next question will be from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. \nCharles Scholes: A question on labor costs and specifically Hilton Corporation's labor costs. Any change in your expectations for G&A and trajectory of your G&A versus what you said in the past? And correct me if I'm wrong, I have in my notes here. You've talked about sensitivity of EBITDA to RevPAR, EBITDA growth about 1.3x RevPAR growth. Is that still your thoughts on that trajectory? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I think what we said, Patrick, is that in the context of when RevPAR levels are elevated, the RevPAR growth is elevated the way it is, it will be in that zone. I think it should be -- obviously 90% of the business is from fees, that should be about 1:1 as things normalize. We think we can do a little bit better with net unit growth, cost discipline, license fees, things like that, maybe a little bit better than 1:1 over time. But I think the 1.3x is more of when RevPAR is elevated. \n And then no change -- short answer is no change in our views on G&A, right? We've been very disciplined. I think we -- what we've said to you guys is that cash G&A ought to be down this year in the mid- to high teens from 2019 levels. We actually might do a little bit better than that this year because we've got pretty good cost discipline. GAAP is different, but you got a lot of moving pieces. Particularly in the third quarter this year, we're lapping over some of the write-downs of stock comp from last year.\n And then going forward, again, no real change. I think we all understand that, with more business activity is going to come a little bit more expense. And just like we're in an inflationary environment that's going to help on the revenue side, we're going to be paying people a little bit more along the way. But we do think we're going to maintain discipline. The changes that we've made to our structure are going to hold going forward, and we feel -- still feel the same way. \nOperator: The next question will be from Vincent Ciepiel (sic) [ Vince Ciepiel ] with Cleveland Research Company. \nVince Ciepiel: Great. Question on distribution. You guys have done a nice job driving direct business with, I think, loyalty contribution around 60% pre-COVID. But I know OTA contribution fell from high teens to about low doubles while reducing commissions along that path, so a lot of exciting things happening on the distribution front. I'm curious, on the other side of this, how you're thinking about OTA contribution as well as how high that loyalty contribution can get. \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, really good question. I don't feel really a lot different than I did pre-COVID. I mean we believe there's an efficient frontier, and we've calculated it as best we can by individual market property, what -- based on what they can deliver at that price point versus what we can deliver, how do we deliver the highest index -- the highest revenue for the lowest distribution cost. And we do believe, and that's why we've had a good relationship with the OTAs, that they play a part in that. It's traditionally been in the sort of 10% or 12% range, and that's historically where we've been. During COVID, that went up. \n But if -- we wanted it to go up. We partnered, I think, quite successfully with our OTA partners, knowing that the biggest segment of demand that was out there for most of COVID was lower-rated leisure, which is what they are particularly good at, non-loyalty -- nonloyal-type customer base. And so it has crept -- it crept up a bit but not too terribly much, and we've already seen that sort of peak and start to come down. \n And so while we'll look at the efficient frontier as we always do periodically and maybe if you think leisure is going to be a little bit higher component overall, maybe it goes up a little, but not much, and it didn't move that much. So the net of all that is I think when we wake up in a couple of years, it will look an awful lot like it did before. And we obviously feel good about the contractual terms that we have with the OTAs now and our ability to continue to have attractive terms going forward. \n As it relates to Honors, the -- my Honors team is probably listening, and they may need a diaper for this. But we're -- we maxed out in the 63%, 64% system-wide. And we're already in the U.S., as I mentioned in my prepared comments, not that far off of that. Globally, we're coming back as our more of -- number one, we've accessed more travelers that weren't loyal. So some of these leisure travelers that we didn't have access to, we've now accessed. And more of our core customer is getting back on the road. We're getting back to normal. \n But I'm not going to put a number out there because I'll give a heart -- my team will have a heart attack. But I believe that there is a lot of room to grow. I think the super majority -- if we're doing our job, the super majority of our customers want to be Honors members. It's a proposition that they get benefits that you just don't get, and they're meaningful. And you can go through them. They get discounts. They get technology. They get experiences money can't buy. They get points that are currency. They can shop on Amazon and Lyft and buy tickets at Live Nation. And there is no reason, as we continue coming out of this, to actively engage with our customer base, where it shouldn't be -- we shouldn't be able to push it meaningfully higher than where we kept -- where we maxed out before. \n Now that will take time. And so to my Honors team, don't freak out. We're going to give you the time. But our goals there, which I'm not going to state publicly, are meaningfully higher than where we were, which, by the way, is meaningfully higher than any of our competitors already. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks. \nChristopher Nassetta: Thanks, everybody, for the time today. I know it's a busy earnings season. We're obviously quite pleased given what we've all lived through over the last 20 months to be able to report the progress that we were able to report for the third quarter. As you could tell from the call, I remain quite optimistic about where this recovery is going and what the opportunities are in the industry but particularly for our business and the growth of our business. And we'll look forward to reporting fourth quarter and full year after the New Year. Look forward to seeing many of you while we're out on the road. And have a terrific day and holiday, if I don't see you. \nOperator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 98.7% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the recovery continued to accelerate, driven by strong leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. and across Europe. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 18.8% compared to 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was $519 million in the third quarter, up 132% year-over-year. Results reflect the broader recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 93%, driven by strong RevPAR improvement and Honors license fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio performed better than expected in the third quarter, driven by the accelerating recovery in Europe, the Tokyo Olympics and ongoing cost controls. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $0.78. \n Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 105% year-over-year and was down 14% versus 2019. Robust leisure demand and improving business transient trends drove strong performance in July. Trends modestly slowed later in the quarter due to seasonality. U.S. occupancy averaged nearly 70% for the quarter with overall rate largely in line with 2019 levels. \n In the Americas outside the U.S., third quarter RevPAR increased 168% year-over-year and was down 30% versus 2019. The region benefited from easing travel restrictions and strong leisure demand over the summer period. Canada also saw a noticeable step-up in demand in August after reopening their borders to vaccinated Americans. \n In Europe, RevPAR grew 142% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019. Travel demand accelerated across the region in the third quarter as vaccination rates increased and international travel restrictions loosened. \n In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 110% year-over-year and was down 29% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand and international inbound travel from Europe. \n In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR grew 5% year-over-year and was down 41% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 25% as compared to 2019 as a rise in COVID cases led to reimposed restrictions and lockdowns across the country. China has recovered steadily into October with occupancy nearing 60% for the month. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, prolonged lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand offset upside from the Tokyo Olympics. \n Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we grew net unit 6.6%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 404,000 rooms at the end of the quarter with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Development activity continues to gain momentum across the globe as the recovery progresses, a testament to the confidence owners and developers have in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands. For the full year, we now expect signings to increase in the mid- to high teens range year-over-year and expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%. \n Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of long-term debt and $1.4 billion in total cash and cash equivalents. We're proud of the financial flexibility we demonstrated over the past 18 months. And looking ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet management as we continue to progress through the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage. \n Further details on our third quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions]\n Chad, can we have our first question, please? Yes, Stephen. It's Kevin. I'll sort of try to take those in order. I think that the mix of rooms under construction is just over -- so kind of between 60% and 65% outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S. I think in terms of -- look, we're always trying to enter new markets. I think we have 20 something -- 25 to 30 new countries embedded in the pipeline that we don't have today, right? So we're always trying to enter new markets. I'm not sure really anything of that -- any of that has been opened up by the pandemic. I think it's just sort of the course of the growth of our business over time.\n And then trajectory really has a lot to do with how places are coming out of the pandemic, meaning we've been -- even though there's been spikes up and down in RevPAR in China, for instance, as they go into lockdowns, the development trajectory there has actually continued to be pretty solid and continued to improve. But in places like Europe where, traditionally, it's more of a face-to-face development environment, the less people have been able -- the less our teams and the owners have been able to get on planes and move around country to country, those signings have lagged a little bit. So I actually see that as a tailwind coming out of the pandemic, whereas there's a lot of pent-up demand for development in EMEA broadly. And I think that it's just going to require a little bit more mobility to surface that. \n But the rest of it is just, over time, as Chris has talked about this, as you have a rapidly developing middle class with more demand for mid-market products, you're going to see a little bit more of that demand over time. I mean the full-service business is not dead by any means. But you're just going to see, on the margin, the capital flows more to the limited-service hotels. So we're going to do more deals where the capital flows. \n And then as we bring franchising, which has been very successful for us -- Chris went through it, so I won't go through it again. But as we bring franchising to different parts of the world, particularly Asia Pacific, we're just going to do more franchise deals over time. You're not going to see, I don't think, big step changes. You're just going to see a gradual growth over time in more limited-service mix and more franchise mix. Did that cover all the parts? Well, yes. Mathematically, right, the lower price points, it will blend in over time. Again, it will not change dramatically. We've modeled it every which way, and it's really hard to make that per room number move. But mathematically, it has to move over time. And the reality is, look, it's very high margin. It's 100% margin. Once we have scale in these parts of the world, it's a 100% margin and infinite yield. And so we'll take it. Yes, Richard. It's -- I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a clawback. I think what happened early in the pandemic is you had sort of -- rough numbers, you had revenue go down kind of 85% to 90% overnight. And we did a really good job of taking the expenses down, but we can only take expenses down, call it, 60% or 65%. So we basically were funding from our balance sheet the -- all the commercial engines and the websites and all the funded part of the business. And so those things really are giant co-ops. They're going to break even over time. \n So now what you're seeing is revenues -- and by the way, all the fees, all the sources of funds for those programs are funded as a percentage of revenue. So as revenue is climbing, our receipts are going up. And we will ultimately bring those funds back to breakeven, and we will recover those deficits. And at the moment, you're seeing it as surpluses. But I wouldn't necessarily think of it as clawbacks. Those funds run surpluses and deficits from time to time. So I think you'll see it run a surplus for a little while. And yes, the cash is commingled. But it's our owner's money at the end of the day, and we spend it all on them. Yes. I think what we said, Patrick, is that in the context of when RevPAR levels are elevated, the RevPAR growth is elevated the way it is, it will be in that zone. I think it should be -- obviously 90% of the business is from fees, that should be about 1:1 as things normalize. We think we can do a little bit better with net unit growth, cost discipline, license fees, things like that, maybe a little bit better than 1:1 over time. But I think the 1.3x is more of when RevPAR is elevated. \n And then no change -- short answer is no change in our views on G&A, right? We've been very disciplined. I think we -- what we've said to you guys is that cash G&A ought to be down this year in the mid- to high teens from 2019 levels. We actually might do a little bit better than that this year because we've got pretty good cost discipline. GAAP is different, but you got a lot of moving pieces. Particularly in the third quarter this year, we're lapping over some of the write-downs of stock comp from last year.\n And then going forward, again, no real change. I think we all understand that, with more business activity is going to come a little bit more expense. And just like we're in an inflationary environment that's going to help on the revenue side, we're going to be paying people a little bit more along the way. But we do think we're going to maintain discipline. The changes that we've made to our structure are going to hold going forward, and we feel -- still feel the same way."

            "name": "Christopher Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report another quarter of very solid results that demonstrate continued recovery and the resiliency of our business model. \n Increases in vaccination rates and consumer spending, coupled with improving business activity, continued to drive solid travel demand throughout the summer and into the fall. As global borders reopen and the travel environment recovers, we remain extremely encouraged by people's desire to travel and connect more than ever before. \n In the third quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 99% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down roughly 19%, improving 17 percentage points versus the second quarter, with system-wide rates down just 2.5% versus 2019. Adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $519 million, up 132% year-over-year and down 14% versus 2019. Performance was primarily driven by strong leisure trends with leisure room nights roughly in line with 2019 level, with leisure rates exceeding 2019 levels. \n Business travel continued to gain momentum with midweek occupancy and rates improving meaningfully versus the second quarter. In the quarter, business transient room nights were roughly 75% of prior peak levels. Group continued to lag but showed significant sequential improvement versus the second quarter, boosted by strength in social events. For the quarter, group RevPAR was approximately 60% of 2019 levels, improving 21 percentage points from the second quarter.\n Overall system-wide RevPAR versus 2019 peaked in July at 85% with rates just shy of prior peaks. As expected, recovery slowed modestly later in the quarter due to typical seasonality and customer mix shift, but overall trends remained solid. Both August and September RevPAR achieved roughly 80% of 2019 levels, driven by continued strength in leisure and upticks in business travel post-Labor Day as offices and schools reopen. These trends improved modestly into October with month-to-date RevPAR at approximately 84% of 2019 levels and rates in the U.S. nearly back to prior peaks. Roughly 40% of system-wide hotels have exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in October month-to-date. \n Additionally, bookings for all future periods are just 8% below 2019. With loosening travel restrictions and strong nonresidential fixed investment forecast, we remain optimistic for future travel demand.\n TSA reported third quarter travel numbers were nearly 80% of 2019 with demand picking up further following the announcements of the U.S. border reopening and the lift of the international travel ban for vaccinated travelers. Additionally, studies show that nearly 70% of U.S. businesses are back on the road, up 28 points from the end of the second quarter. With roughly 80% of our typical corporate mix coming from small- and medium-sized businesses and with the lagging recovery of larger corporate travel, we've taken the opportunity to continue our work from before COVID to further increase our focus on this segment of demand. This demand is higher rated, the more resilient -- resilient, which has helped us recover more quickly in business transient and should drive rate compression in the future as larger corporate travel picks up. \n On the group side, our position for the rest of the year remains fairly steady with forward booking sentiment improving as variant concerns taper. Additionally, the recent reopenings of some of our large urban properties, like the New York Hilton Midtown, increased our confidence in our positioning as group recovers. \n Turning to development. We added nearly 100 hotels and 15,000 rooms across all major regions and delivered strong net unit growth of 6.6% in the third quarter. Conversions represented roughly 1/3 of openings. Year-to-date, we've added more than 42,000 net rooms globally, higher than all our major branded competitors. \n Our performance reflects the success of our disciplined growth strategy, the strength of our brands, network effect and commercial engines across the world. It also illustrates our increasing confidence in a strong recovery in global tourism in the months and years to come. \n During the quarter, we launched our large-scale franchise model in China, enabling independent owners to explore franchising opportunities with our Hilton Garden Inn brand with a prototype developed specifically for the Chinese market. To date, we have signed more than 100 deals to develop Hilton Garden properties in China, strengthening our confidence in the long-term growth of our focused service brands and our ability to cater to a growing middle class. \n Following our recently announced exclusive license agreement with Country Garden, we were thrilled to open our first Home2 Suites in China with plans to grow to more than 1,000 properties. We look forward to leveraging our partnership to capture the rapidly growing demand for mid-scale hotels in China. \n We also celebrated the opening of our 500th Home2 Suites following the brand's launch just 10 years ago, making it one of the fastest-growing brands in industry history and boasting the industry's largest pipeline in North America with more than 400 hotels in development. \n Our luxury and lifestyle footprints also continued to expand globally with the debut of the Canopy by Hilton in Spain and the highly anticipated opening of the Mango House LXR in the Seychelles. Marking another important milestone in its global expansion, LXR celebrated its debut in Asia Pacific with the opening of the ROKU KYOTO. \n In the quarter, we signed nearly 24,000 rooms, up approximately 40% year-over-year, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. Driving our positive momentum in luxury, we announced the signing of the Conrad Los Angeles, the brand's first property in California. The 300-room hotel is expected to open in 2022 as part of The Grand LA mixed-use development. With approximately 404,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction, we expect positive development trends to continue, driven by both new development and conversion opportunities. For the full year, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the next several years. \n For our guests, flexibility has always been important, but the pandemic has made choice and control even more critical. We were excited to launch several new commercial programs and loyalty extensions, including the launch of Digital Key Share, a first for a major hospitality company. This feature allows more than one guest to have access to their room's digital key. \n Additional technology enhancements have enabled our elite Honors members to begin enjoying automatic room upgrades. Gold and Diamond members may be notified of a complementary upgrade prior to arrival, enabling guests to choose their upgraded room directly by using the Hilton Honors app. We continue to focus on new opportunities to further engage our 123 million Honors members and are thrilled to see engagement is nearly back to 2019 levels. In the quarter, membership grew 11% year-over-year. Honors members accounted for 59% of occupancy with the U.S. at 66%, just 2 points below 2019 levels. \n During the pandemic, approximately 23 million U.S. households brought home a new pet, including my own. And like so many others, my family loves traveling with our new dog, Miller. In the coming months, Homewood Suites will join Home2 in becoming 100% pet-friendly in the U.S. with plans for all limited service brands to be pet-friendly by the first quarter of next year. And thanks to our exciting partnership with Mars Petcare, we're offering new pet-focused programming and benefits. Our guests are eager to travel with their furry little friends. And by making that simpler, we're able to capture demand and bring new business into the system. \n As the global travel environment improves, I continue to be impressed by our team members' dedication to providing exceptional experiences to our guests. That's why I am particularly proud that, last week, we were named the #3 World's Best Workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work. After 6 consecutive years of being ranked, Hilton was the only hospitality company on the list. We truly believe that Hilton continues to be an engine of opportunity for all of our stakeholders around the world and are very optimistic for the future. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results in the quarter. Yes. I mean great question, Carlo, and obviously one everybody is interested in. So maybe I'll talk about all the segments a little bit because it's hard to do one without the others. So as you know, to grossly oversimplify, which you know I like to do occasionally, the way I would see it is, as we have been seeing through the third quarter and what I think we'll see in the fourth quarter is a continued uptick in business transient travel, I think that will come from all segments of business strange. But again, probably continue to be led this -- in this year in the fourth quarter by small and medium SME, small and medium enterprises. I don't think you'll see a huge pickup, but I think you'll see a modest pickup. \n At the same time, just because people are increasingly back in offices and kids are definitely, mostly, if not entirely, back in school, I think you'll see a little bit of a tick-down in leisure business. Now the weekends will continue to rage, I think. The weekends have been extraordinary, but the midweek leisure travel will continue to tick down. And I think those 2 will largely offset each other in the fourth quarter. \n I think group will remain pretty consistent. Obviously, we had a big uptick in the summer, and then Delta variant sort of slid out the momentum a little bit on group. People think -- there's advanced planning. People have to spend money. And so while there's plenty of group occurring, it's really largely sports and social. At this point, I think that continues about -- like what we've seen in the third quarter into the fourth because people are -- all the pent-up demand is there, but people are sort of advanced planning more into next year, just to sort of finally get through Delta and hopefully to the endemic stage of COVID, which sort of feels like is we're in the process of doing as we speak. \n As we think about 2022 with all those segments, what I would say is I think leisure will remain elevated relative to historical standards. Obviously, my belief is kids will still be back in school. More offices are going to open. So midweek, we'll get back to more normalized levels. But I think the weekends, people want to be out. Turns out they didn't like being locked in their closets and basements and attics, and so they're going to want to get out. And we've seen this pattern of very high demand on weekends. I think that will continue. And so I think on the margin, leisure will be -- continue to be stronger than we've historically seen sort of in pre-COVID times. \n I think business transient will continue to move up. You'll continue to see great strength in small and medium enterprises, which aren't fully back to pre-COVID but getting pretty close. And my own belief is you'll start to see the large corporates step into the game. I mean they're already in the game, but they're still sort of like 40% off of '19 levels. I think you'll see a step change in the large corporates which will contribute, along with SMEs, to continued upticks in business transient.\n And then I think group is clearly going to be better next year than this year. I think reality is the first quarter probably is typically a slow group quarter. I don't think it will be different in that way. I think people are going to want to sort of clear the mechanism of getting past the winter, just because concerns of flu seasons and all that, given what we've all been through. But I think as you get into Qs 2, 3 and 4, both booked business and realized business on the group side are going to be better. \n So I think 2022 is sizing up to be -- I think the fourth quarter is sizing up to be fairly similar to the third quarter, and I think 2022 is sizing up to be another big step forward on recovery to more normalized times. Yes. Another we've spent a lot of time looking at that through the last couple of quarters and very recently. Here's what I'd say. I gave you a sense, so I won't repeat what both Kevin and I said about NUG. Kevin, we both talked about it this year. I gave you a sense in our prepared comments that we think we'll be in the mid-single-digits for the next couple of years. Obviously, that requires a lot of work. It requires signing deals, starting construction that then ultimately it lands in our NUG numbers.\n I think when you look back 2 years from now at this period of time, I am of the mind and reasonably confident that what you will see is the trough in deal signings was last year. As Kevin mentioned, we're going to be up in the mid- to high single-digits in signings this year, we think. I mean we're not done with the year. We always have a good flurry of activity at the end, but we got a lot of it on the books, and so we're pretty damn confident we're going to be up nicely. And I don't see why next year, given what's going on in the environment in terms of -- particularly operating recovery, pricing power, which I'm sure we'll come to, I'll do it maybe in another question, that we're going to see more deals signed next year. \n So I think last year was probably, in my mind, the trough for signings. I think this year, for those same exact reasons, will be the trough in construction starts. Starts always will lag the signings a little bit. We're definitely going to be a little bit modestly down in signings this year after being down last year. Our expectation is that will turn around next year, and that's why we think we'll be sort of in the mid-single-digits for a couple of years and then back on track being in the 6% to 7% range, just because, starting this year, we're signing more. Starting next year, we're starting more. We're obviously filling in a lot. You saw in the second quarter, 1/3 of our NUG was conversion, so we're filling in. And so between all of those factors, we think, ultimately, when we get out past a couple of years, we're back. The goal is to be back in the 6% to 7%. And I think given what I see in the environment that we feel pretty good about that. \n I mean -- and I'll probably stop there with the only comment being things are going to come back faster than prior recoveries here, and that's because the thing that's very different than every other cycle I've seen in my 40 years, and I'll leave it at this, and somebody, I'm sure, will have a question, is just pricing power. I mean the reality is, typically, it's like a grind to build back occupancy, and rate lags significantly. Rate is leading the charge, and that, obviously, flows really nicely. We've done a bunch of things, as you know, and we've talked about a lot to create higher-margin businesses out of all of these brands. And when you flush all that through, even with labor costs up and all of those fun things, these are higher-margin businesses. And part of this is just we're in an inflationary environment. And guess what? We can reprice our product every second of every day. We're a very good hedge in that way to inflation, and we're being very thoughtful about how we're pricing our product. \n And so I think when we all look back on it, this will be a faster recovery on the development side than we've seen in prior cycles. And -- so I think we're going to be back in -- on a very nice trajectory next year. Yes. A great question. Yes, I did sort of serve that up. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised I'm getting asked. Listen, you embedded in the question is part of the answer. But obviously, we feel -- first of all, let me not be pedantic but say what I say a lot when I'm asked this question. The laws of economics are alive and well, right? And that's what's going on. Why is leisure so strong in rate? Why are we able to price above historically high levels? Because there are crazy amounts of demand. Like our weekend demand is off the chart. We're running 85% to 90% system-wide in the U.S. on the weekends, and we're pricing over '19 levels, obviously, because we have a lot of demand. \n I do think that will -- that leisure pricing power will continue because, what I said before, I believe that leisure demand is going to remain at elevated levels, particularly on the weekends, and that that's going to give us nice pricing power. Even though, obviously, the recovery in business transient has lagged, as I said in the quarter, we were 75%, but it's sort of a tale of 2 cities, which is I implied it a little bit. You have -- the big corporates which are still 40% off, but then you have small and medium which are only maybe 10%. You could even argue maybe 5% or 10% off. And so we have a fair amount of pricing power in the biggest piece -- in the biggest segments, and they are less price sensitive. \n So broadly, your biggest -- it's not everybody. Your biggest corporate customers can end up with sort of off bar, 10% or 20%. Small and medium might end up at 5% or 7%. So that's why we were working so hard on accessing more of that demand base pre-COVID and has helped us during COVID. \n And so when you put it all together and you look at like even in the quarter, we're at 90% of -- in business transient combined, we're already at 90% of 2019 levels, even though we still have a ways to go to build back demand. So I feel -- it's a long ways to go. I feel pretty good about where that's going because we're going to keep pushing on small and medium. That's almost back. My guess is that will exceed prior levels. And then the corporates are going to come in. And that's going to allow us to put more on the top of the funnel to price -- have more demand, allows us to price more aggressively. \n I think when it's all said and done, if we were 80-20 before, and I don't know exactly where it will be, but my suspect we will probably never go back to 80-20 in reality because we have been successful at finding other segments that we think are going to be there. They're going to be more resilient, and they're going to be higher priced. So my guess is we will be managing to probably a 90-10 world or something like that. But we do think pricing power is not in business transient what it is in leisure, but it's not far off. \n And then group, group is sort of in the year, for the year similar to business transient. But as you look forward, because there's so much pent-up demand, and as I've talked about at least on the last call, we're actually pricing already over '19 levels. So there's pricing power. And you'd say, well, \"Wow, if group is still way off from a consumer revenue point of view, what's going on?\" Well, what's going on is group is very -- the one segment that books weigh in advance, and there's a limited amount of meeting space in the world and in the United States. We happen to have a lot of it. I mean there are a few of us that are very big players in that space. A lot of people want it. And so the reality is, again, laws of economics are alive and well. People want it. There's not enough of it. You have huge pent-up demand that's sort of getting all -- events that didn't happen, that need to happen, new events. And that's pushing into next year. \n And so even though, in the moment, group revenues aren't what they were, on a forward-looking basis, there is a good amount of pricing power, which is why on a -- all of our advanced bookings in the next year are pricing over '19 levels at this point. \n So again, back to the bait I put out there, I guess, it's unusual. Like I hate to admit how long I've been doing this but a long time. I guess I said it before. But it just hasn't really happened this way. Now there are a lot of reasons. We're better, right? We got much more sophisticated revenue management systems. We're much more on top of it, I think, than we've ever been. Obviously, we're in a more inflationary environment broadly. Thank you, Federal Reserve and the U.S. Congress, for fiscal and monetary stimulus. We could debate transitory or otherwise, but those things are translating into, broadly, a more highly inflationary environment. And that applies to us, too, and that obviously is helping from a pricing power point of view. Yes. It's very straightforward. We've done 2. The one you mentioned with Plateno was the Hampton Inn. And then more recently, I mentioned in my comments, we just actually opened our first Home2 Suites by Hilton in China on the road to doing 1,000 of them with Country Garden, one of the largest players in China, which is another master license agreement. So we've done those 2. \n Never say never. I'm not saying -- but the idea was to really help -- get help from very large local players that knew how to garner scale very quickly to help build our network effect in China and then ultimately come back in with our other brands and do it ourselves. And so that's exactly what we're doing with Hilton Garden Inn. We obviously have a massive franchise system here in the United States and frankly in Europe now, where the bulk of the business here is franchised. Increasingly, I think we're now -- the majority of the business in Europe is franchised. It's been a much smaller part of the business in China and in Asia Pacific, so we historically haven't had the same level of resources. \n And so what we've done during COVID is made some strategic investments to build out more infrastructure so that we can take other brands in our -- of our 18 brand -- a family of brands and do it ourselves. \n And so we're trying to be very sort of balanced and balance all the risks associated with our expansion around the world, and we think it's great to work with third parties. We love the Country Garden folks and Plateno. They've been incredibly important partners, will continue to be for a long, long time. But it's also important that we have that skill set ourselves in franchising. Is it -- while it's similar in China, it's not exactly the same. And so we've learned a lot and I think built a -- we're building a good infrastructure and a good muscle set to be able to take a bunch of other brands and do just what we've done here in the U.S., Europe and other places. I didn't hear the question. TAM. Okay, you're going tech on me. I love that. I love that. We do look at TAM. I mean I'm not going to give you there. It's thousands, right? Think of it in the following way. We have limited service hotels in the U.S., probably 4,500. We have a population of 320 million people. You have 1.3 billion people there, so there's no limit in my lifetime at least, probably not, you're younger than me, but I'm not that old, so probably not in your lifetime either. Thousands and thousands. You could easily have 10,000 or 20,000 or more, so I think there's growth opportunities in the mid-market as far as the eye can see in China. \n So while we have done some TAM work in China every time we come back and look at the numbers, they're just -- they're off the charts. There are no rational limitations given what our footprint is, what the population is and the growth in their middle class. Yes. Smedes, I had a hard time hearing some of that, but I think I captured it, the labor costs and what owners are telling us. It's obviously been a big issue and one that we spent a lot of time on, a complex issue in terms of what's sort of underneath the problem. \n What I would say is, obviously, there is no one owner group. The different owners in different parts of the country and the world, for that matter, have different views. But if I sort of homogenize it all, which is hard to do, but if I do it in my head, I would say while it's still a very difficult issue, we've started to see easing in terms of access to labor. I think we have ways to go. There are a bunch of things we're doing to help from a technology point of view to access pools of labor that maybe we hadn't accessed historically. But broadly, more labor is coming back in, and some of those pressures are easing. Obviously, labor is more expensive pretty much everywhere. I think that's a reality. Where it settles out, I think it's a little early to know, but I think it is sort of settling down as people are gradually coming back into the workforce. \n I think the end of the question, which is a really important one, which I sort of touched on earlier in one of my other filibusters, was how is it going to look for owners on the other side? And again, it's hard -- some owners -- depends on location, product, 1,000 factors. But broadly -- and we're already seeing it. I think I said this. Broadly, I think when we get to the other side of this, across the system, margins are going to be higher, and you know why. With input costs going up, labor costs going up and all of those fun things, they're going to be -- margins are going to be higher because rate is going to be a lot higher ultimately when we get past this for all the reasons I talked about in terms of the pricing power that we have and the broader inflationary environment. That's very helpful to the business. \n At the same time, particularly in the mega categories, which is where the bulk of the hotels are with our ownership community, we did a bunch of really important work and did a lot of testing and learning and made a bunch of changes in the hotels. In the end, we think, to create a better experience for our customers, but to do it in a more efficient way to drive higher margins. So we're pretty confident. And we have pretty good evidence, which I'll talk about that, even with the -- when labor comes back and you have to pay labor more, given where rate structures are going to be in most places and given the efficiencies that we've been able to garner, that these are -- our owners are going to end up with higher-margin businesses. \n And by the way, many, many of them, not all of them. So for those that haven't gotten there that are listening, keep the faith. But many, many owners are already there. Some of it is unsustainable, meaning part of it is they can't get enough labor, and so they don't have enough people, so their labor costs are unusually low. But even in places where they are able to get the labor back for the reasons I described, meaning more efficiencies on our standards and pricing power on the top line, they're driving very good margins. \n And so we've had -- the owners are -- have been in pain. I don't want to minimize it. There's still many of them in a lot of pain, but we're doing our level best to get them to the other side and make sure their businesses are stronger, both because that's what we should do, as a fiduciary to them, but also, ultimately, if we want to continue to be able to grow, we have to give them an investment alternative that continues to makes sense from a return point of view. And so we're hyper focused on it. \n And I would say, I feel really good. As I said, I think the development cycle will flip faster than we've seen in prior cycles for these reasons. I just think that the economics -- the laws of economics are alive and well. I've said it now twice or three times, that if people can get great returns because of the conditions, macro and micro, macro world going on micro the things we're doing, then they're going to want to build us more hotels. And obviously, with the signings being up in the mid -- double -- mid-teens to plus, we think that's pretty good prima facie evidence that that's what's going on. Yes. I mean it would be weighted to Qs 2 through 4, first of all, for the reasons I covered in a prior answer. Just meaning people want to get through the winter, one. Two, the first quarter is never a big group quarter. So you put those 2 things together, and it trends heavily to Qs 2, 3 and 4. \n We're in the 75%, 80% on the books, which is about consistent with where we were in the last quarter. And what happened is, I think if you hadn't had the Delta variant spike, we'd probably be somewhat further along. But you had the Delta variant sort of slow -- they cooled off the advanced bookings on the group side, which have now picked back up. \n The other thing going on, of course, is we want to -- we do believe there's going to be a lot of group potential, particularly in Qs 2, 3 and 4. And we don't want to commit. There's a level of -- lack of desire on our part to commit too much space when we know that there'll be a lot of pricing power, so it's sort of a bit of a delicate balancing act. I don't think so. You heard my views, so you can -- we can have a debate about it, but I don't think so for the following reason. I think the midweek is already being bled out now, so I don't -- I think most people -- most kids are back in school. It's in truncate's mobility even if people are in the office, so while more offices are going to open through the rest of this year and into next year. What we've seen in the pattern of leisure during the midweek, it's our -- we've sort of washed out a large part of that already. I may be wrong, but I believe the weekends are going to remain strong, simply because I still think, if you look at the $3 trillion of incremental savings during COVID, there's a long way to go to spend it all. And I think people still want to do -- they want the experiences that they were starved for, and now it gets concentrated more on weekends, which is what we're seeing now. I believe that will continue. \n I don't -- so the net of it is, my view, just to be clear, is that relative to a normalized like '19 level of leisure demand, I think we're getting back more towards that with a little bit better because I think the weekends are going to be a little bit better. I'm not -- I agree with you. I don't think that the midweek leisure is going to be raging, and that's not sort of built into my expectations.\n In terms of outbound, yes, the world is opening up. But then there's inbound, too. Particularly for the cities that -- the big cities, top 25 markets that historically depend on 20% of their business from inbound international travel, they've had 0. And starting next week or week after, the floodgates are going to open on that. So yes, you're going to have some people going outbound, but you're going to have a lot of people that want to come see America that is going to offset that and particularly with the top 25 markets, broadly, but particularly in the top 25 markets that are going to come in. \n Again, we're still in the middle of budgets, and we're still debating all of this and where it ends up. There's -- I'm giving you my opinion and my sense of it. I think leisure will remain -- when we wake up next year and the following year, and you compare it to the amount of leisure business that we did, which was probably 25% or 30% of our overall segmentation pre-COVID, I think it will be higher than that. And I think it will be higher than that because people want to get out more. There's plenty of incremental savings in the world that has not gotten anywhere close to being spent. And the weekend business, while we were doing better on weekends than we had historically, I think it will stay even more elevated than that. Yes. We don't have anything new. But to repeat what I said last time, we are very interested in getting back to returning capital. We firmly believe in our capital allocation strategy pre-COVID, which was we were producing a lot of free cash flow that we didn't -- we can continue to grow the business in an industry-leading way without the use of much of it. And we wanted, as a result, to give it back to our shareholders because there was no reason for us to hoard it or do dumb things with it. And disciplined capital allocation, we believe, is a hallmark of long term, delivering great returns for shareholders. \n Our -- my belief hasn't been changed through COVID. The only thing that changed is we didn't have a lot of free cash flow during the heat of the crisis. We are obviously getting past that. We are cash flow positive. We want to just give it a little bit more time, as I said on the last call, sort of finish out the year. And if things go as we expect and consistent with what we have been seeing, we're going to reinstate a return of capital program in the first half of next year. And my guess is it will look quite similar. I mean, we're still having that discussion with our Board who obviously has a say in it. But I think if I had to pick a line, I think it will look a lot like what we were doing pre-COVID. And we're very focused on it and very anxious to get back to it. And so I direct you, I would say first half of next year. Yes, really good question. I don't feel really a lot different than I did pre-COVID. I mean we believe there's an efficient frontier, and we've calculated it as best we can by individual market property, what -- based on what they can deliver at that price point versus what we can deliver, how do we deliver the highest index -- the highest revenue for the lowest distribution cost. And we do believe, and that's why we've had a good relationship with the OTAs, that they play a part in that. It's traditionally been in the sort of 10% or 12% range, and that's historically where we've been. During COVID, that went up. \n But if -- we wanted it to go up. We partnered, I think, quite successfully with our OTA partners, knowing that the biggest segment of demand that was out there for most of COVID was lower-rated leisure, which is what they are particularly good at, non-loyalty -- nonloyal-type customer base. And so it has crept -- it crept up a bit but not too terribly much, and we've already seen that sort of peak and start to come down. \n And so while we'll look at the efficient frontier as we always do periodically and maybe if you think leisure is going to be a little bit higher component overall, maybe it goes up a little, but not much, and it didn't move that much. So the net of all that is I think when we wake up in a couple of years, it will look an awful lot like it did before. And we obviously feel good about the contractual terms that we have with the OTAs now and our ability to continue to have attractive terms going forward. \n As it relates to Honors, the -- my Honors team is probably listening, and they may need a diaper for this. But we're -- we maxed out in the 63%, 64% system-wide. And we're already in the U.S., as I mentioned in my prepared comments, not that far off of that. Globally, we're coming back as our more of -- number one, we've accessed more travelers that weren't loyal. So some of these leisure travelers that we didn't have access to, we've now accessed. And more of our core customer is getting back on the road. We're getting back to normal. \n But I'm not going to put a number out there because I'll give a heart -- my team will have a heart attack. But I believe that there is a lot of room to grow. I think the super majority -- if we're doing our job, the super majority of our customers want to be Honors members. It's a proposition that they get benefits that you just don't get, and they're meaningful. And you can go through them. They get discounts. They get technology. They get experiences money can't buy. They get points that are currency. They can shop on Amazon and Lyft and buy tickets at Live Nation. And there is no reason, as we continue coming out of this, to actively engage with our customer base, where it shouldn't be -- we shouldn't be able to push it meaningfully higher than where we kept -- where we maxed out before. \n Now that will take time. And so to my Honors team, don't freak out. We're going to give you the time. But our goals there, which I'm not going to state publicly, are meaningfully higher than where we were, which, by the way, is meaningfully higher than any of our competitors already. Thanks, everybody, for the time today. I know it's a busy earnings season. We're obviously quite pleased given what we've all lived through over the last 20 months to be able to report the progress that we were able to report for the third quarter. As you could tell from the call, I remain quite optimistic about where this recovery is going and what the opportunities are in the industry but particularly for our business and the growth of our business. And we'll look forward to reporting fourth quarter and full year after the New Year. Look forward to seeing many of you while we're out on the road. And have a terrific day and holiday, if I don't see you."

After today's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.\nJill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update, or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financials on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call, in our earnings press release, and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President of Global Development will then review our second quarter results. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think our second quarter results demonstrate, we continue to make significant progress towards recovery, working hard to serve all of our stakeholders. For our guests to deliver reliable and friendly experiences in a very demanding environment, for our team members to maintain an award-winning culture by creating an inclusive safe and welcoming environment full of opportunities, for our owners to drive value through premium market share and efficient and effective operating models, for our communities to remain a positive force for good at a time when it is needed most, and finally, for our shareholders to maximize profits free cash flow and overall total returns. We're pleased to see that our diligence and determination are beginning to pay off. As much of the world reopens, the pent-up demand for travel we've been anticipating is happening. While the pace of recovery varies and COVID variants remain a risk, we are seeing significant sequential improvement in every major region. In the second quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down 36%, improving 17 percentage points versus the first quarter with June RevPAR improving 24 percentage points versus the first quarter, and down only 29 points versus 2019.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis, as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restrictions and surging leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 36.1% compared to 2019. Performance was largely balanced between occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million in the second quarter and those results reflect relaxed travel restrictions and strengthening global demand. Management and franchise fees grew 220%, demonstrating the resiliency of our fee-based business model. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session.  And the first question will come from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Thanks. You gave some great color on NUG, but I'd like to peel back the onion a bit more. Specifically, can you discuss how net unit growth expectations have evolved over the quarter as we look around the world? Where your increased confidence comes from across things like brands, ads, leases, conversions? And how the financing environment is changing, as we consider not only this year but sustained growth beyond? Thanks.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. Stephen, thank you. Good question and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world, on the development side, I think, so goes the recovery, sort of, so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. So versus our earlier expectations and why we're a bit more optimistic, obviously, and have raised our outlook for the year is, largely driven by what we were seeing in faster recovery in the U.S. and faster recovery in Asia, really China. And I'd say those are sort of the largest drivers. If you think about recovery, that's where -- as we suggested in the prepared comments, that's where we see the steepest slope of recovery. Europe is, obviously -- we knew would be lagging and isn't contributing as much as the U.S. and China is at this point. But, obviously, our expectation there is, as the U.K. and Europe continue to open, we'll see a meaningful uptick there. So, I think it's pretty much that simple slope of recovery steeper, more activity on the development side in terms of both signings and openings people are back at it and picking up steam. On the conversions, I'd say just modestly better. As you would note from prior calls, we've been -- we've had high expectations for conversions. We have some great conversion brands. The system is performing at the highest levels from a market share point of view than it's ever performed in our history and I think that's a great leading indicator for opportunities to convince folks who are independent to come into the fold as well as folks that have weaker brands that are looking for a better performance to come into the fold, both of which are happening at a little bit better than our expectations. And so, while we had -- we expected things to pick up in the conversion area. I would say this year and then leading into next because a lot of -- some of the signings will take some time. Most of them have pretty quickly, but some of them will take some time in terms of CapEx work, property improvement programs and the like. It's modestly better than what were pretty high expectations. In terms of the financing environment, I mean there's a lot to discuss. I think -- so we can get to lots of other questions. I think the simple answer is, it's improving. I mean the world is a big place. So again, following the slope of recovery, the US and China, I would say the financing markets are recovering most rapidly, because markets are efficient. And performance is starting to really pick up and not just from an occupancy, but you're getting back to rate levels very rapidly, probably more rapidly than I've ever seen in my 40 years of doing this. What happens is the lender community starts to have more confidence. Rates are obviously hyper low and have been low, and lenders need yield. And so, the more comfort they get that recovery is afoot, and that there's going to be a recovery back to where we were and then beyond, the more they're willing to take the risk go a little bit further out on the risk spectrum and underwrite it. And so, you're seeing pretty robust financing markets in China. The US is still -- has a ways to go. I mean you can look at the data out there it's not anywhere near where it was, but it's improving. And my expectation is as you get into the fall, and I'm sure we'll talk about this I'll leave it for other questions. And our belief my belief is that we're going to continue to have very, very strong recovery in the fall, and into next year you're going to continue to see a gradual increase in financing that's available certainly here in the US. I think Europe will take a little longer. So, a ways to go. I'm not saying, it's back anywhere near where it was. It's a long way off. But of sort of off the floors of what we had seen last year.\nStephen Grambling: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, could you talk a little bit about how you guys plan to use key money in development spend? And obviously, in light of the financing environment that you just talked about and the way that's coming around, is it something you guys maybe rely on a little bit more in the near term and then start to wean away from it as we get more comfortable with kind of the outlook for new unit growth and things of that nature.\nChris Nassetta: Yes, that's a good question. If you look at the numbers, we had a little bit higher key money in the quarter than we would typically have. What I would say is, I don't see anything that -- I don't think anything is changing materially meaning still over 90% of the deals that we are doing are dry deals. We're not spending -- we're not using the balance sheet anyway. So, there's not any material shift given what's going on in the broader macro environment, the financing markets. Nothing material that shifted. The reason you're seeing a little bit heavier key money spend right now, is a super positive story in the sense that both things that we've been working on for a long time and/or opportunities that have arisen because of the pandemic have sort of come together in an unusual way this year. So, example some of the bigger key money expenditures are iconic assets for our portfolio, largely resort-oriented that we've been working on that will be generational. They'll be in the system for decades and decades and decades. So, the Waldorf Astoria in Monarch Beach and Laguna, I've literally been working on that deal one way or another for 20 years I think, between host and here. And that's in the system an incredible addition to the Waldorf brand. Resorts World, which I talked about in my prepared comments, 3,500 rooms on The Strip, we're basically the only major player on The Strip with a massive meetings platform and 3,500 rooms. We've been working on that for a number of years. Not a crazy amount of key money, by any means, but relative to our normal expenditures is significant. And then the deals that I talked about in Mexico, the three deals 1,500 rooms in Puerto Vallarta and then in Tulum, these are incredible assets that were either existing in the one case and PV was an existing hotel that was operating with another brand. And in the case of Tulum was developed literally over 20 years to get the entitlements with another brand. And because of COVID and what has happened in the industry presented an opportunity for us. And so that allowed us to enter the zone on hotels that would have taken us a decade to sort of pull together and in a matter of six or 12 months we're going to have these purpose-built incredible hotels in the system. And so that's I know a long answer but I view all of those and then there's some others that I'm not going to be mentioning. But those are the big ones that's like incredible progress for us in all-inclusive in resorts and in luxury. And those deals just don't come around that often. We're getting a few more of them now as I said aided by COVID. So, maybe there -- I would say our spending overall is going to be up probably this year and next year relative to 2020 but 2020 was a depressed year. If you look at it versus our normal run rate like 2017, 2018, and 2019, honestly, I think our overall CapEx is sort of going to be within the ranges that we would have been. But again, I don't see anything -- we don't see anything material. We still think over 90% of our deals are going to be dry. And when we have these really unique opportunities even with key money they're very nice returns for us and they're incredibly I think strategic and important to the system.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thanks Chris. That\u2019s super helpful. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good morning Chris, good morning Kevin. Good morning Jill.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning Joe.\nKevin Jacobs: Good morning Joe.\nJoe Greff: Given significant progress we've seen in the operating environment given your balance sheet and where your leverage ratios are heading by the end of this year I was hoping you could give us an update on how you're thinking about what you're looking at which might be obvious but and how you're looking at the timing of resuming capital return.\nChris Nassetta: Great. Great question. I figured I'd get it and I figured I'd get it early. So, thank you. I know that's on everybody's mind. And we have obviously talked a bunch about it. We ultimately that's a decision we'll go to our board with. We have an upcoming meeting. We've had broader dialogue but we haven't pinned it down. But I said on the last call that I was pretty confident that we would be reinstituting return of capital program next year. I still feel that way. Obviously, the slope of the recovery is even steeper. So, I would say the update to that would be I feel confident that we're going to do in the first half of next year. The exact date and time to be determined when we talk to our Board. But I think you should read the results of second quarter you should read the commentary that Kevin and I gave in our prepared comments plus everything you're hopefully going to get in color to say that we're very optimistic. We know we're not we read the papers I talk to a lot of people. We're not oblivious to the delta variant and things that are going on in the world but we're confident because we think we will power through that. The trends that we see real time are very strong and improving. We feel really good about that going to happen in the fall. And so yes we -- every quarter that goes by I think we feel better and better about where the recovery is going. And so that should ultimately translate into our feeling better about starting to return capital because we'll be generating real significant free cash flow. In my mind, next year and we do not need to hoard it our belief has always been that as I said in my prior answer we're going to be able to keep growing with very little use of our own balance sheet. And so we're going to give it back to folks. So, my expectation is in the first half of next year that program will resume and we'll be having some discussion with our Board in the very near future.\nJoe Greff: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning everyone.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning Shaun.\nShaun Kelley: Good morning Chris. You mentioned a couple of times now just talking about that recovery in the fall. So, I was hoping we could dig in there a little bit. I know you're sort of probably right at the cusp of when you have too much color you can actually share on the corporate side. But can you talk about how that is starting to firm up be it September-October and what data you have? And then last quarter you talked a little bit about an exit trajectory for the year of possibly something in the down 30% range and I appreciate it may be a little early to give an update to that but kind of how are you thinking about that relative to maybe where we were three months ago?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, totally fair question. That's the $64,000 question I think everybody is trying to figure out. So, I'll give you I mean we do have some data points and some and I'll give you my opinion on top of it. I mean we've obviously seen, as Kevin and I both described in the nuggets that we gave in our comments that you wouldn't find in the press release, we've seen really nice recovery and that recovery has been across the board. Obviously, the greatest strength in leisure but significant pickup in business travel and significant pickup while -- further to go in the group side. And we continue to see that, notwithstanding the delta variant and all the things going on. Like I got just last night as an example, system-wide US occupancy was 74%, Trailing seven days 74%. That's with the urban markets with some urban hotels not even open and those are in the comp set. And with all of our -- so all of the urban hotels, obviously the urban environment has been lagging a little bit. So what that says to you like last night, if we're running 74%, that's not leisure. I mean, while we have a leisure-oriented hotels, we have a lot of business-oriented hotels. And so mid-week occupancies at that level are definitely reflective of business travel being back. And we've seen it, literally it's funny sort of post Memorial Day, I mean you just saw the shift. You just saw a shift where weekday occupancies went up 10% or 20% at any given night went up 10 or 20 percentage points. And that was business travel dominated by small and medium-sized businesses by the way. But even pre-COVID keep in mind 80% of our business travel was small and medium-sized business, right? So that's sort of currently what's going on. I know your question is forward looking and I promise you I'm going to get to that. I think the trajectory my own view and I think the data sort of supports this, as you get into August what's going to happen is you're going to continue to have massive surge in leisure travel because everybody wants to get out, notwithstanding again the delta variants and the like. We've not seen impact in sort of consumer behavior from that. So I think you're going to have continued very good strength in the leisure. I do think in August you'll -- as you always do, you will see business transient fall off a little bit, right just because people are going to be like they always do, they're going to be not traveling for business as much and going on more vacations. And it's sort of the last hurrah before maybe a lot of people going back to work. And the kids are finally going back to school and all that fun stuff. But when you get to the fall and limited -- we have limited data obviously this far out. So this is -- I gave you data points that I have real time today. When you get 60, 90 days out, business transient stats a lot of the bookings haven't occurred. So this is where it gets into my view of what I think will happen. I think you get after Labor Day, I do believe -- I'm not a health expert, but I'm talking to a lot of them. I do believe we will have powered through the Delta thing, if you look at the stats on hospitalization and the like, they're really not terrible. If you look at what's happened in the UK and we're sort of three or four weeks behind them, the patterns there right now are quite good. They have infection rates down 50% on a trailing 12 day basis over there. So I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic that we sort of power through that. And when we get to the fall, here's what I think we do know, kids are going back to school. I mean, we'll debate whether they're wearing masks or not. Some places, yes but they're going back to school and I'm pretty confident in that. And offices are opening. I mean they may open different times. Some people you're reading you're going to push it a month or whatever. Obviously, I said we're open. We're open and operating here at our -- at all of our headquarters. But you're going to have people back at work which means with kids in school, with baby sitters and with people in the office, you're going to have more propensity to want to travel. And when we talk to customers, again, I can't give you the booking data because it's too far out. When we talk to customers anecdotally, it supports all of that that when you get into the fall, people are going to be traveling. There's both pent-up demand okay, if things they've been needing to do and then there's just demand, generally to -- for folks to be able to run their businesses. And so I think as you get into the fall, you're going to see the natural reduction in the leisure as we always do because now kids are in school. They weren't last year. Kids are in school, people are back in the office, they don't have as much time to go on vacation. I do believe again, I can't prove it, but my belief is leisure will be elevated for a while because we're still living in a bit of a hybrid world. But I think business transient will come back. Group will obviously take a little longer gestation period, but group will definitely be coming back the booking trends into the third, particularly the fourth quarter are much better than they've been. And I think we're motoring forward. In terms of -- last time, I believe I said that I think we'd be back to sort of 70% by the end of the year of 2019 levels. And obviously, I feel better. So while we're not giving guidance, so I'm not going to do it. We're not ready to start doing that. There's still enough uncertainty we want to wait. We do do forecast, okay? I mean we're not -- it's not Camp Runamuck here. We are looking at our numbers. And I'd say our view is demand levels probably -- RevPAR levels are probably in the US and globally somewhere circa 80% versus the 70% I thought. In our current thinking demand levels probably back to 85%. So we're getting there. And we're -- I mean again, much -- I said last time recovery has been much steeper than we thought. I say it again today. Just things have been coming back more quickly than we would have thought. We knew they'd come back. Obviously, you all know I've been optimistic about the recovery but it's even better than I would have thought. I think one of the most surprising things, although it shouldn't be to any of us because as I kid our team the laws of economics are alive and well. And the most surprising thing is how quickly rate comes back. But that's \u2013 again that's just demand, right? We're pricing demand, we're being really smart about it. But I do believe when this \u2013 when we look back on this recovery the most unusual thing relative to any other period of my almost 40 years of doing this will be just a rapid return of rate.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you for all the detail.\nChris Nassetta: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on that. I wanted to follow up a little bit on that. I think in your opening remarks you said that your group bookings are trending greater now in 2022 than they were in 2019, which I think is a pretty big positive increase sequentially from what you've mentioned on your first quarter call. And I was just hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the composition of those groups and what you're seeing on the rate side. And maybe just kind of a little more color around folks' willingness to book group at this point.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. Still \u2013 great question still building. What I said is that all of our bookings for 2022 are at rates that are greater than 2019. So to be specific rate. I didn't say volume. Volume is still a bit off just because it takes time to build the book. So my expectation is we get closer to next year and in the next year. In the year for the \u2013 later in this year, particularly when you get past this Delta, the Delta wave and then in the year for the year we'll be a barn burner year bigger than anything we've ever seen in the year for the year simply because people have to meet. It takes time to plan it. They want to sort of get through their budget season before they know how much money they have. But I'm not worried about the volumes next year. Again they're a bit \u2013 they're not where we were at 2019. They're close but they're not there but the rate is above. And so what I've been \u2013 honestly, what I've been saying to our teams is be really careful like we \u2013 there's going to be a monumental amount of demand we don't want to give it away. We want to make sure that we're pricing. Even though we're not at the volumes now, my expectation very strongly is it's all going to fill in. It just takes it a little bit longer given what's the reason for this recession being a health issue. And sort of getting through the final stages of that in my opinion is required before you really get the momentum on the volume. And so that's why rates are up is because we're being super disciplined recognizing that there's a limited amount of meeting space, there's going to be a gargantuan amount of demand and we can be a bit patient I think given what's going on.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nThomas Allen: Thanks. So on net unit growth, you've obviously seen some great progression in terms of your guide and you gave some helpful color earlier. But do you think you can get back to the 6% to 7% unit growth you were putting up pre-COVID? And if so when? \nChris Nassetta: Yes I do. And I think it's probably sometime between 2023 and 2024 Kevin?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes.\nChris Nassetta: Kevin is also Head of Development. So I want to make sure he's \u2013 before I commit to him. Yes, I think it's sometime in 2023, 2024. Probably more 2024 just because you got to get through the \u2013 if you look at starts last year, you'd look at \u2013 I mean if you look at the progression you'll see when we're done last year we were down in starts. This year we'll be down modestly, not nearly as much as last year in starts. And I think that's the bottom. And then I think next year we'll be ramping up in starts. And I think if you just play that through that's what gets us in the mid-single digits for the next sort of couple of years two or three and then I think you're back in business in the 6% to 7% range.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. if the average construction time or gestation period in the pipeline is 2.5 or three years, you've got to be 2.5 or three years past the bottom, before you get back to your old run rate. \nThomas Allen: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Yes, I wanted to ask you about the pipeline as well. You mentioned that conversions were I think you said 30% of signings. I'm wondering what percent of openings that was in Q2 and maybe what you expect it to be for the full year? And then just on the theme of pipeline, you mentioned mid-single digits for the next two or three years. I think last quarter you had said that 2022 might be kind of in the 4% to 5% range but maybe lower than this year just given that there was some kind of construction catch up this year. So I'm wondering with the higher unit growth rate here in 2021. Does that carry through to sort of continued acceleration into 2022, or in fact is it bringing forward some things you thought would open in 2022 that kind of bring forward into 2021 and so maybe we'd still see that slightly lower rate closer to 4% next year than the 5% for 2022? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Robin, thanks. All good questions I think I've got it. I'll try to go in order. I think on the conversion front openings were lower. I don't remember the exact percentage but they were circa 10% of openings for the quarter. And that was just timing. I'd say last year we were sort of 19% 20% of openings. I think this year it will be that or maybe even a little bit higher given sort of the number of signings we had in the second quarter. And so that's -- I think that's a good way to think about it. And look we are doing more conversions. Very happy with the conversions in the second quarter, really nice mix between hard brands, soft brands, conversions from independents, conversions from other brands regionally. So very happy with that. But that said, our pace of deliveries of new builds is going up as well. So it's sort of hard -- it's a little bit harder for that percentage to move. And of course, that's all baked into our outlook. The idea of -- I'll do the third one next the idea of 2022 being affected not as much. I mean I think 2022 is going to be about what we expect maybe a little bit of timing pull forward replaced by a little bit more conversions. So 2022 is about the same as we thought.  And then yes, you picked up on we said 4% to 5% for the next several years we were not pointing to any one specific year when we said 4% to 5%. And now we're saying mid-single digits which of course 4% to 5% is mid-single digits. So it's about the same but I think what you're hearing is a little bit more optimism about the future of net unit growth given what's been going on lately.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you very much.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: Next question is from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nRichard Clarke : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask your sort of opinion your thoughts on labor shortages in the US. And there's been some commentary around drops in service levels. Obviously, it's across the whole industry. But how much truth is there in that, or is this working the other way you actually being able to realize some sort of bigger efficiencies by working with less on the hotel side level? \nChris Nassetta: Yes thanks Rick. It's a great question. Labor shortage is a real issue, probably the single biggest issue that we're dealing with that is definitely not just for Hilton but industry -- all service industries and manufacturing and a lot of your supply chain issues that you're reading about every day. All of this is sort of interconnected to not having enough labor. At a high level, I think it will largely resolve itself over the next couple of quarters in the sense that I think there are a lot of complex reasons behind it. Some of it is obviously health. People still don't feel like particularly with the Delta variant now that they should go back to work, some people because they're worried about their health as already `been -- we haven't had kids in schools, so we don't effectively have day care. There are women in the workforce or where it's been most dramatically impacted because they have to stay home to take care of kids. And then some of the government programs that were really important last year in the depths of this crisis have -- aren't as important right now when there's a ton of opportunity for employment and that is unemployment insurance of the federal top-up but that goes away in early September. So I think when you get kids back in school, we get past these -- hopefully the last wave with Delta and unemployment insurance goes away in the early fall. I think you're going to start to see a significant easing of the issues on the labor side. In terms of, what -- its impact on margins given that we're able to -- while there are service issues all of us are having we're obviously working awfully hard to deliver great service. And I think we are doing a very good job given the difficult circumstances. We are doing it with less labor. And so ironically, given demand and given the ability to price the demand margins are in many cases unbelievably high because you're getting effectively rates that are consistent with what you had before and you can't get the labor so you just have less cost. That obviously, is a temporary thing. You're going to have more labor ultimately in the hotels. Having said that long-term we've done a bunch of things in the crisis in terms of testing and learning on different ways to change the operating model particularly as it relates to housekeeping and food and beverage and then a whole host of other smaller things, where we think we can deliver great experience for our customers and do it more efficiently. And so I think when it all gets flushed through and we're on the other side of this and through the stresses and strains on the labor issues we're talking about I think we have developed a plan to have higher-margin businesses across all the major brands. And so yes, it's a big issue. We're spending a lot of time on it but I do -- as the old adage goes this too I think shall pass. \nRichard Clarke : Thanks very much.\nOperator: And the next question is from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nBill Crow: Thanks. Good morning, Jill. A clarification and a question. The clarification is I think you mentioned that RevPAR was down 29% in June relative to 2019 numbers. And did you say that it was going to be closer to 20% down in the fourth quarter as we pivot to business travel? That's the clarification. \nChris Nassetta: Yes I did. \nBill Crow: The question I guess goes to your discussion about rate being the biggest surprise. I'm just -- I'm wondering if we're already at a point where we can declare victory over rate integrity maybe for the first time in any recovery right, or do we have to wait until we get into business travel and really see what lies beneath this leisure surge?\nChris Nassetta: Yeah. On the first one I answered it, well, maybe you didn't hear, because I was -- and I apologize talking over you. But yes on the first. That's what I said to clarify the first question. You know me Bill, I tend to be a little under promise over deliver is my theory in life, so I don't want to declare victory yet on rate. I meant what I said. I mean I've been doing this a long time and been through bunches of recessions at this point. And what I'm seeing is very atypical. So -- and I do believe that into the fall and next year we're going to continue to have robust demand and improvement. So I think the rate story as I said in my earlier comment, when we look back on it I think that's going to be the real difference in recovery here, but I don't know about declaring victory. George W. Bush did it on an aircraft carrier. It didn't work out for him.\nBill Crow: It didn't work out so well.\nChris Nassetta: Yeah. But listen it's nice to see. It's nice to see, but it's -- again it's just a function of demand. It's then being smart in how do you price demand.\nBill Crow: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning everyone.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: Quick question here and this is just, sort of, looking for a ballpark answer. But with the labor issue out there, what percentage of your hotels right now are unable to sell full inventory due to staffing shortages?\nChris Nassetta: I can't -- I don't have a scientific answer for you. I would say atmospherically I think it's a relatively small percentage of our portfolio. It definitely -- there are definitely some hotels that can't because I've talked to some owners but -- and I was with a bunch of owners out of Dallas this week and labor was probably the number one topic, because it's what everybody's talking about. But I'm not -- I'm just giving you the atmosphere. I don't -- we don't -- I don't have our data on it. I think that it is an issue but not a significant issue. And by the way it's helping to a degree -- it's also helping with rate, because in some markets where they can't they're reducing capacity and driving rate, which by the way back to Bill Crow when we're done with it maybe we can declare victory that we were actually really smart about not only rate recovery, but how we manage occupancy versus rate to drive the best profitability. So in the hotels where they are having issues in many of them, and I can think of a few who I just talked to are having great success in moderating occupancy levels down and then driving it on the top line. And net-net they're making more money than if they had the incremental labor and they opened up the capacity. They're just -- their profitability is higher. So it's not all a bad story. Long-term, obviously, the labor issues we have to sort, I mean, I already gave my answer. I do think they'll sort. There are a bunch of things we're doing to make sure that our system has unique opportunities to access labor and ultimately deliver the service we want to deliver, we do need to get more labor in the hotels. But at the moment from an owner point of view in many cases, some are limiting capacity but I think it's a relatively small percentage.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you for the color. Thanks.\nChris Nassetta: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question will be from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions if I may. Within the franchise fees line item, we're in a moment where it's -- candidly nothing is easy to model I assume for either of us. But that one in particular was much larger than what we had and I know that there is a number of things in there. Getting to franchise fees should be straightforward. But Kevin if you could give us just a little insight on the other pieces that are in there right? There's credit card fees and there are some royalties in there, and how those flow a little modeling would be welcome?\nKevin Jacobs: Yeah. David, it's hard and easy all at the same time. I mean, basically overall fee growth was a bit lower than overall RevPAR growth that's your question. And the real -- the short answer is, yeah, license fees are growing. By the way they're growing really strongly. I think license fees were up something like 80% in the second quarter, but that's obviously a lot less than RevPAR growth at 234%. And so just the math ends up being a little bit less than RevPAR. And so when we -- when we're in this period of RevPAR growth being at these really elevated rates because of the crazy comps, we're going to be a little bit lower than fee growth. On a long-term basis it should be about one to one. So that's the easiest way I can lay it out.\nDavid Katz: Got it.\nKevin Jacobs: Like, we said it's hard to model though. Sorry about that.\nDavid Katz: That's okay. No whatever you got I will take. If I may ask a similar question around, sort of, owned and leased. It's not -- certainly not the biggest part within your model. But if you don't mind my asking any color on sort of how that recovers and grows out in the future would be helpful as well. \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, it's totally fair question. I mean, it's sort of telegraphed a little bit in our prepared remarks again pretty straightforward. I mean that portfolio is concentrated in places like the UK, Central Europe and Japan in particular that are just behind in the trajectory of recovery. So all the things we talked about there's nothing structural there. It's just it's behind. It obviously was loss-making this quarter. It probably will be loss-making next quarter just because of the level of recovery and what's going to be needed in those parts of the world. And we think it's sort of breakeven-ish in Q4. We'll see what happens. Again it's dependent on recovery and the world opening up a little bit. And then the last thing I'd say is obviously it's going to grow more quickly than the core business. So it's going to contribute positively to our growth going forward because it's going to be growing off of a much lower base. \nDavid Katz: Perfect. Appreciate the help. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. \nVince Ciepiel: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the Honors contribution which sounded really high. I think you said around 60%, which is maybe a few points under 2019. And that's all while business transient is still I think 30 points off. I think that usually over-indexes to brand direct. So just curious how you think this direct contribution evolves through the pandemic. Usually there's a narrative that OTAs take share, but it seems like your direct business is really impressive. How do you think it evolves over the course of the next year? \nChris Nassetta: Yes. Well, I -- over the next year it's probably harder to judge. Over the next several years, obviously, our objective is to continue to enhance the value proposition for Honors such that as I've been saying for a long time you're sort of crazy not to be a member of Honors. You get all the technology. You get a little bit of a discounted rate. You get the points. You can use the points to shop on Amazon, buy a concert ticket at Live Nation, go travel the world and get rooms or food and beverage or a spa treatment or whatever. It's very much an opportunity to sort of create value. And if you're not an Honors member and you're staying with us you're sort of silly, I mean just because you're effectively giving away value. And so that happens to be true. Obviously, we've been trying to over the years as I've talked about many times on these calls, sort of, go high and low make sure that for our most frequent travelers it's a really relevant program which I think we've done, but infrequent travelers as well. And that's probably been what's most game-changing for us and I think it's helped us sort of over the last five years lead the industry in percentage of occupancy represented by loyalty, which is we've made it relevant to somebody that travels two or three days a year and not just 60 or 100 days a year because, it's a currency effectively and there's a value proposition that works for them. And so being specific about it we want to continue that. I mean my own view is we were running in the 60s pre-COVID. My goals are much higher for that pre-COVID and I'm not letting up. I mean COVID set us back, but I think COVID also provided opportunities. And as you pointed out in May we were effectively only a couple of points different than we were in 2019. Why would that be when our core traveler is not back? Well I think it's two things. One in May and June our core travelers started to come back. Number two we worked really hard in how we sort of shifted our upper funnel and lower funnel strategies for marketing to attract customers into the system that were traveling during COVID that weren't our core customers. And so we were able to get a bunch of those folks to say, gosh, I would like to be an Honors member and sign up and then realize this is a really good value proposition. So the whole thing during COVID has been to basically say, let's go really hard after the customer that maybe wasn't our core, wasn't an Honors member make sure they really understand the value proposition and then keep them in the system. And then when our core customer comes back obviously we believe we've got a great value proposition and they're staying. And when you put one and one together you hope to get three. And so the objective would be not to get back to where we were because that wasn't the objective pre-COVID. It's to get significantly beyond that. Why? Because we believe it's a better experience for our customer. Like the more -- the better the value proposition the happier they are. The better experience with the technology the happier they are. From an ownership and system point of view we lower our distribution costs. It's the lowest distribution channel -- the lowest cost distribution channel we have. So for all the right reasons we want to continue to build very direct relationships. And my belief is when you wake up in two or three years while COVID has obviously been a difficult time for everybody in the industry including us I do think it afforded us an opportunity to accelerate some of those efforts. \nVince Ciepiel: Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks. \nChris Nassetta: Thanks everybody for the time today. Obviously, we covered a lot of territory and you can probably tell from my comments we're obviously pleased with Q2 relative to where the business has been industry-wide and the company. And we're very bullish about while we know there are risks out there not oblivious to that we think those are all reasonably manageable and we're very bullish about not just the second half of the year, but very bullish about recovery as we go into 2022 and beyond. We look forward -- appreciate time and we'll look forward to catching everybody up after we finish our third quarter. Take care. Have a great day. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis, as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restrictions and surging leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 36.1% compared to 2019. Performance was largely balanced between occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million in the second quarter and those results reflect relaxed travel restrictions and strengthening global demand. Management and franchise fees grew 220%, demonstrating the resiliency of our fee-based business model. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Good morning Joe. Yes. Yes. if the average construction time or gestation period in the pipeline is 2.5 or three years, you've got to be 2.5 or three years past the bottom, before you get back to your old run rate. Yes, Robin, thanks. All good questions I think I've got it. I'll try to go in order. I think on the conversion front openings were lower. I don't remember the exact percentage but they were circa 10% of openings for the quarter. And that was just timing. I'd say last year we were sort of 19% 20% of openings. I think this year it will be that or maybe even a little bit higher given sort of the number of signings we had in the second quarter. And so that's -- I think that's a good way to think about it. And look we are doing more conversions. Very happy with the conversions in the second quarter, really nice mix between hard brands, soft brands, conversions from independents, conversions from other brands regionally. So very happy with that. But that said, our pace of deliveries of new builds is going up as well. So it's sort of hard -- it's a little bit harder for that percentage to move. And of course, that's all baked into our outlook. The idea of -- I'll do the third one next the idea of 2022 being affected not as much. I mean I think 2022 is going to be about what we expect maybe a little bit of timing pull forward replaced by a little bit more conversions. So 2022 is about the same as we thought.  And then yes, you picked up on we said 4% to 5% for the next several years we were not pointing to any one specific year when we said 4% to 5%. And now we're saying mid-single digits which of course 4% to 5% is mid-single digits. So it's about the same but I think what you're hearing is a little bit more optimism about the future of net unit growth given what's been going on lately. Sure. Yeah. David, it's hard and easy all at the same time. I mean, basically overall fee growth was a bit lower than overall RevPAR growth that's your question. And the real -- the short answer is, yeah, license fees are growing. By the way they're growing really strongly. I think license fees were up something like 80% in the second quarter, but that's obviously a lot less than RevPAR growth at 234%. And so just the math ends up being a little bit less than RevPAR. And so when we -- when we're in this period of RevPAR growth being at these really elevated rates because of the crazy comps, we're going to be a little bit lower than fee growth. On a long-term basis it should be about one to one. So that's the easiest way I can lay it out. Like, we said it's hard to model though. Sorry about that. Yes, it's totally fair question. I mean, it's sort of telegraphed a little bit in our prepared remarks again pretty straightforward. I mean that portfolio is concentrated in places like the UK, Central Europe and Japan in particular that are just behind in the trajectory of recovery. So all the things we talked about there's nothing structural there. It's just it's behind. It obviously was loss-making this quarter. It probably will be loss-making next quarter just because of the level of recovery and what's going to be needed in those parts of the world. And we think it's sort of breakeven-ish in Q4. We'll see what happens. Again it's dependent on recovery and the world opening up a little bit. And then the last thing I'd say is obviously it's going to grow more quickly than the core business. So it's going to contribute positively to our growth going forward because it's going to be growing off of a much lower base. Sure."

            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think our second quarter results demonstrate, we continue to make significant progress towards recovery, working hard to serve all of our stakeholders. For our guests to deliver reliable and friendly experiences in a very demanding environment, for our team members to maintain an award-winning culture by creating an inclusive safe and welcoming environment full of opportunities, for our owners to drive value through premium market share and efficient and effective operating models, for our communities to remain a positive force for good at a time when it is needed most, and finally, for our shareholders to maximize profits free cash flow and overall total returns. We're pleased to see that our diligence and determination are beginning to pay off. As much of the world reopens, the pent-up demand for travel we've been anticipating is happening. While the pace of recovery varies and COVID variants remain a risk, we are seeing significant sequential improvement in every major region. In the second quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down 36%, improving 17 percentage points versus the first quarter with June RevPAR improving 24 percentage points versus the first quarter, and down only 29 points versus 2019. Yes. Stephen, thank you. Good question and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world, on the development side, I think, so goes the recovery, sort of, so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. So versus our earlier expectations and why we're a bit more optimistic, obviously, and have raised our outlook for the year is, largely driven by what we were seeing in faster recovery in the U.S. and faster recovery in Asia, really China. And I'd say those are sort of the largest drivers. If you think about recovery, that's where -- as we suggested in the prepared comments, that's where we see the steepest slope of recovery. Europe is, obviously -- we knew would be lagging and isn't contributing as much as the U.S. and China is at this point. But, obviously, our expectation there is, as the U.K. and Europe continue to open, we'll see a meaningful uptick there. So, I think it's pretty much that simple slope of recovery steeper, more activity on the development side in terms of both signings and openings people are back at it and picking up steam. On the conversions, I'd say just modestly better. As you would note from prior calls, we've been -- we've had high expectations for conversions. We have some great conversion brands. The system is performing at the highest levels from a market share point of view than it's ever performed in our history and I think that's a great leading indicator for opportunities to convince folks who are independent to come into the fold as well as folks that have weaker brands that are looking for a better performance to come into the fold, both of which are happening at a little bit better than our expectations. And so, while we had -- we expected things to pick up in the conversion area. I would say this year and then leading into next because a lot of -- some of the signings will take some time. Most of them have pretty quickly, but some of them will take some time in terms of CapEx work, property improvement programs and the like. It's modestly better than what were pretty high expectations. In terms of the financing environment, I mean there's a lot to discuss. I think -- so we can get to lots of other questions. I think the simple answer is, it's improving. I mean the world is a big place. So again, following the slope of recovery, the US and China, I would say the financing markets are recovering most rapidly, because markets are efficient. And performance is starting to really pick up and not just from an occupancy, but you're getting back to rate levels very rapidly, probably more rapidly than I've ever seen in my 40 years of doing this. What happens is the lender community starts to have more confidence. Rates are obviously hyper low and have been low, and lenders need yield. And so, the more comfort they get that recovery is afoot, and that there's going to be a recovery back to where we were and then beyond, the more they're willing to take the risk go a little bit further out on the risk spectrum and underwrite it. And so, you're seeing pretty robust financing markets in China. The US is still -- has a ways to go. I mean you can look at the data out there it's not anywhere near where it was, but it's improving. And my expectation is as you get into the fall, and I'm sure we'll talk about this I'll leave it for other questions. And our belief my belief is that we're going to continue to have very, very strong recovery in the fall, and into next year you're going to continue to see a gradual increase in financing that's available certainly here in the US. I think Europe will take a little longer. So, a ways to go. I'm not saying, it's back anywhere near where it was. It's a long way off. But of sort of off the floors of what we had seen last year. Yes, that's a good question. If you look at the numbers, we had a little bit higher key money in the quarter than we would typically have. What I would say is, I don't see anything that -- I don't think anything is changing materially meaning still over 90% of the deals that we are doing are dry deals. We're not spending -- we're not using the balance sheet anyway. So, there's not any material shift given what's going on in the broader macro environment, the financing markets. Nothing material that shifted. The reason you're seeing a little bit heavier key money spend right now, is a super positive story in the sense that both things that we've been working on for a long time and/or opportunities that have arisen because of the pandemic have sort of come together in an unusual way this year. So, example some of the bigger key money expenditures are iconic assets for our portfolio, largely resort-oriented that we've been working on that will be generational. They'll be in the system for decades and decades and decades. So, the Waldorf Astoria in Monarch Beach and Laguna, I've literally been working on that deal one way or another for 20 years I think, between host and here. And that's in the system an incredible addition to the Waldorf brand. Resorts World, which I talked about in my prepared comments, 3,500 rooms on The Strip, we're basically the only major player on The Strip with a massive meetings platform and 3,500 rooms. We've been working on that for a number of years. Not a crazy amount of key money, by any means, but relative to our normal expenditures is significant. And then the deals that I talked about in Mexico, the three deals 1,500 rooms in Puerto Vallarta and then in Tulum, these are incredible assets that were either existing in the one case and PV was an existing hotel that was operating with another brand. And in the case of Tulum was developed literally over 20 years to get the entitlements with another brand. And because of COVID and what has happened in the industry presented an opportunity for us. And so that allowed us to enter the zone on hotels that would have taken us a decade to sort of pull together and in a matter of six or 12 months we're going to have these purpose-built incredible hotels in the system. And so that's I know a long answer but I view all of those and then there's some others that I'm not going to be mentioning. But those are the big ones that's like incredible progress for us in all-inclusive in resorts and in luxury. And those deals just don't come around that often. We're getting a few more of them now as I said aided by COVID. So, maybe there -- I would say our spending overall is going to be up probably this year and next year relative to 2020 but 2020 was a depressed year. If you look at it versus our normal run rate like 2017, 2018, and 2019, honestly, I think our overall CapEx is sort of going to be within the ranges that we would have been. But again, I don't see anything -- we don't see anything material. We still think over 90% of our deals are going to be dry. And when we have these really unique opportunities even with key money they're very nice returns for us and they're incredibly I think strategic and important to the system. Good morning Joe. Great. Great question. I figured I'd get it and I figured I'd get it early. So, thank you. I know that's on everybody's mind. And we have obviously talked a bunch about it. We ultimately that's a decision we'll go to our board with. We have an upcoming meeting. We've had broader dialogue but we haven't pinned it down. But I said on the last call that I was pretty confident that we would be reinstituting return of capital program next year. I still feel that way. Obviously, the slope of the recovery is even steeper. So, I would say the update to that would be I feel confident that we're going to do in the first half of next year. The exact date and time to be determined when we talk to our Board. But I think you should read the results of second quarter you should read the commentary that Kevin and I gave in our prepared comments plus everything you're hopefully going to get in color to say that we're very optimistic. We know we're not we read the papers I talk to a lot of people. We're not oblivious to the delta variant and things that are going on in the world but we're confident because we think we will power through that. The trends that we see real time are very strong and improving. We feel really good about that going to happen in the fall. And so yes we -- every quarter that goes by I think we feel better and better about where the recovery is going. And so that should ultimately translate into our feeling better about starting to return capital because we'll be generating real significant free cash flow. In my mind, next year and we do not need to hoard it our belief has always been that as I said in my prior answer we're going to be able to keep growing with very little use of our own balance sheet. And so we're going to give it back to folks. So, my expectation is in the first half of next year that program will resume and we'll be having some discussion with our Board in the very near future. Good morning Shaun. Yes, totally fair question. That's the $64,000 question I think everybody is trying to figure out. So, I'll give you I mean we do have some data points and some and I'll give you my opinion on top of it. I mean we've obviously seen, as Kevin and I both described in the nuggets that we gave in our comments that you wouldn't find in the press release, we've seen really nice recovery and that recovery has been across the board. Obviously, the greatest strength in leisure but significant pickup in business travel and significant pickup while -- further to go in the group side. And we continue to see that, notwithstanding the delta variant and all the things going on. Like I got just last night as an example, system-wide US occupancy was 74%, Trailing seven days 74%. That's with the urban markets with some urban hotels not even open and those are in the comp set. And with all of our -- so all of the urban hotels, obviously the urban environment has been lagging a little bit. So what that says to you like last night, if we're running 74%, that's not leisure. I mean, while we have a leisure-oriented hotels, we have a lot of business-oriented hotels. And so mid-week occupancies at that level are definitely reflective of business travel being back. And we've seen it, literally it's funny sort of post Memorial Day, I mean you just saw the shift. You just saw a shift where weekday occupancies went up 10% or 20% at any given night went up 10 or 20 percentage points. And that was business travel dominated by small and medium-sized businesses by the way. But even pre-COVID keep in mind 80% of our business travel was small and medium-sized business, right? So that's sort of currently what's going on. I know your question is forward looking and I promise you I'm going to get to that. I think the trajectory my own view and I think the data sort of supports this, as you get into August what's going to happen is you're going to continue to have massive surge in leisure travel because everybody wants to get out, notwithstanding again the delta variants and the like. We've not seen impact in sort of consumer behavior from that. So I think you're going to have continued very good strength in the leisure. I do think in August you'll -- as you always do, you will see business transient fall off a little bit, right just because people are going to be like they always do, they're going to be not traveling for business as much and going on more vacations. And it's sort of the last hurrah before maybe a lot of people going back to work. And the kids are finally going back to school and all that fun stuff. But when you get to the fall and limited -- we have limited data obviously this far out. So this is -- I gave you data points that I have real time today. When you get 60, 90 days out, business transient stats a lot of the bookings haven't occurred. So this is where it gets into my view of what I think will happen. I think you get after Labor Day, I do believe -- I'm not a health expert, but I'm talking to a lot of them. I do believe we will have powered through the Delta thing, if you look at the stats on hospitalization and the like, they're really not terrible. If you look at what's happened in the UK and we're sort of three or four weeks behind them, the patterns there right now are quite good. They have infection rates down 50% on a trailing 12 day basis over there. So I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic that we sort of power through that. And when we get to the fall, here's what I think we do know, kids are going back to school. I mean, we'll debate whether they're wearing masks or not. Some places, yes but they're going back to school and I'm pretty confident in that. And offices are opening. I mean they may open different times. Some people you're reading you're going to push it a month or whatever. Obviously, I said we're open. We're open and operating here at our -- at all of our headquarters. But you're going to have people back at work which means with kids in school, with baby sitters and with people in the office, you're going to have more propensity to want to travel. And when we talk to customers, again, I can't give you the booking data because it's too far out. When we talk to customers anecdotally, it supports all of that that when you get into the fall, people are going to be traveling. There's both pent-up demand okay, if things they've been needing to do and then there's just demand, generally to -- for folks to be able to run their businesses. And so I think as you get into the fall, you're going to see the natural reduction in the leisure as we always do because now kids are in school. They weren't last year. Kids are in school, people are back in the office, they don't have as much time to go on vacation. I do believe again, I can't prove it, but my belief is leisure will be elevated for a while because we're still living in a bit of a hybrid world. But I think business transient will come back. Group will obviously take a little longer gestation period, but group will definitely be coming back the booking trends into the third, particularly the fourth quarter are much better than they've been. And I think we're motoring forward. In terms of -- last time, I believe I said that I think we'd be back to sort of 70% by the end of the year of 2019 levels. And obviously, I feel better. So while we're not giving guidance, so I'm not going to do it. We're not ready to start doing that. There's still enough uncertainty we want to wait. We do do forecast, okay? I mean we're not -- it's not Camp Runamuck here. We are looking at our numbers. And I'd say our view is demand levels probably -- RevPAR levels are probably in the US and globally somewhere circa 80% versus the 70% I thought. In our current thinking demand levels probably back to 85%. So we're getting there. And we're -- I mean again, much -- I said last time recovery has been much steeper than we thought. I say it again today. Just things have been coming back more quickly than we would have thought. We knew they'd come back. Obviously, you all know I've been optimistic about the recovery but it's even better than I would have thought. I think one of the most surprising things, although it shouldn't be to any of us because as I kid our team the laws of economics are alive and well. And the most surprising thing is how quickly rate comes back. But that's \u2013 again that's just demand, right? We're pricing demand, we're being really smart about it. But I do believe when this \u2013 when we look back on this recovery the most unusual thing relative to any other period of my almost 40 years of doing this will be just a rapid return of rate. Yes. Yes. Still \u2013 great question still building. What I said is that all of our bookings for 2022 are at rates that are greater than 2019. So to be specific rate. I didn't say volume. Volume is still a bit off just because it takes time to build the book. So my expectation is we get closer to next year and in the next year. In the year for the \u2013 later in this year, particularly when you get past this Delta, the Delta wave and then in the year for the year we'll be a barn burner year bigger than anything we've ever seen in the year for the year simply because people have to meet. It takes time to plan it. They want to sort of get through their budget season before they know how much money they have. But I'm not worried about the volumes next year. Again they're a bit \u2013 they're not where we were at 2019. They're close but they're not there but the rate is above. And so what I've been \u2013 honestly, what I've been saying to our teams is be really careful like we \u2013 there's going to be a monumental amount of demand we don't want to give it away. We want to make sure that we're pricing. Even though we're not at the volumes now, my expectation very strongly is it's all going to fill in. It just takes it a little bit longer given what's the reason for this recession being a health issue. And sort of getting through the final stages of that in my opinion is required before you really get the momentum on the volume. And so that's why rates are up is because we're being super disciplined recognizing that there's a limited amount of meeting space, there's going to be a gargantuan amount of demand and we can be a bit patient I think given what's going on. Yes I do. And I think it's probably sometime between 2023 and 2024 Kevin? Kevin is also Head of Development. So I want to make sure he's \u2013 before I commit to him. Yes, I think it's sometime in 2023, 2024. Probably more 2024 just because you got to get through the \u2013 if you look at starts last year, you'd look at \u2013 I mean if you look at the progression you'll see when we're done last year we were down in starts. This year we'll be down modestly, not nearly as much as last year in starts. And I think that's the bottom. And then I think next year we'll be ramping up in starts. And I think if you just play that through that's what gets us in the mid-single digits for the next sort of couple of years two or three and then I think you're back in business in the 6% to 7% range. Yes thanks Rick. It's a great question. Labor shortage is a real issue, probably the single biggest issue that we're dealing with that is definitely not just for Hilton but industry -- all service industries and manufacturing and a lot of your supply chain issues that you're reading about every day. All of this is sort of interconnected to not having enough labor. At a high level, I think it will largely resolve itself over the next couple of quarters in the sense that I think there are a lot of complex reasons behind it. Some of it is obviously health. People still don't feel like particularly with the Delta variant now that they should go back to work, some people because they're worried about their health as already `been -- we haven't had kids in schools, so we don't effectively have day care. There are women in the workforce or where it's been most dramatically impacted because they have to stay home to take care of kids. And then some of the government programs that were really important last year in the depths of this crisis have -- aren't as important right now when there's a ton of opportunity for employment and that is unemployment insurance of the federal top-up but that goes away in early September. So I think when you get kids back in school, we get past these -- hopefully the last wave with Delta and unemployment insurance goes away in the early fall. I think you're going to start to see a significant easing of the issues on the labor side. In terms of, what -- its impact on margins given that we're able to -- while there are service issues all of us are having we're obviously working awfully hard to deliver great service. And I think we are doing a very good job given the difficult circumstances. We are doing it with less labor. And so ironically, given demand and given the ability to price the demand margins are in many cases unbelievably high because you're getting effectively rates that are consistent with what you had before and you can't get the labor so you just have less cost. That obviously, is a temporary thing. You're going to have more labor ultimately in the hotels. Having said that long-term we've done a bunch of things in the crisis in terms of testing and learning on different ways to change the operating model particularly as it relates to housekeeping and food and beverage and then a whole host of other smaller things, where we think we can deliver great experience for our customers and do it more efficiently. And so I think when it all gets flushed through and we're on the other side of this and through the stresses and strains on the labor issues we're talking about I think we have developed a plan to have higher-margin businesses across all the major brands. And so yes, it's a big issue. We're spending a lot of time on it but I do -- as the old adage goes this too I think shall pass. Yes I did. Yeah. On the first one I answered it, well, maybe you didn't hear, because I was -- and I apologize talking over you. But yes on the first. That's what I said to clarify the first question. You know me Bill, I tend to be a little under promise over deliver is my theory in life, so I don't want to declare victory yet on rate. I meant what I said. I mean I've been doing this a long time and been through bunches of recessions at this point. And what I'm seeing is very atypical. So -- and I do believe that into the fall and next year we're going to continue to have robust demand and improvement. So I think the rate story as I said in my earlier comment, when we look back on it I think that's going to be the real difference in recovery here, but I don't know about declaring victory. George W. Bush did it on an aircraft carrier. It didn't work out for him. Yeah. But listen it's nice to see. It's nice to see, but it's -- again it's just a function of demand. It's then being smart in how do you price demand. Good morning. I can't -- I don't have a scientific answer for you. I would say atmospherically I think it's a relatively small percentage of our portfolio. It definitely -- there are definitely some hotels that can't because I've talked to some owners but -- and I was with a bunch of owners out of Dallas this week and labor was probably the number one topic, because it's what everybody's talking about. But I'm not -- I'm just giving you the atmosphere. I don't -- we don't -- I don't have our data on it. I think that it is an issue but not a significant issue. And by the way it's helping to a degree -- it's also helping with rate, because in some markets where they can't they're reducing capacity and driving rate, which by the way back to Bill Crow when we're done with it maybe we can declare victory that we were actually really smart about not only rate recovery, but how we manage occupancy versus rate to drive the best profitability. So in the hotels where they are having issues in many of them, and I can think of a few who I just talked to are having great success in moderating occupancy levels down and then driving it on the top line. And net-net they're making more money than if they had the incremental labor and they opened up the capacity. They're just -- their profitability is higher. So it's not all a bad story. Long-term, obviously, the labor issues we have to sort, I mean, I already gave my answer. I do think they'll sort. There are a bunch of things we're doing to make sure that our system has unique opportunities to access labor and ultimately deliver the service we want to deliver, we do need to get more labor in the hotels. But at the moment from an owner point of view in many cases, some are limiting capacity but I think it's a relatively small percentage. Yeah. Yes. Well, I -- over the next year it's probably harder to judge. Over the next several years, obviously, our objective is to continue to enhance the value proposition for Honors such that as I've been saying for a long time you're sort of crazy not to be a member of Honors. You get all the technology. You get a little bit of a discounted rate. You get the points. You can use the points to shop on Amazon, buy a concert ticket at Live Nation, go travel the world and get rooms or food and beverage or a spa treatment or whatever. It's very much an opportunity to sort of create value. And if you're not an Honors member and you're staying with us you're sort of silly, I mean just because you're effectively giving away value. And so that happens to be true. Obviously, we've been trying to over the years as I've talked about many times on these calls, sort of, go high and low make sure that for our most frequent travelers it's a really relevant program which I think we've done, but infrequent travelers as well. And that's probably been what's most game-changing for us and I think it's helped us sort of over the last five years lead the industry in percentage of occupancy represented by loyalty, which is we've made it relevant to somebody that travels two or three days a year and not just 60 or 100 days a year because, it's a currency effectively and there's a value proposition that works for them. And so being specific about it we want to continue that. I mean my own view is we were running in the 60s pre-COVID. My goals are much higher for that pre-COVID and I'm not letting up. I mean COVID set us back, but I think COVID also provided opportunities. And as you pointed out in May we were effectively only a couple of points different than we were in 2019. Why would that be when our core traveler is not back? Well I think it's two things. One in May and June our core travelers started to come back. Number two we worked really hard in how we sort of shifted our upper funnel and lower funnel strategies for marketing to attract customers into the system that were traveling during COVID that weren't our core customers. And so we were able to get a bunch of those folks to say, gosh, I would like to be an Honors member and sign up and then realize this is a really good value proposition. So the whole thing during COVID has been to basically say, let's go really hard after the customer that maybe wasn't our core, wasn't an Honors member make sure they really understand the value proposition and then keep them in the system. And then when our core customer comes back obviously we believe we've got a great value proposition and they're staying. And when you put one and one together you hope to get three. And so the objective would be not to get back to where we were because that wasn't the objective pre-COVID. It's to get significantly beyond that. Why? Because we believe it's a better experience for our customer. Like the more -- the better the value proposition the happier they are. The better experience with the technology the happier they are. From an ownership and system point of view we lower our distribution costs. It's the lowest distribution channel -- the lowest cost distribution channel we have. So for all the right reasons we want to continue to build very direct relationships. And my belief is when you wake up in two or three years while COVID has obviously been a difficult time for everybody in the industry including us I do think it afforded us an opportunity to accelerate some of those efforts. Thanks everybody for the time today. Obviously, we covered a lot of territory and you can probably tell from my comments we're obviously pleased with Q2 relative to where the business has been industry-wide and the company. And we're very bullish about while we know there are risks out there not oblivious to that we think those are all reasonably manageable and we're very bullish about not just the second half of the year, but very bullish about recovery as we go into 2022 and beyond. We look forward -- appreciate time and we'll look forward to catching everybody up after we finish our third quarter. Take care. Have a great day."

Over that time, we acted swiftly to address the challenges we face so we could quickly turn our focus to best positioning ourselves towards recovery and beyond. I'm really proud of how we've set up the company for the future. And most importantly, I'm grateful to our team members who have continued to lead with hospitality and to all of our stakeholders for their ongoing support. In the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR decreased 38% year-over-year and 53% versus 2019. Rising COVID cases and tightening travel restrictions particularly across Europe and Asia Pacific weighed on demand through January and most of February, March marked a turning point as we lapped the start of the U.S. lockdowns RevPAR turned positive of more than 23% year-over-year. System-wide occupancy reached 55% by the end of the month, driven by strong leisure demand. As expected recovery in group and corporate transit continued to lag but both segments showed sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter. Overall, this positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. While recovery varies by region and country, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter system-wide RevPAR declined 38.4% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis as rising COVID cases and reinstated travel restrictions and lockdowns disrupted the demand environment, especially across Europe and Asia Pacific. However, occupancy improved sequentially throughout the quarter, increasing more than 20 points. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million in the first quarter down 45% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management franchise fees decreased 34% less than RevPAR decreased as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better than expected license fees and development fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenged demand environment, reinstated lock downs and travel restrictions in Europe and Japan coupled with temporary hotel closures and fixed operating costs including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties weighed on our performance. Continued cost control mitigated segment losses. For the quarter diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.02.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move to our question-and-answer session.  And the first question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: So Chris, Kevin, you guys gave some helpful data points around kind of the acceleration that you saw throughout the first quarter. And speaking more maybe on the U.S. front, could guys maybe talk a little bit about, March and maybe to the extent you're willing to April and how kind of not only RevPAR trends, I know, you gave some data points on occupancy, with the 55% exit rate coming out of March, kind of what you've seen from a fee generation on the U.S. side as it pertains to the occupancy gains. And then, perhaps how you're thinking about beyond people coming back into the office, the aspect of pent up demand within the business and corporate traveler as we get maybe it's probably a fourth few event, I think most of us would assume at this point. But how do you guys think about that?\nChris Nassetta: Boy, that's a lot of questions all embedded into one. But that is probably the most important; I'll cover parts of it. Maybe Kevin will throw some things in. And we'll save a little bit maybe for later, because I'm sure there is a lot of similar questions, but thank you. And I do think that is the question, obviously as both Kevin and I covered Carlo, we saw, pretty marked improvement, as we march through the quarter. And that continued into April. In terms of the global data, I think the best way to look at it is against, a 19 comparison, because looking at it against, 2020, particularly right now, as you were in the early stages of the pandemic is relatively useless. And so, if you look at January and February, you were globally and the U.S. was similar, if you look at it, you were sort of in the 55% to 60%, down from a RevPAR power point of view. And you picked up about 10 points, going down into the -- sort of the mid 40s down in March. And then, in April, you had another step up and into the low 40s. Obviously, made a little early to say but I would say that trajectory in our mind continues if we look at forward bookings both. On the leisure transient side, which is what's going to dominate the second quarter, it feels like we're going to continue marching on. If you look at it by segments, which I you know, obviously, it's been a lot of time and this will sort of get to some of our views on the business transient and the group side. If you look at it, you break down room nights by segments relative to 2019. Again, I'm focusing on room nights to sort of take rate for the moment out of it. Leisure in the first quarter was already close to 90% of 19. By the way, for what it's worth, much lower based on lower rated business, but just again, room nights. And business was about 50% in the first quarter, again, lower if you look at it, on a RevPAR basis. And group was about 35 to 40. As you march through, our expectations for the year, our belief is globally and every region will be a little bit different. And I'll save a regional question for somebody else, because I don't want to do too much of a filibuster on one question. But if you march through, the year, my expectation is, you're going to have an incredibly robust, leisure driven summer. So we're going to continue to see good progress. We believe the summer will be meaningfully over 2019 peak levels of leisure demand as we get into the fall and every day, you're reading the same things I'm reading, but I'm also as I'm sure you are talking to a lot of CEOs of large companies that we deal with or that are friends of mine. And I think, clearly, as you get into the summer, many people are starting to bring folks back in the office, certainly, as you get into the fall, all things, sort of being equal in terms of trajectory, vaccination, most businesses are going to be bringing folks back maybe not fully, probably not fully, but on some flexible basis. But a whole lot different than what we've been experiencing. We do believe that and we do see it both in China, as I said in my prepared comments, we do see it in parts of the United States, where restrictions have been lifted earlier, I mentioned in my prepared comments, business travel volumes already 75% of what they were in '19 in those markets. So I think it is -- even though not fully through it not fully open anywhere, I think it is really good evidence that as people get back to work as kids in the fall, go back-to-school, which at this point, I think is very highly likely you are going to see a step change into the third and fourth quarter in business transients. I also see it in our booking pace on the group side that you will see a pretty good step change in the group side, I gave you some stats, so I won't repeat them. At the moment, it is more Smurf kind of related business and small meetings in the second half of this year with the bigger meetings, really some happening but really those getting booked more into next year at a high volume. But we do believe that that we will have a lot of realized group business a lot more of it than we've been experiencing in the second half of the year. So if you sort of jumped to the fourth quarter, recognizing Q2 is going to be largely leisure, Q3 is going to sort of be a transition on a room night basis. Our forecasting, which is all it is, but it's based on a lot of data. And then based on sort of the current trajectory that we're on, we think room nights and leisure will be at 19 levels. We don't think rates will be back to 19 levels. So sort of RevPAR levels in the leisure sort of in the low 80s sort of percent. We think business transient and by the time you get to the fourth quarter based on what we're seeing in markets that are recovering on a room night basis will be about 70%-ish. I'm being reasonably precise, obviously, but these are sort of our sense of estimate. And obviously, lower than that on a RevPAR basis, because we're still not going to have the all the highest rated business travel back. That's why it takes time to sort of get back to 19 levels. And we think group from a volume point of view could be halfway back to 19 levels. Again, it won't be the highest rated groups, those will start coming next year when we get to a place where we have the larger groups, association, etc, that are typically are paying. So that's sort of -- that's how we think the year is going to play out. We think that, as a result, RevPAR levels every sort of month as we go versus 19 are going to get better. By the time we end the year, I think we could be back somewhere around 70% or something-ish of 19 levels on a run rate basis, which isn't all the way home, but is a heck of a lot, better than where we were and what I would say not to be pollyannaish about it, what I would say is, the recovery of late, certainly since we had our last call the recovery, the slope of the recovery has been steeper than what we would have thought in all regards. Now, a lot of it has to come on the business trends, that we're seeing some as I described, not like we have none. And we're seeing a pretty decent up tick. But that is sort of a fall expectation. But I would say broadly, as you can probably tell from my comments, there's a bunch of data to support it, we think the slope of the recovery has steepened since the last time we talked. And thus, our reason for optimism, the things are on a good path. You asked about fee generation that will follow and I don't think there's a whole lot more to say that, as the business recovers, so go our fees, that's how we get paid. And I do think sort of built into my expectations that I gave us sort of my view and our view of pent up demand. I think there's a huge amount of pent up demand. And my guess is every single person that you guys talk to whether they run a business, whether you talk to him, they're a friend of yours, you see him on the beach, or wherever you are, that they're talking about needing to and wanting to get out both for leisure but increasingly needing to and wanting to get out for business and to congregate in groups. There are a lot of important work to get done in these group settings that I think after a while people realize that that is not possible to keep going without it. So I do think there's a -- I think we're on a real -- on a very good slope, we need the vaccination trends and the infection rates and all of the fun stuff that we're all looking at, every minute of every day, because that's all the media is covering, obviously, we need all that to progress. But our view is, we're on a very solid road to recovery. Did I get most of what you wanted? I let a few nuggets for somebody else to ask about.\nCarlo Santarelli: Yes. I don\u2019t drive corporate tunnel for writing. So I appreciate the response. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: I think most of my demands related, recovery related questions were sufficiently answered before. So I just like to talk about the development pipeline, nice to see that up sequentially, on a quarter-over-quarter basis. What we've been seeing for a while now is that the non-U.S. component is becoming a bigger percentage of the pipeline. How much of the non-U.S. is limited service? And how did that composition -- how did that compared to maybe a year ago? And maybe where I'm going with this question is when you look at the average fee per room, in your development pipeline now versus a year ago? Is that average fee per room up or down?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, that's a good question. I think those trends are not changing dramatically in the short term, right? They sort of stay, we've got a pretty good development pipeline, both in full service and limited service, you have seen growth, I mean, primarily through our master limited partnerships in China with Hampton and Home2. But also, as we deploy Hilton Garden Inn and other brands around the world, you are seeing slightly faster growth in limited service. So for it to change the overall trajectory of fees per room, it will take a really long time. And so that has been pretty steady, as has the mix between full service and limited service generally speaking in both the pipeline of rooms under construction, I think it's about 60:40, full service limited service. And that stayed pretty constant. All the other way, sorry, 40:60.\nOperator: Next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Chris, or Kevin, maybe to stick with the same development topic. Inflation has become a big theme around all the markets recently. And I just want to get your thoughts on specifically what this could mean for the hotel development side? Are you seeing or hearing about any changes or delays that could be out there as a result of things like materials inflation? Is this particular concern to you at all and how you're underwriting or what you're starting to hear back from your development teams?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, I mean, of course, it's a concern. I mean, we haven't sort of inflation going on, not just in the input costs, but labor as well. So when they ultimately -- when people need to operate, open and operate, the costs are higher. Now we've done a bunch of things and are doing a bunch of things to bring costs down inside the hotels by creating really good efficiencies that I think will more than offset that component of it. But costs to build are going up and financing is not particularly readily available for the best owners it is and people are starting new build projects in the U.S. and around the world. But, I suspect and sort of built in, Shawn, to our expectations on the unit growth is that the U.S., you will see a cycle where particularly in the U.S., the new construction numbers are going to be much, much lower, that's obviously long-term healthy for the industry. But the good news for us is the world is a big place and the pressures are not the same in all places in the world, particularly recognizing that the place where we get the second biggest chunk of our growth is Asia Pacific and China in particular. And those, those pressures are very different in the sense that they're less and there's a lot more financing available, etc, etc. And so, not unlike coming out of the Great Recession, our job is to be really resilient. This is the benefit of an investment in a big global company. I think we're really good at this and sort of anticipating and adapting to the trends. And like, after the Great Recession, the same thing happened in the U.S., there wasn't so much an inflationary so there was just a dearth of capital and new construction starts went way down, that's what's happening here, that'll be healthy for the industry and what did we do, we pivoted then the same way. We're pivoting now, just with more tools in the toolkit, meaning conversions become a much larger part of what we're doing. And we are much further along in terms of the relationships we have around the world, in the areas of the world that are continuing, to not only motor along, but pick up steam. I mean, I think China is an example, in our second biggest market, we're going to sign more, start more and open more deals, than I think we ever have this year, right. And so, diversification is a powerful thing. Ultimately, I do believe the pressures on the cost to build will abate over a period of time and I don't think it'll be that long a period of time, I'm highly confident that the financing markets will -- have been easing up and will continue to ease up and the U.S. in terms of new development, or new construction starts will be a huge engine of opportunity for us, as it always has been and pick up a lot of steam. And I'm sure other things around the world will happen over time where they slow down. But, we're very quick on our feet, not to pat us on the back too much. But I think we've been able for 15 years to continue to drive really good growth. While lots of crazy things are going on around the world, because there are different conditions and there's ways to continue to grow. And so, while we do starting -- finishing with where I started, we do worry about it. I think we have a plan to address it. I think we've built that into the expectations that we've provided to you guys in terms of where we think growth will be.\nOperator: Next question will be from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: On capital allocation, what are the key factors you are considering and bringing back the dividend and/or buyback and thinking through just capital allocation priorities more broadly?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, I think, look, the second part maybe is a little more straightforward. Our overall view on capital allocation hasn't changed. Obviously, we've suspended dividend and buyback to preserve liquidity during the pandemic, but the way we think about it broadly hasn't changed. And I think the way we think about it, more specifically on the first part of your question is, we want to get a little further into the recovery, a little bit further into reliably generating free cash -- positive free cash flow and having our leverage levels start to come down. And so that, unless something crazy happens, we think that happens over the course of the year, we'll talk to our board about it sort of in the second half of the year as the recovery takes shape. And we'd say it's highly likely that starting next year, we get back into the capital return business.\nOperator: And the next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: Hearing your earlier comments, the slope of recoveries are better than expected, Chris, what's your latest thinking on when RevPAR gets back to 2019 levels?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. That's a great question. Actually, Thomas, thanks for asking. It is one that we were debating over the last few days ourselves. And there are varying opinions on it even in inside our own shop. I mean, I've been saying 23 or 24, as you know, on these calls publicly and I still believe that I think with the slope of the recovery I'd probably be on the earlier end of that, rather than the later, as we have a little bit more visibility. I think there is a chance from a room night point of view, certainly on a run rate basis that we get back next year. But I think to get both room nights and rate and the compression we need requires certainly in the U.S. that broadly requires the bigger groups to be back. And while I think they're coming back and certainly they want to be back, the planning and all of that, say it's on a lag. So I think that takes some time next year. So I still say 23, 24, but I'd probably hear towards the earlier end of that.\nOperator: The next question will be from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I kind of along the same lines, you see the acceleration, in RevPAR, in your conversations, really on the corporate side, for groups less on the association side? Do you sense any hesitancy on the part of corporates to move back in terms of having enjoyed a year of essentially no travel budgets, any kind of pushback that you think in terms of the amount of people they put on the road? Or the amount of people they put into groups? Or is that not really an issue and it just put a pegging off this idea of impairment?\nChris Nassetta: It's another reason I think it takes time to get back to 19 levels, sort of picking up my earlier answer is because I do think, not only people cut budgets, not everybody, was Amazon or whatever and that has really benefited during this time a lot. Most businesses by number have been really negatively impacted by the pandemic and they need to cut expenses. And so I'm highly confident, as is the case with any cyclical downturn and recovery, when this happens that those budgets will build back, but it will take some time. Now, I think in the second half of this year, I think, number one, there's a huge amount of pent up demand. And by definition, they only have half a year to spend whatever they have anyway, because nobody's going to doing a ton of traveling in the first half of the year. So I think, ironically, I think there's plenty of budget capacity, I look at our own budget, there's plenty of budget capacity, when you talk to businesses for the rest of this year. I think as you go into next year, if we're in a full scale recovery, while people are going to, for a period of time, want to be thrifty. I think in the end, it'll just be what the opportunity set is. And if we're in a robust recovery, what I have seen again, I can't prove it, but I've seen it in every other cycle as you get into that, the rope gets, businesses let the rope through their hands, because they have to, they have to deliver alpha, they have to compete against other businesses that are trying to do the same thing. And so, their people have to get out on the road, they have to have meetings, they have to build their culture, innovate, collaborate, get out, get their sales forces out and do all the things they do. So, the steeper the slope of the recovery, like in every other cyclical recovery and that's when we get through the pandemic, we're done largely with the health, then you're in a cyclical economic recovery, the steeper the slope, the faster it comes back. That's just the way it's always worked. I don't think it'll be any different here. But that's why I said 23, 24. I, again, I said probably I'd take the earlier of that the rather than the later given the current slope of what we're seeing. But that's why it takes longer, we will get back to room nights, I think faster, because we'll still find room nights that are lower rated business, because we've gotten really good at that. But we're going to want to shift the mix out over the next couple of years to the higher rated business, get more compression from groups to ultimately get back there. So I think budgets will normalize, sort of between now and 2023, if the slope of the recovery is what we think, is what we're seeing.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Covered a lot of territory already. But I wanted to just talk about the development in general. And, we have not talked much about the degree to which the interactions with owners, maybe changed either temporarily or permanently. We've been so focused on the demand recovery, which obviously is worthy of consuming our attention. But is there any semi-permanent or permanent change and the manner in which you deal with the development community and sort of how those monies and risks are managed long-term.\nChris Nassetta: It's a complicated answer, I think when you boil it down, I don't think there is going to be any material shift. I do believe, obviously, short to intermediate term, there's a shift because like everybody, not all of our owners, but most of our owners are dealing with a very difficult situation, I would say that 99.9% now, some of them are much further along in recovery, because their portfolios are in markets that have had rapid recovery resort market, southern U.S., and they're doing pretty well. But broadly, the owner community, obviously, has been hurting, as have we, as have the whole industry, there's not -- it's not like, it's been easy on any of us. We obviously have deployed a whole host of things to be supportive of the owner community and those are still fully deployed, in the sense of working very hard with a lot of folks on behalf of the industry for government support in the right areas and we don't -- we have not stopped those efforts. And I do believe as we get to a real recovery there's opportunities to get help with real stimulus to get people moving again. And so we continue to work, day and night, on those efforts as things evolve. And obviously, we've done, a whole bunch of work in the short-term to provide massive amounts of relief from standards across the board, so that owners could -- make manage their way, we could all manage our way to the other side, I've mentioned it in passing. But it's worth mentioning, again, we call it our hotel, the future work, we were looking in a very granular way across every one of our brands. We're not done with the work but we were done with a lot of the work to figure out when we get to the other side, how do we deliver the incredible experience for the customer that continues to drive the premiums that we've had, by the way, which is the highest levels in our history at this moment. But also do it in a way that's more cost efficient for our ownership community. I'm highly confident, as I said, even with the labor pressures that we are going to experience here in the U.S. particularly, that when it's all said and done, we're going to be able to drive higher margins. So on a like-for-like basis, if you believe which I do, that, when you get out a couple years, you're going to have similar demand levels to '18 or '19 even with the cost pressures, we believe that we have that we have engineered a way to be able to drive even greater returns. So our owners, while it's difficult, now when we get the other side, both their existing assets and their opportunity set for doing a new development, we think are going to be better than what we had pre-pandemic, because we think we were just doing a better -- we're going to do we are and will continue to do a better job. And so that's a long winded way of getting to the answer, which I gave you at the beginning. So as a result of that, I don't think they'll be a meaningful difference. I mean, with some owners, there may be but I would say, in the main I don't think so, I think the owner community, that we deal with which is an immensely diversified community, we have 10,000 owners around the world that we deal with, the vast majority of them, this is their business. This is what they do, own and operate on a franchise basis. And it's all they do. It's not the case across all 10,000 owners, but the bulk of our system, this is what people do. And I don't think if we can deliver for them, the premiums we've delivered, which have only gone up and do it in a way where they can get more of the bottom-line, that they're going to abandon their business model. I think they're don\u2019t want to carry on. But it takes some time, right, this being pragmatic, because this has been really difficult, and which is why we've worked so hard to sort of help create the bridges both and what we could do, what the government could do to get them the other side. And why I said in, honestly, in my earlier comments, particularly in the U.S. where why I think the new development side and all of these pressures and just the pressures of owners, broadly is going to mean, it's going to take a little time for the new construction side of development to pick up what it was pre-pandemic, but that will happen in my opinion. And I think the relationship will be much more similar than different to what it was. And as I said before, in the meantime, it's a big world and we've pivoted and we're doing some really cool things around the world to make sure that we continue to enhance our network effect and deliver more hotels and more fees.\nOperator: The next question is from Richard Clarke with Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Just a quick question on the owned and leased portfolio, obviously, that seems to have driven the most volatility in the quarter. Where do your ambitions with that particular division stand? Are you looking to transition that more rapidly towards asset light now? And where do you think the cost savings in that segment can land in the longer term?\nKevin Jacob: Well, the cost savings, look, it's everything across the board, just like any hotel owner would be doing in times like this, we're looking for cost savings in sort of literally every aspect of the operations. I think our ambitions in that portfolio, we are pretty capital aid, right? So even in normal times, that ownership was down to 7% to 8% of our overall EBITDA, something like that in 2019. And we've been saying for a long time that if we think about -- we think about our portfolio, it's about 60 hotels, primarily leases, about 20 of them were strategic, we'll be in those leases, no matter what, over time, they have good coverage, they're important hotels, we've got 20 at the bottom, where they're sort of legacy -- their legacy deals that we inherited fixed lease payments in markets that aren't as robust, those we will exit no matter what, when the leases are up. And then, there's about 20, that are in the middle, where when the leases roll, we sit down with the landlord, and if we can work out an arrangement that we think makes sense for us to continue, we continue, if we don't, we get out. And we've sort of enrolling our way out of three to four of them a year, we think it's actually probably more like six to eight of them this year, that will transition out of either transitioning them to management agreements, or franchise agreements, or just getting out. And over time, you'll wake up a few years from now and it'll be something like less than 5% of our overall EBITDA and that will remain the trajectory.\nChris Nassetta: Having said that, in the next -- starting in the second half of the year and into the next couple of years, this will accelerate our overall growth, just because, sadly, the ownership segment given a lot of the fixed rent nature of it and where it's been, which has been concentrated in U.K., Europe and Japan, which have been impacted, dramatically, more impacted. If you look at the RevPAR numbers in those markets and in the segment are twice as bad in the first quarter as the overall. As you get those markets open, you're going to take those numbers, which have been terrible, will become a significant contributor to growth.\nKevin Jacob: Yes. And we think that happens over the course of the second half of the year.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great. Yes, I had a question going back to the unit growth topic. One is, I wonder if you have thoughts about 22 unit growth. The rate, you mentioned U.S. new construction, obviously, would be lower, kind of how that would compare to this year's 4.5% to 5%. And then, also on that topic, the conversions in this quarter, I think we're 20 some percent of openings. Do you see that moving higher? In other words, are you in the early stages of budget conversions that maybe will come out later this year? I know you've talked in the past about how pressures in the business can lead to a greater rate of conversion. So wondering if that's teeing up for later this year? And then, could that offset the lower new construction growth next year? Thanks.\nChris Nassetta: Yes, sure, Robin, good questions. I think, look, in the first part, I think we've said, several times publicly that we think over the next several years, it'll be between 4% and 5%. And, sort of the range there is meant to capture sort of all of the things we've been talking about, right, the timing of openings, the timing of conversions, the timing of removals, the trajectory that we're seeing in new construction. So we still think 4% to 5%, it'll be within that range for the next few years. And then, the second half on conversions, yes, we do you think conversions will pick up over time. In the last cycle, it got to something in the 40% range of overall deliveries probably doesn't get and we've think we've said this publicly as well, probably doesn't get back to that level. This cycle just because the denominator likely won't contract that dramatically, but we do think conversions will continue to be bigger contributor, it'll be a little bit lumpy a lot of them are larger hotels, some of the things we're working on now or bigger deals either portfolio deals or larger individual hotels that sort of require a transaction to happen for the conversion to happen. So I don't know if that happens later this year or next year, but it definitely will pick up over time.\nOperator: The next question is from Bill Crow from Raymond James.\nBill Crow: Looking globally, how important is outbound Chinese travel to the recovery in Europe? And are there any comments you can make on the trends about on Chinese travel to that?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, I mean, we've been having a lot of discussion within the industry. And within China, in fact, I participated in a meeting with the Premier Li of China, just a couple of weeks ago and this is one of the topics that we talked about. If you look at our business, using some metrics, in our business, like in the U.S., international, inbound, only about 4% of the business, if you look at our business globally, it's about 10%. And it does weigh, obviously, more heavily inbound business in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe, which depends on it more. So would be higher than 10%, a large feeder market is China, I mean, its other parts of the world as well, but it's China. And so I think as Europe opens up, obviously, they're going to be like the rest of the world, I think they're going to be doing, within region travel, which given all the pent up demand, as actually I think been reasonably good, just like we're seeing in the U.S., even though we don't have much inbound travel going on, we don't have any outbound going on. And so I think, in the end Europe's opportunity for the early stages of recovery are robust for the same reason, while they're not going to have inbound from China, or other markets, they're not going to have any outbound and Europeans like to travel and particularly in the summer, like to go on vacations and when it's open and they can, they will and they'll stay within the confines of either their countries or the region. So I think I think it's going to be fine. Obviously, longer term, as you get some more stabilized world, you want to open up these travel quarters, I had a meeting with the White House last week, maybe the week before they said with Premier Li of China, the week before that. And we were talking about a lot of topics, but that was a primary topic both was the Chinese administration and the U.S. administration on trying to figure out how do we figure out as the world is getting vaccinated and it's a little uneven, but as certain countries are getting heavily vaccinated and getting to a reasonable level of herd immunity. How do we open up safe travel corridors? Europe is doing the same thing. Those discussions are ongoing we're trying to get those discussions going with the U.S. They are obviously, already starting to have those discussions with China. And so, I don't you know -- that will take some time, I think you will start to see some bilateral agreements or multilateral agreements in the second half of this year. I think we're at a stage right now, where we're --- everybody's still focused on vaccination to get their herd immunity. But with the overwhelming amount of supply of vaccines, which aren't all distributed perfectly around the world, or even around our country at this point, but the numbers are becoming overwhelming, the surplus is there going to be calm as we get into this summer, my sense is overwhelming. And we're going to be able to have a shifting of those resources around the world to the markets most in need, as we get into June, July, August, September and into the latter part of the year, that is going to allow for a reasonably, hopefully a reasonable trajectory in terms of, some of the some of these economies getting to a better place. China is obviously already in a reasonably good place. So, as the U.S. sort of, has a few more months in Europe, I think the real opportunities to start opening travel quarters. I do think it'll happen that way, just based on the discussions I'm having with multiple administrations than our teams are having, I don't think it's going to be like, one day the world's open, you know, like, Yay, everybody. I think it's going to be agreements between like, the U.S. in the U.K., the EU and China, the U.S. and China that will allow for those quarters to open up, you know, make sure that there's flight capacity that the regime for vaccination testing and all that is sort of is bolted down. So that's a long answer, because it needs to be as complicated, I think in the second half of the year. My hope is and belief is that you're going to start to see some of those corridors open up. We're pushing everybody really hard. But in the meantime, I think we're fine. Just because if a corridor is not open, as I said, people are restrained and leaving their country or their territory, and they're going to start traveling when they feel safe. And you're going to keep all that pent up demand in your local market.\nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist.\nPatrick Scholes: One of the issues of the moment at the property level is with staffing and wages. I'm wondering your thoughts on this? Do you see that as a temporary issue that hotels can get by the summer without having to raise wages to attract employees? Or do you see wage inflation inevitable to meet the staffing challenges? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, it's a difficult issue, as I'm sure if you're talking to the ownership community you're hearing and listen, we talk to him every day and we operate a lot of properties. It is singularly at the moment, I wouldn't say the only issue when you're in a global pandemic, there's lots of issues, but it's one of the most important issues because, it is very difficult, particularly here in the U.S. to get labor and it is constraining recovery on a certain times, because you can't get enough people to service the properties. I do think in the short-term, I've already said it, and it's implied in earlier questions, there's going to be wage pressure, wage inflation, I do think it will stabilize and work itself out as we get later into the year, it's a complex issue, That is at the intersection of people being concerned about their health still, particularly in some of the communities that we need to get focused, back in coming back to work and that's going to take some time, both vaccination and marketing to a number of those communities to get vaccinated and getting it done and getting them to a place where they feel safe being in a workplace. So that's part of it. And then, the other part of it is, getting kids back in school, because a lot of people in the workforce are taking care of kids, they don't there's no daycare, school becomes daycare, and the federal government's it for all the right reasons, the way back when did a top up of unemployment insurance and on top of the state unemployment insurance and obviously sent out $14 100 checks and they did all these things to support people that were in arm's way, all of all of which made sense. At the time, maybe some of it makes a little bit less sense now, in the sense that the demand is there, and the jobs are there. Yet people don't have as much of a need to come back to it. So, but that in theory, on September, whatever, six, the Federal top up, expires, I guess it could be extended my impression, it will not be -- my hope is it will not be not because I don't care about the people, I think there's just enough jobs. We literally, I think 3 million of our Hilton but industry folks do a lot of work. I think by the time you get to September, October, I think the vast majority of those could easily be reemployed given what I think demand will be in the business. And that's for everybody, right best for the country. It's best for the individual, team members, but it's that the convergence of all of that. So I think it's going to tough. I haven't been talking to a ton tomorrow, I think it'll be tough between now and September. I think when we, by the time you get to September, mass vaccination will hopefully be behind us, kids will be back in school. And people will feel safe, that it's safe to go back. And they want to get back in be earning a paycheck. And so, I think it will then stabilize as we get into the latter part of the year.\nPatrick Scholes: Thank you, Chris for your complex and evolving\u2026\nChris Nassetta: Trust me, we're spending a lot, there's no silver bullet in the short-term. We've spent a lot of time on it. I think this is one of those, you just have to sort of -- you just have to work through it. It will work out because all of those things are going to be changing. And so the conditions are going to change pretty materially, as we get to the fall, but between here and there, it's going to be incremental, because then I think it'll be a sea change in the fall.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Chad, thank you and to everybody that joined us today, we appreciate the time, as always, it's hard to say we're really pleased with where things are given what we've been through over this last year and that we're still in the middle or towards hopefully the end of a pandemic. But we are pleased, I've always had confidence in the business model of ours. I've always had confidence in people's desire to travel; for all the reasons they have always wanted to travel. I think the evidence is pretty clear one that -- the decisions that we made as a result of the crisis have made our business stronger. We're driving higher market shares, higher margins, on a lower cost structure and that as we see, the telltale signs of getting past the health crisis. We're starting to see the world come back to life and all the reasons I thought people wanted to travel are, I think playing out, the way in and we had hope for we have a ways to go. So I don't want to be a power Pollyanna about it, but we feel good about where we are and definitely incrementally better than we did over the last couple quarters. So thanks again. And we'll look forward to reporting back after we finish our second quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter system-wide RevPAR declined 38.4% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis as rising COVID cases and reinstated travel restrictions and lockdowns disrupted the demand environment, especially across Europe and Asia Pacific. However, occupancy improved sequentially throughout the quarter, increasing more than 20 points. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million in the first quarter down 45% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management franchise fees decreased 34% less than RevPAR decreased as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better than expected license fees and development fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenged demand environment, reinstated lock downs and travel restrictions in Europe and Japan coupled with temporary hotel closures and fixed operating costs including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties weighed on our performance. Continued cost control mitigated segment losses. For the quarter diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.02. Yes, that's a good question. I think those trends are not changing dramatically in the short term, right? They sort of stay, we've got a pretty good development pipeline, both in full service and limited service, you have seen growth, I mean, primarily through our master limited partnerships in China with Hampton and Home2. But also, as we deploy Hilton Garden Inn and other brands around the world, you are seeing slightly faster growth in limited service. So for it to change the overall trajectory of fees per room, it will take a really long time. And so that has been pretty steady, as has the mix between full service and limited service generally speaking in both the pipeline of rooms under construction, I think it's about 60:40, full service limited service. And that stayed pretty constant. All the other way, sorry, 40:60. Yes, I think, look, the second part maybe is a little more straightforward. Our overall view on capital allocation hasn't changed. Obviously, we've suspended dividend and buyback to preserve liquidity during the pandemic, but the way we think about it broadly hasn't changed. And I think the way we think about it, more specifically on the first part of your question is, we want to get a little further into the recovery, a little bit further into reliably generating free cash -- positive free cash flow and having our leverage levels start to come down. And so that, unless something crazy happens, we think that happens over the course of the year, we'll talk to our board about it sort of in the second half of the year as the recovery takes shape. And we'd say it's highly likely that starting next year, we get back into the capital return business. Yes, it's a difficult issue, as I'm sure if you're talking to the ownership community you're hearing and listen, we talk to him every day and we operate a lot of properties. It is singularly at the moment, I wouldn't say the only issue when you're in a global pandemic, there's lots of issues, but it's one of the most important issues because, it is very difficult, particularly here in the U.S. to get labor and it is constraining recovery on a certain times, because you can't get enough people to service the properties.

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. It has been a little over a year since the pandemic started. Over that time, we acted swiftly to address the challenges we face so we could quickly turn our focus to best positioning ourselves towards recovery and beyond. I'm really proud of how we've set up the company for the future. And most importantly, I'm grateful to our team members who have continued to lead with hospitality and to all of our stakeholders for their ongoing support. In the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR decreased 38% year-over-year and 53% versus 2019. Rising COVID cases and tightening travel restrictions particularly across Europe and Asia Pacific weighed on demand through January and most of February, March marked a turning point as we lapped the start of the U.S. lockdowns RevPAR turned positive of more than 23% year-over-year. System-wide occupancy reached 55% by the end of the month, driven by strong leisure demand. As expected recovery in group and corporate transit continued to lag but both segments showed sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter. Overall, this positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. While recovery varies by region and country, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Boy, that's a lot of questions all embedded into one. But that is probably the most important; I'll cover parts of it. Maybe Kevin will throw some things in. And we'll save a little bit maybe for later, because I'm sure there is a lot of similar questions, but thank you. And I do think that is the question, obviously as both Kevin and I covered Carlo, we saw, pretty marked improvement, as we march through the quarter. And that continued into April. In terms of the global data, I think the best way to look at it is against, a 19 comparison, because looking at it against, 2020, particularly right now, as you were in the early stages of the pandemic is relatively useless. And so, if you look at January and February, you were globally and the U.S. was similar, if you look at it, you were sort of in the 55% to 60%, down from a RevPAR power point of view. And you picked up about 10 points, going down into the -- sort of the mid 40s down in March. And then, in April, you had another step up and into the low 40s. Obviously, made a little early to say but I would say that trajectory in our mind continues if we look at forward bookings both. On the leisure transient side, which is what's going to dominate the second quarter, it feels like we're going to continue marching on. If you look at it by segments, which I you know, obviously, it's been a lot of time and this will sort of get to some of our views on the business transient and the group side. If you look at it, you break down room nights by segments relative to 2019. Again, I'm focusing on room nights to sort of take rate for the moment out of it. Leisure in the first quarter was already close to 90% of 19. By the way, for what it's worth, much lower based on lower rated business, but just again, room nights. And business was about 50% in the first quarter, again, lower if you look at it, on a RevPAR basis. And group was about 35 to 40. As you march through, our expectations for the year, our belief is globally and every region will be a little bit different. And I'll save a regional question for somebody else, because I don't want to do too much of a filibuster on one question. But if you march through, the year, my expectation is, you're going to have an incredibly robust, leisure driven summer. So we're going to continue to see good progress. We believe the summer will be meaningfully over 2019 peak levels of leisure demand as we get into the fall and every day, you're reading the same things I'm reading, but I'm also as I'm sure you are talking to a lot of CEOs of large companies that we deal with or that are friends of mine. And I think, clearly, as you get into the summer, many people are starting to bring folks back in the office, certainly, as you get into the fall, all things, sort of being equal in terms of trajectory, vaccination, most businesses are going to be bringing folks back maybe not fully, probably not fully, but on some flexible basis. But a whole lot different than what we've been experiencing. We do believe that and we do see it both in China, as I said in my prepared comments, we do see it in parts of the United States, where restrictions have been lifted earlier, I mentioned in my prepared comments, business travel volumes already 75% of what they were in '19 in those markets. So I think it is -- even though not fully through it not fully open anywhere, I think it is really good evidence that as people get back to work as kids in the fall, go back-to-school, which at this point, I think is very highly likely you are going to see a step change into the third and fourth quarter in business transients. I also see it in our booking pace on the group side that you will see a pretty good step change in the group side, I gave you some stats, so I won't repeat them. At the moment, it is more Smurf kind of related business and small meetings in the second half of this year with the bigger meetings, really some happening but really those getting booked more into next year at a high volume. But we do believe that that we will have a lot of realized group business a lot more of it than we've been experiencing in the second half of the year. So if you sort of jumped to the fourth quarter, recognizing Q2 is going to be largely leisure, Q3 is going to sort of be a transition on a room night basis. Our forecasting, which is all it is, but it's based on a lot of data. And then based on sort of the current trajectory that we're on, we think room nights and leisure will be at 19 levels. We don't think rates will be back to 19 levels. So sort of RevPAR levels in the leisure sort of in the low 80s sort of percent. We think business transient and by the time you get to the fourth quarter based on what we're seeing in markets that are recovering on a room night basis will be about 70%-ish. I'm being reasonably precise, obviously, but these are sort of our sense of estimate. And obviously, lower than that on a RevPAR basis, because we're still not going to have the all the highest rated business travel back. That's why it takes time to sort of get back to 19 levels. And we think group from a volume point of view could be halfway back to 19 levels. Again, it won't be the highest rated groups, those will start coming next year when we get to a place where we have the larger groups, association, etc, that are typically are paying. So that's sort of -- that's how we think the year is going to play out. We think that, as a result, RevPAR levels every sort of month as we go versus 19 are going to get better. By the time we end the year, I think we could be back somewhere around 70% or something-ish of 19 levels on a run rate basis, which isn't all the way home, but is a heck of a lot, better than where we were and what I would say not to be pollyannaish about it, what I would say is, the recovery of late, certainly since we had our last call the recovery, the slope of the recovery has been steeper than what we would have thought in all regards. Now, a lot of it has to come on the business trends, that we're seeing some as I described, not like we have none. And we're seeing a pretty decent up tick. But that is sort of a fall expectation. But I would say broadly, as you can probably tell from my comments, there's a bunch of data to support it, we think the slope of the recovery has steepened since the last time we talked. And thus, our reason for optimism, the things are on a good path. You asked about fee generation that will follow and I don't think there's a whole lot more to say that, as the business recovers, so go our fees, that's how we get paid. And I do think sort of built into my expectations that I gave us sort of my view and our view of pent up demand. I think there's a huge amount of pent up demand. And my guess is every single person that you guys talk to whether they run a business, whether you talk to him, they're a friend of yours, you see him on the beach, or wherever you are, that they're talking about needing to and wanting to get out both for leisure but increasingly needing to and wanting to get out for business and to congregate in groups. There are a lot of important work to get done in these group settings that I think after a while people realize that that is not possible to keep going without it. So I do think there's a -- I think we're on a real -- on a very good slope, we need the vaccination trends and the infection rates and all of the fun stuff that we're all looking at, every minute of every day, because that's all the media is covering, obviously, we need all that to progress. But our view is, we're on a very solid road to recovery. Did I get most of what you wanted? I let a few nuggets for somebody else to ask about. Yes, I mean, of course, it's a concern. I mean, we haven't sort of inflation going on, not just in the input costs, but labor as well. So when they ultimately -- when people need to operate, open and operate, the costs are higher. Now we've done a bunch of things and are doing a bunch of things to bring costs down inside the hotels by creating really good efficiencies that I think will more than offset that component of it. But costs to build are going up and financing is not particularly readily available for the best owners it is and people are starting new build projects in the U.S. and around the world. But, I suspect and sort of built in, Shawn, to our expectations on the unit growth is that the U.S., you will see a cycle where particularly in the U.S., the new construction numbers are going to be much, much lower, that's obviously long-term healthy for the industry. But the good news for us is the world is a big place and the pressures are not the same in all places in the world, particularly recognizing that the place where we get the second biggest chunk of our growth is Asia Pacific and China in particular. And those, those pressures are very different in the sense that they're less and there's a lot more financing available, etc, etc. And so, not unlike coming out of the Great Recession, our job is to be really resilient. This is the benefit of an investment in a big global company. I think we're really good at this and sort of anticipating and adapting to the trends. And like, after the Great Recession, the same thing happened in the U.S., there wasn't so much an inflationary so there was just a dearth of capital and new construction starts went way down, that's what's happening here, that'll be healthy for the industry and what did we do, we pivoted then the same way. We're pivoting now, just with more tools in the toolkit, meaning conversions become a much larger part of what we're doing. And we are much further along in terms of the relationships we have around the world, in the areas of the world that are continuing, to not only motor along, but pick up steam. I mean, I think China is an example, in our second biggest market, we're going to sign more, start more and open more deals, than I think we ever have this year, right. And so, diversification is a powerful thing. Ultimately, I do believe the pressures on the cost to build will abate over a period of time and I don't think it'll be that long a period of time, I'm highly confident that the financing markets will -- have been easing up and will continue to ease up and the U.S. in terms of new development, or new construction starts will be a huge engine of opportunity for us, as it always has been and pick up a lot of steam. And I'm sure other things around the world will happen over time where they slow down. But, we're very quick on our feet, not to pat us on the back too much. But I think we've been able for 15 years to continue to drive really good growth. While lots of crazy things are going on around the world, because there are different conditions and there's ways to continue to grow. And so, while we do starting -- finishing with where I started, we do worry about it. I think we have a plan to address it. I think we've built that into the expectations that we've provided to you guys in terms of where we think growth will be. Yes. That's a great question. Actually, Thomas, thanks for asking. It is one that we were debating over the last few days ourselves. And there are varying opinions on it even in inside our own shop. I mean, I've been saying 23 or 24, as you know, on these calls publicly and I still believe that I think with the slope of the recovery I'd probably be on the earlier end of that, rather than the later, as we have a little bit more visibility. I think there is a chance from a room night point of view, certainly on a run rate basis that we get back next year. But I think to get both room nights and rate and the compression we need requires certainly in the U.S. that broadly requires the bigger groups to be back. And while I think they're coming back and certainly they want to be back, the planning and all of that, say it's on a lag. So I think that takes some time next year. So I still say 23, 24, but I'd probably hear towards the earlier end of that. It's another reason I think it takes time to get back to 19 levels, sort of picking up my earlier answer is because I do think, not only people cut budgets, not everybody, was Amazon or whatever and that has really benefited during this time a lot. Most businesses by number have been really negatively impacted by the pandemic and they need to cut expenses. And so I'm highly confident, as is the case with any cyclical downturn and recovery, when this happens that those budgets will build back, but it will take some time. Now, I think in the second half of this year, I think, number one, there's a huge amount of pent up demand. And by definition, they only have half a year to spend whatever they have anyway, because nobody's going to doing a ton of traveling in the first half of the year. So I think, ironically, I think there's plenty of budget capacity, I look at our own budget, there's plenty of budget capacity, when you talk to businesses for the rest of this year. I think as you go into next year, if we're in a full scale recovery, while people are going to, for a period of time, want to be thrifty. I think in the end, it'll just be what the opportunity set is. And if we're in a robust recovery, what I have seen again, I can't prove it, but I've seen it in every other cycle as you get into that, the rope gets, businesses let the rope through their hands, because they have to, they have to deliver alpha, they have to compete against other businesses that are trying to do the same thing. And so, their people have to get out on the road, they have to have meetings, they have to build their culture, innovate, collaborate, get out, get their sales forces out and do all the things they do. So, the steeper the slope of the recovery, like in every other cyclical recovery and that's when we get through the pandemic, we're done largely with the health, then you're in a cyclical economic recovery, the steeper the slope, the faster it comes back. That's just the way it's always worked. I don't think it'll be any different here. But that's why I said 23, 24. I, again, I said probably I'd take the earlier of that the rather than the later given the current slope of what we're seeing. But that's why it takes longer, we will get back to room nights, I think faster, because we'll still find room nights that are lower rated business, because we've gotten really good at that. But we're going to want to shift the mix out over the next couple of years to the higher rated business, get more compression from groups to ultimately get back there. So I think budgets will normalize, sort of between now and 2023, if the slope of the recovery is what we think, is what we're seeing. It's a complicated answer, I think when you boil it down, I don't think there is going to be any material shift. I do believe, obviously, short to intermediate term, there's a shift because like everybody, not all of our owners, but most of our owners are dealing with a very difficult situation, I would say that 99.9% now, some of them are much further along in recovery, because their portfolios are in markets that have had rapid recovery resort market, southern U.S., and they're doing pretty well. But broadly, the owner community, obviously, has been hurting, as have we, as have the whole industry, there's not -- it's not like, it's been easy on any of us. We obviously have deployed a whole host of things to be supportive of the owner community and those are still fully deployed, in the sense of working very hard with a lot of folks on behalf of the industry for government support in the right areas and we don't -- we have not stopped those efforts. And I do believe as we get to a real recovery there's opportunities to get help with real stimulus to get people moving again. And so we continue to work, day and night, on those efforts as things evolve. And obviously, we've done, a whole bunch of work in the short-term to provide massive amounts of relief from standards across the board, so that owners could -- make manage their way, we could all manage our way to the other side, I've mentioned it in passing. But it's worth mentioning, again, we call it our hotel, the future work, we were looking in a very granular way across every one of our brands. We're not done with the work but we were done with a lot of the work to figure out when we get to the other side, how do we deliver the incredible experience for the customer that continues to drive the premiums that we've had, by the way, which is the highest levels in our history at this moment. But also do it in a way that's more cost efficient for our ownership community. I'm highly confident, as I said, even with the labor pressures that we are going to experience here in the U.S. particularly, that when it's all said and done, we're going to be able to drive higher margins. So on a like-for-like basis, if you believe which I do, that, when you get out a couple years, you're going to have similar demand levels to '18 or '19 even with the cost pressures, we believe that we have that we have engineered a way to be able to drive even greater returns. So our owners, while it's difficult, now when we get the other side, both their existing assets and their opportunity set for doing a new development, we think are going to be better than what we had pre-pandemic, because we think we were just doing a better -- we're going to do we are and will continue to do a better job. And so that's a long winded way of getting to the answer, which I gave you at the beginning. So as a result of that, I don't think they'll be a meaningful difference. I mean, with some owners, there may be but I would say, in the main I don't think so, I think the owner community, that we deal with which is an immensely diversified community, we have 10,000 owners around the world that we deal with, the vast majority of them, this is their business. This is what they do, own and operate on a franchise basis. And it's all they do. It's not the case across all 10,000 owners, but the bulk of our system, this is what people do. And I don't think if we can deliver for them, the premiums we've delivered, which have only gone up and do it in a way where they can get more of the bottom-line, that they're going to abandon their business model. I think they're don't want to carry on. But it takes some time, right, this being pragmatic, because this has been really difficult, and which is why we've worked so hard to sort of help create the bridges both and what we could do, what the government could do to get them the other side. And why I said in, honestly, in my earlier comments, particularly in the U.S. where why I think the new development side and all of these pressures and just the pressures of owners, broadly is going to mean, it's going to take a little time for the new construction side of development to pick up what it was pre-pandemic, but that will happen in my opinion. And I think the relationship will be much more similar than different to what it was. And as I said before, in the meantime, it's a big world and we've pivoted and we're doing some really cool things around the world to make sure that we continue to enhance our network effect and deliver more hotels and more fees. Having said that, in the next -- starting in the second half of the year and into the next couple of years, this will accelerate our overall growth, just because, sadly, the ownership segment given a lot of the fixed rent nature of it and where it's been, which has been concentrated in U.K., Europe and Japan, which have been impacted, dramatically, more impacted. If you look at the RevPAR numbers in those markets and in the segment are twice as bad in the first quarter as the overall. As you get those markets open, you're going to take those numbers, which have been terrible, will become a significant contributor to growth. Yes, sure, Robin, good questions. I think, look, in the first part, I think we've said, several times publicly that we think over the next several years, it'll be between 4% and 5%. And, sort of the range there is meant to capture sort of all of the things we've been talking about, right, the timing of openings, the timing of conversions, the timing of removals, the trajectory that we're seeing in new construction. So we still think 4% to 5%, it'll be within that range for the next few years. And then, the second half on conversions, yes, we do you think conversions will pick up over time. In the last cycle, it got to something in the 40% range of overall deliveries probably doesn't get and we've think we've said this publicly as well, probably doesn't get back to that level. This cycle just because the denominator likely won't contract that dramatically, but we do think conversions will continue to be bigger contributor, it'll be a little bit lumpy a lot of them are larger hotels, some of the things we're working on now or bigger deals either portfolio deals or larger individual hotels that sort of require a transaction to happen for the conversion to happen. So I don't know if that happens later this year or next year, but it definitely will pick up over time. Yes, I mean, we've been having a lot of discussion within the industry. And within China, in fact, I participated in a meeting with the Premier Li of China, just a couple of weeks ago and this is one of the topics that we talked about. If you look at our business, using some metrics, in our business, like in the U.S., international, inbound, only about 4% of the business, if you look at our business globally, it's about 10%. And it does weigh, obviously, more heavily inbound business in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe, which depends on it more. So would be higher than 10%, a large feeder market is China, I mean, its other parts of the world as well, but it's China. And so I think as Europe opens up, obviously, they're going to be like the rest of the world, I think they're going to be doing, within region travel, which given all the pent up demand, as actually I think been reasonably good, just like we're seeing in the U.S., even though we don't have much inbound travel going on, we don't have any outbound going on. And so I think, in the end Europe's opportunity for the early stages of recovery are robust for the same reason, while they're not going to have inbound from China, or other markets, they're not going to have any outbound and Europeans like to travel and particularly in the summer, like to go on vacations and when it's open and they can, they will and they'll stay within the confines of either their countries or the region. So I think I think it's going to be fine. Obviously, longer term, as you get some more stabilized world, you want to open up these travel quarters, I had a meeting with the White House last week, maybe the week before they said with Premier Li of China, the week before that. And we were talking about a lot of topics, but that was a primary topic both was the Chinese administration and the U.S. administration on trying to figure out how do we figure out as the world is getting vaccinated and it's a little uneven, but as certain countries are getting heavily vaccinated and getting to a reasonable level of herd immunity. How do we open up safe travel corridors? Europe is doing the same thing. Those discussions are ongoing we're trying to get those discussions going with the U.S. They are obviously, already starting to have those discussions with China. And so, I don't you know -- that will take some time, I think you will start to see some bilateral agreements or multilateral agreements in the second half of this year. I think we're at a stage right now, where we're --- everybody's still focused on vaccination to get their herd immunity. But with the overwhelming amount of supply of vaccines, which aren't all distributed perfectly around the world, or even around our country at this point, but the numbers are becoming overwhelming, the surplus is there going to be calm as we get into this summer, my sense is overwhelming. And we're going to be able to have a shifting of those resources around the world to the markets most in need, as we get into June, July, August, September and into the latter part of the year, that is going to allow for a reasonably, hopefully a reasonable trajectory in terms of, some of the some of these economies getting to a better place. China is obviously already in a reasonably good place. So, as the U.S. sort of, has a few more months in Europe, I think the real opportunities to start opening travel quarters. I do think it'll happen that way, just based on the discussions I'm having with multiple administrations than our teams are having, I don't think it's going to be like, one day the world's open, you know, like, Yay, everybody. I think it's going to be agreements between like, the U.S. in the U.K., the EU and China, the U.S. and China that will allow for those quarters to open up, you know, make sure that there's flight capacity that the regime for vaccination testing and all that is sort of is bolted down. So that's a long answer, because it needs to be as complicated, I think in the second half of the year. My hope is and belief is that you're going to start to see some of those corridors open up. We're pushing everybody really hard. But in the meantime, I think we're fine. Just because if a corridor is not open, as I said, people are restrained and leaving their country or their territory, and they're going to start traveling when they feel safe. And you're going to keep all that pent up demand in your local market. Trust me, we're spending a lot, there's no silver bullet in the short-term. We've spent a lot of time on it. I think this is one of those, you just have to sort of -- you just have to work through it. It will work out because all of those things are going to be changing. And so the conditions are going to change pretty materially, as we get to the fall, but between here and there, it's going to be incremental, because then I think it'll be a sea change in the fall. Chad, thank you and to everybody that joined us today, we appreciate the time, as always, it's hard to say we're really pleased with where things are given what we've been through over this last year and that we're still in the middle or towards hopefully the end of a pandemic. But we are pleased, I've always had confidence in the business model of ours. I've always had confidence in people's desire to travel; for all the reasons they have always wanted to travel. I think the evidence is pretty clear one that -- the decisions that we made as a result of the crisis have made our business stronger. We're driving higher market shares, higher margins, on a lower cost structure and that as we see, the telltale signs of getting past the health crisis. We're starting to see the world come back to life and all the reasons I thought people wanted to travel are, I think playing out, the way in and we had hope for we have a ways to go. So I don't want to be a power Pollyanna about it, but we feel good about where we are and definitely incrementally better than we did over the last couple quarters. So thanks again. And we'll look forward to reporting back after we finish our second quarter."

Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their results, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We\u2019re happy to report a strong end of another year of continued growth. Together with our team members, owners and communities, we\u2019ve navigated through the most challenging times our industry has experienced and are deep into recovery throughout the world. During the year, we continued investing in new innovations and partnerships that meet guests\u2019 evolving needs and further strengthen our value proposition for Hilton Honors members and owners. We remain committed to delivering reliable and friendly experiences to our guests and we continue to enhance our network through our strategic and disciplined approach to development, enabling us to serve even more guests across more destinations for any stay occasion they may have. Our strategy drove strong performance for the year with system-wide RevPAR up 42.5% versus 2021 and approximately 1% shy of 2019 levels. Both adjusted EBITDA and EPS surpassed our expectations and prior peaks with margins of roughly 69%, up more than 300 basis points year-over-year and more than 800 basis points over 2019 levels. Strong results and higher margins enabled us to generate the highest levels of free cash flow in our history and returned more than $1.7 billion to shareholders for the full year. Turning to results for the quarter. System-wide RevPAR grew 24.8% year-over-year and increased 7.5% compared to 2019 with performance improving sequentially versus the third quarter. We saw continued progression across all segments with leisure, business transient and group RevPAR all exceeding 2019 levels. System-wide occupancy reached 67%, up from the third quarter and just 3 points shy of prior peak levels. Overall rates remained robust, increasing 13% versus 2019 with all segments exceeding expectations. As expected, leisure trends remained strong throughout the quarter, with RevPAR surpassing 2019 levels by approximately 12%, modestly ahead of third quarter performance. Strong leisure transient demand continued to drive rates up in the high-teens compared to 2019. Business transient RevPAR also continued to improve, with business travel up 3% versus 2019, nearly all industries saw continued recovery compared to the prior quarter. Small and medium-sized businesses remained an important and growing part of our business travel segment, accounting for roughly 85% of our segment mix and enhancing our overall resiliency. Group saw the biggest quarter-over-quarter improvement with RevPAR fully recovering to 2019 levels, driven by both occupancy and ADR gains. Company meetings boosted performance improving more than 7 points versus the third quarter. As we look to the year ahead, acknowledging macroeconomic uncertainty we expect system-wide top line growth of 4% to 8% versus 2022. We expect performance to be driven by continued growth in all segments and aided by easy first quarter comps due to Omicron, meaningful recovery across Asia and solid growth in U.S. urban markets as group business continues to recover. Comprising roughly 20% of our normalized mix, group is a segment with the greatest visibility. For 2023, group position is up 25% year-over-year and nearly back to 2019 levels. Even with robust forward bookings, the pipeline still remains strong with tentative bookings up more than 20% versus last year, helped by rising demand for company meetings as organizations bring their teams back together. Additionally, pricing for new bookings is up in the low double digits and lead volumes in January were at all-time highs. Turning to the development side. We continue to deliver on our commitment to capital-light growth. For the full year, we added nearly a hotel a day, totaling more than 58,000 rooms and celebrated the opening of our 7,000th hotel. Since our go-private transaction 15 years ago, we\u2019ve more than doubled the size of our system. Our rooms in the U.S. are up nearly 100%, and our international portfolio is now 3.5 times larger. Additionally, we\u2019ve added 10 new brands to our system, more than doubling our portfolio of brands. We achieved all of this without any acquisitions and more than 90% of the deals in our current pipeline did not have any key money or other financial support. In the fourth quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 60,000th Home2 Suites room, our 150,000th DoubleTree room, our 200th hotel in CALA and 600th hotel in Asia Pacific, including our first Hilton Garden Inn in Japan. We also saw continued strength in construction starts throughout the year, leading to starts of more than 70,000 rooms for the full year. In the U.S., starts increased more than 9% versus 2021. We now have more rooms under construction than all major competitors. With a record pipeline of more than 416,000 rooms, half of which are under construction, we expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5% for the year and remain confident in our ability to return to 6% to 7% net unit growth over the next couple of years. Our disciplined development strategy continues to enhance our network effect and enables us to serve more guests across more destinations for any stay occasion. Building on this commitment, last month, we launched our newest brand, Spark by Hilton, a value-driven product that delivers our signature reliable and friendly service at an accessible price. Spark provides a simple, consistent and comfortable stay with practical amenities and unexpected touches, filling an open space in the industry by creating a new premium economy lodging option to meet the needs of even more guests and owners. Premium economy represents a large and growing segment of travelers, totaling nearly 70 million annually in the U.S. alone, for which, we have not had a tailored brand to serve. This cost-effective all conversion brand offers a streamlined reinvestment plan, focused on core guest elements and enables owners to leverage our industry-leading commercial engines and powerful network effect. To date, we have more than 200 deals in various stages of negotiation, almost all of which are conversions from third parties. Additionally, we\u2019ve identified more than 100 U.S. markets with no Hilton-branded products, providing a great opportunity for the brand and the Company to expand its presence. As a testament to the strength of our system and our continued success of our customer-focused strategy, Hilton Honors surpassed 150 million members during the fourth quarter and remains the fastest-growing hotel loyalty program. Honors members accounted for approximately 64% of occupancy in the quarter, up more than 300 basis points year-over-year and roughly in line with 2019. Additionally, we welcomed approximately 200 million guests to our properties during the year, exceeding pre-pandemic peak levels. We remain focused on ensuring Hilton has a positive impact on the communities we serve. For the sixth consecutive year, we were included on both the World and North America Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, the most prestigious ranking for corporate sustainability performance. And for the seventh consecutive year, we were ranked among the World\u2019s Best Places to Work by Fortune and Great Place to Work. As our performance demonstrates, our team members have proven that we can handle whatever comes our way. And because of our hard work and discipline, we are incredibly well positioned for the future. We\u2019re at a pivotal moment with great opportunities ahead and a new golden age of travel. And we\u2019re more confident than ever that our team is poised to deliver in 2023 and beyond. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to give a little bit more detail on the quarter and the expectations for the full year.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 24.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis and increased 7.5% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength in leisure as well as steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Strength over the holiday travel season also benefited results. Adjusted EBITDA was $740 million in the fourth quarter, up 45% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth, particularly in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, as well as roughly $30 million in COVID-related government subsidies, which benefited our ownership portfolio. Recovery in Japan following borders reopening in October also contributed to strong performance in ownership. Management and franchise fees grew 31% year-over-year, driven by continued RevPAR improvement. Good cost discipline further benefited results. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.59, increasing 121% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance. Fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 20% year-over-year and increased 8% versus 2019. All three segments showed quarter-over-quarter improvement as compared to \u201819, with performance continuing to be led by strong leisure demand. Both business transient and group RevPAR recovered to above 2019 peak levels for the first time since the pandemic began, driven by continued recovery in occupancy and strong rate. In the Americas outside of the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR increased 53% year-over-year and 25% versus 2019. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand over the holiday travel season, particularly at resort properties where RevPAR was up over 60% versus peak levels. In Europe, RevPAR grew 67% year-over-year and 20% versus 2019. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, particularly from the U.S. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 26% year-over-year and 34% versus 2019. The region benefited from international inbound travel during the World Cup in Qatar. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR was up 29% year-over-year and down 19% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 37% compared to 2019, taking a step back quarter-over-quarter as loosening travel restrictions led to a surge of new COVID cases. Demand is expected to gradually recover throughout the year, but remains volatile in the near term due to rising infections. The rest of the Asia Pacific region saw significant improvement with RevPAR, excluding China, up 8% versus 2019. Performance was largely driven by strength in Japan following borders reopening. Turning to development. For the full year, we grew net units 4.7%, modestly lower than expected, largely due to the ongoing COVID environment in China, which weighed on fourth quarter openings. Conversions accounted for 24% of our gross openings for the year. And additionally, our pipeline grew year-over-year, ending 2022 at more than 416,000 rooms, with nearly 60% of those located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. Looking to the year ahead, despite the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, we are encouraged by the robust demand for Hilton-branded products in both the U.S. and international markets. For full year 2023, we expect net unit growth of between 5% and 5.5%. Turning to the balance sheet. In January, we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity under the facility to $2 billion and extend the maturity to 2028. As we look ahead, we continue to remain confident in the strength of our liquidity position and financial flexibility. Moving to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 23% and 27% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $590 million and $610 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.08 and $1.14. For full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth between 4% and 8%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $5.42 and $5.68. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $123 million in dividends for the year. For full year 2022, we returned more than $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In the first quarter, our Board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you, and thanks for all the color you provided. Kevin or Chris, whoever wants to kind of tackle it, obviously, given the strength in the first quarter and acknowledging there\u2019s seasonality and it doesn\u2019t flow this simply, it does look like, at least for the back half of the year, you guys are looking at a flattening out. Could you kind of -- RevPAR, could you more or less frame kind of how you\u2019re thinking about the back half from a macro perspective? And what\u2019s more or less embedded in your guidance as it relates to the economy?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, listen, you can see in the fourth quarter -- first of all, thanks for the question. I think that is the $64,000 question on everybody\u2019s mind. I mean, you could see in the fourth quarter, we had really good strength across all the segments. We\u2019re early in the year. But in the first quarter, we continue to see that that strength continue in substance relative to 2019, obviously, versus 2022, it\u2019s way up because of the Omicron impact. But we continue, from a fundamentals of the industry point of view, to feel very good about things. I mean, if the fundamentals are supply and demand, that\u2019s what ultimately drives the result. The supply side is quite muted. We\u2019re currently experiencing -- using the U.S. market, which is our biggest market, as an example, equal to the lowest levels of supply that we\u2019ve seen. Thankfully, we get more than our fair share. But overall in the market, very low levels of supply. And that continues to be met with very strong demand. And we have not seen, for the record, any weakening. We have not -- we haven\u2019t like seen any telltale signs. There are no threats of like any of our major segments sort of backing up. What I think is driving that is some of those cyclical and secular sort of tailwinds. First, you continue to see consumers shifting how they\u2019re spending their money. So, maybe they\u2019re spending a little bit less, but how they\u2019re spending it, it continues to be shifted more towards experiences where sort of exhibit A on the experience side. The international markets are opening up. People -- you\u2019re starting to see not just inbound to the U.S. but across the world, people traveling. Asia Pacific is opening up pretty fully. It will take a little bit more time. We saw that happen in Japan in the fourth quarter, which raged. We had strong results. So, we get the full benefit of that. China is obviously going through sort of what we went through 12 to 18 months ago with herd immunity and the like. But our view is that\u2019s happening quite rapidly. On the ground, you\u2019re already starting to see significant travel within China in terms of uptick. And we expect, particularly in the second half of the year, you\u2019re going to have a big tailwind from that. And there continues to be broader pent-up demand across all segments. I mean, you could argue in the leisure side, some of that has -- the people have been doing a lot of it, but we don\u2019t see them slowing down. So, we continue to think people partly because of the shift in -- as I mentioned, towards experiences, we continue to see strength there. On the business transient side, still good demand, very strong demand and growing demand, lots of pent-up demand. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we finished the second half of last year on the group side as people really got comfortable, we were through COVID and they could start planning events. They\u2019ve been planning them like crazy. Even the biggest groups, all the association stuff, that really starts to hit the second half of this year because of all of the planning. Some of that\u2019s happening. I\u2019ve been in a lot of big events, speaking at them lately. But the group demand, which I think is pretty resilient, just because people have gone years without doing things that they need to do for survival, is pretty resilient. So, those are -- the economics of supply and demand are really good. To be specific, Carlo, and a very fair question, when we\u2019ve given you a range of 4% to 8%, what did we sort of build into it? I mean, part of the reason that you\u2019re suggesting a flattening or decel because, let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s math. I mean, we\u2019re going to be way up. You saw our guidance for the first quarter. The world was partly shut down in the first quarter last year. So, that\u2019s just a comparability issue. But we have anticipated, right or wrong, we\u2019ve tried to be conservative that the second half of the year, you\u2019ll see macro economic conditions slow. So, if you were to categorize it, I would describe it as we have assumed in the second half of the year sort of a plateauing related to what we think will be a moderate recessionary environment in the second half of this year. And that\u2019s what we have sort of built into what we\u2019ve suggested to you in the numbers today.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great, Chris. Thanks. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just one follow-up. As you guys think about \u201823 and obviously, some projects that likely were slated for the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, kind of slipping into \u201823. As it pertains to conversion activity as a percentage of the unit growth this year, would you think that that 24% is better, or would you think it\u2019s higher or lower than that 24% that you experienced in \u201822?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Carl, we think it\u2019s going to be higher. I mean a couple of different reasons. One, conversions continue to be more important as the world gets a little bit tougher, although those conditionings are loosening. It has been tougher for new construction, as you know. So conversions become even more important. And then, Spark, as we\u2019ve talked about in our prepared remarks, is a 100% conversion brand. So, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a ton of those introduced this year. But by the end of the year, we\u2019ll start delivering those. And so that will drive a little bit higher level of conversion. So, the way we think about it, we don\u2019t guide specifically, but higher than that 24%, say, probably 30% or higher for the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: So, I just wanted to see, Chris, if you could talk about what\u2019s embedded in the second half of this year\u2019s guidance with respect to U.S. occupancy and pricing changes on a year-over-year basis?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, I\u2019m not going to get highly specific because we gave you a range and it would be hard to do the range that way. But I would say, directionally, the way to think about it is that occupancy sort of flattens out. We don\u2019t believe -- and at least in the numbers we\u2019re giving you, we don\u2019t anticipate that occupancy even gets back to 2019 levels. RevPAR levels, we think, throughout the year will be higher because of rate integrity. For all the reasons I described in my filibuster off of Carlo\u2019s question, we do continue to believe we will have good pricing power, at least through this year, simply because there is no capacity addition really coming into the market. But in U.S. -- the question about the U.S. market, and we do have these both cyclical and secular tailwinds that are giving us increases in demand that we think are going to allow us to continue to have pricing power. We\u2019re not -- assuming in the second half of the year that pricing power is increasing, I would say, we assume it\u2019s flattening or maybe even modestly lower to get to the ranges in numbers that we\u2019ve suggested to you. So, on the occupancy side, if the world is better than everybody thinks, there may be some opportunities. Again, we -- at a very high level, we\u2019ve assumed not a crash landing, sort of soft to bumpy landing in the U.S. with a moderate recessionary environment in the second half. But with some structural things that are going to help the business globally that I talked about and help the business in the U.S. in terms of spending patterns, group demand and pent-up demand on certain categories of business travel.\nJoe Greff: Great. And just as my follow-up, Chris or Kevin, when you think about the fees not related to RevPAR growth in the franchise and the licensing line, specifically the credit fees as well as royalty fees coming from timeshare, do you think that grows in line with RevPAR, or how are you thinking about how that changes over the course of this year versus last year?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Joe, I think, look, historically -- or not historically, over the last few years, it\u2019s been less volatile, right? So, if RevPAR was up 45%ish for the year this year, those fees were up something less than that, although still very robustly. And HGV is public, so you can look at what they\u2019ve grown when they report. I think in a more normalized RevPAR environment of 4% to 8%, they should grow slightly high -- they should grow at a rate that\u2019s better than the overall business. And so largely dependent on spend, although our credit card program set a record for spend in the fourth quarter and for the full year, would spend about 50% higher than it was even in 2019. So, that program is doing quite well, although it should be -- it should grow better than RevPAR over time, but it will be a little bit less volatile than it\u2019s been just given what\u2019s been going on in the world.\nOperator: The next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Chris or Kevin, just maybe we could talk about the development side. I mean, obviously, the kind of shifts from China side, the overall outlook on the construction starts remains robust, and we just continue to get a lot of investor concern about the ability of developers to finance new projects. How has that changed with the interest rate environment or the economy? So, how did your conversations go kind of throughout the quarter? And then, if you could talk, maybe dig -- as my follow-up, dig a little bit deeper into Spark. There\u2019s been a bit of concern or question in the past about kind of going further down in the chain scales and just hoping you could unpack that a little bit for us. Why is right now the opportunity set right for moving into the premium economy space?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Sure, Shaun. Thanks. I\u2019ll start with sort of maybe the construction trends more broadly and then maybe hand it off to Chris to cover Spark a little bit. I think what you\u2019ve seen -- look, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes, right? So, you\u2019re talking about the interest rate environment and availability of capital. And obviously, rates are a lot higher than they had been. And availability of capital is a little bit more constrained, but there\u2019s still plenty of money available for the right projects in the world. If you think about what\u2019s going on at the local and regional bank level is different than what\u2019s going on at the money center banks in terms of capital constraints and things like that. You have some headwinds as we would say in terms of construction costs coming down. They\u2019re still higher than they were in 2019 by about 20% to 30%, but that\u2019s off of peaks and moving in the right direction. And then, as we\u2019ve been talking about the fundamental environment gives people more confidence that when the hotel -- when they develop the hotel and it opens, it will perform at a higher level than maybe it otherwise would have. So, their pro forma goes up. So, you sort of put all that into gonculator, and that\u2019s why starts started to build in the U.S. and ended up higher in the U.S. last year than they were the year before. It depends on where you are in the world. Obviously, it was really difficult -- not only was it difficult to get hotels open/impossible in China at the end of the year because, literally, the offices that gave you your certificate of occupancy were closed. And so, that\u2019s why you saw a little bit of softness in our NUG. That same environment is going on in starts. So, if you\u2019re in China, starts have been behind. But we think starts are going to continue to build from here. The fundamental setup does give developers optimism. And the way they\u2019re thinking about it, they can absorb, not in all cases but in a lot of cases, they can absorb a higher cost of their construction loan and thinking that the world will be in a better place when they open the hotel, it will perform better and that when they roll their construction loan into a permanent loan, then hopefully, the rate environment will be a little bit more normalized. So, those are sort of some of the puts and takes of what\u2019s going on in the world.\nChris Nassetta: Yes, supporting that, and I\u2019ll talk about Spark. When we talk to our owners, I would say at this point, the majority of our system are making more money. Each individual hotels are making more money than they were at the peak of 2019. So, that\u2019s driving optimism. And the reason they\u2019re making money is more efficiencies, higher margins, obviously, rate integrity and pricing power has helped that. But they\u2019ve got -- the bulk of the portfolio is producing more free cash flow than it ever has, and this is the business they\u2019re in. And many of them are quite good at finding the money in a local and regional context as they have decades-long relationships. And as Kevin said, that\u2019s why you saw in the second half of the year, we saw an inflection point where starts started to go up here in the U.S. and generally around the world. And we think that trend -- we don\u2019t see anything that suggests that trend is reversing itself. On Spark, listen, we spent a lot of time. We -- the truth is we have been thinking about something in this space for a long, long time, almost the entire time I\u2019ve been at the Company. We had a lot -- obviously, we\u2019ve doubled the size of our brand portfolio. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been sitting around doing nothing. We had not entered that zone. But three years ago or so, we started to look at it and say, like, because it\u2019s a very big customer base, it\u2019s a huge opportunity to better serve our existing customers, but also an important opportunity to acquire new customers, if you look at that customer base, at least half, probably, I think, arguably more than half of that customer base or customers that are early in their travel lives that are going to grow up and do other things. And the sooner you get them into the system and building loyalty with them, the better off you are. So, as always, when we look at brands, it starts with a sort of a customer acquisition and a network -- continuing to build the network effect for our existing customer base. So, we were confident when we started looking at it three years ago that there was a lot of reasons to be serious about it. Then comes the hard part of trying to figure out how do we engineer something at this price point that really works, that it works for customers, meaning that the experience they have with us is going to be great, friendly, reliable, consistent and that we can apply the same magic, if you will, from a commercial point of view to our ownership community that we have in our other brands so that we drive superior performance to our competition. And so, there\u2019s a reason we spent three years on it because it\u2019s not easy, but we think we figured it out. I would say, and time will tell, this will be the most disruptive thing we\u2019ve done in terms of brand space because it is very ripe for disruption. If you go look at hotels at this price point in this segment, you will find a very high beta situation in terms of the physical attributes. And it\u2019s very hard to fix when you have a big system that\u2019s already out there. So, you\u2019d say, well, this is all conversion. It is all conversion. But what we did over the last few years is figure out with our supply management team, with our design teams, with our brand teams and everybody else in this company, how can we engineer a product where every single hotel, 100% of the time when it comes in the system has been refreshed, everything that is customer-facing. We built it, we built the rooms, we put it in real hotels, we built the lobbies. And we brought customers in to say, is this what you want? Is it different? And so, what will be different about this in this space and why I am not worried about it and why, frankly, I\u2019m -- I mean it\u2019s not sexy, okay? It\u2019s not as sexy as lifestyle luxury. But in terms of an opportunity to be a value contributor in the billions of dollars for this company and its shareholders, I\u2019m as excited about this as anything else we\u2019ve done because from a customer point of view, we are going to give them a high-quality, consistent experience at this price point that does not exist in the market because of the way we\u2019ve engineered the retrofit of these properties. And this will ultimately take some time, but it can happen quickly. It will be thousands -- it\u2019s the biggest segment in the U.S. It\u2019s the biggest segment in Europe. I mean, it will be thousands -- it should be, over time, the biggest brand we have in terms of number of units. And as I said, most importantly, it always starts with what is best for better serving our existing customers and acquiring new customers. And how do we do it in a way that owners will get a superior return. We think we have cracked the code. We will have to prove it. It will come to life quite quickly. As Kevin said, we will have Sparks open this year, won\u2019t have a too terribly big impact on this year\u2019s numbers. But as we get into next year and beyond, we think it will have a meaningful impact. And as I said, ultimately, I look at these as opportunities as a consumer branded company to think about a new product at our scale, being able to be deployed at scale, deployed globally and have the opportunity to be worth billions of dollars to our shareholders. And I think this is -- checks all of those boxes. So, we\u2019re super excited. We\u2019re not nervous. We\u2019ve done all the work. I hope we\u2019ve proven at this point, given this is the tenth or 11th brand that we\u2019ve created out of the ashes or out of the dust that we\u2019re pretty good at this at this point.\nOperator: The next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you a little bit on the owned and leased portfolio. I think you mentioned $30 million of COVID-related subsidies, I think, during the quarter. And I was just wondering, should we just assume that those start to kind of dissipate as we go through 2023, or are they just all gone at this point, or how are you thinking about that?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I think it\u2019s played through based on the programs that have been approved thus far in Europe. I mean, if -- there\u2019s maybe a little bit more to come through based on things we\u2019ve for that haven\u2019t quite come yet, through a very small amount. And who knows, if anything more will come, but we\u2019re not expecting any. And the thing I would say is if you look at it on a normalized basis, because remember, we had subsidies in 2021 as well, if you sort of pull all that out, the growth has been quite dramatic. And we continue to think that that portfolio will grow at a higher rate than the overall business this year.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Thank you. And then, Chris, I\u2019m just wondering if you could just touch on -- you mentioned the U.S. pipeline, and we all see what\u2019s happening there. Any change in the way that Hilton is thinking about using key money in order to maintain or grow share or potentially lend to developers at this point, or...?\nChris Nassetta: No, no. As I commented on in my prepared remarks, and if you look at the whole pipeline, more than 90% of it has no key money, no financial support. We have not changed our view on that. If you look at the aggregate dollars in CapEx, and you peeled out what we\u2019re spending in key money, actually, if you average last year and this year together because we had some things we thought would happen last year that are happening this year, it\u2019s actually lower than what we\u2019ve been suggesting to everybody over the last couple of quarters. So no, I don\u2019t -- we still view the opportunity to grow as very strong and without the use of our balance sheet and that ultimately is driven by what you would guess it is. Everybody investing in our portfolio of brands is doing it to get a return, and our brands are the highest performing brands in individual segments. But overall, when you aggregate them together, and people are continuing to want to invest with us in that way. So, a long-winded way of saying, no, we don\u2019t see anything. In fact, I think the trend line for us overall in key money, I\u2019m looking at Kevin, he runs development, too, so make sure he agrees with this. But the trend line is down, meaning over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve had a little bit of elevated key money in aggregate dollars because during COVID, a bunch of things we\u2019ve been working on a long time came together or some other people\u2019s deals blew up, and we were able to sweep in on some very strategic things at a moment in time. And those were lumpy, but we always have opportunities we\u2019re working on. But I think those lumpy -- there are going to be fewer of those lumpy things. So, I think -- honestly, I think in an aggregate dollar sense over the next few years, the trend line is down, not up.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Just following on some of the earlier discussions about the thoughtful conservatism baked into the guidance. Could we talk about the capital returns a bit and just how you thought about pulling that together? And is that necessarily a kind of firm number in view of how the guidance is set up? And what could push that up or down going forward?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. David, I have to say that, yes, it\u2019s a firm number. We wouldn\u2019t have given it to you. I assume that goes without saying, but I can\u2019t help myself. So yes, as of now, it\u2019s a firm number. That\u2019s what we think. It\u2019s a range for a reason. There\u2019s a lot of year left and a lot could happen. I think if -- I did read your note this morning, so I think I know where you\u2019re going with this. Right now, we\u2019re a little bit lower than our historic range of leverage. That range does assume effectively no borrowing for the year because we think that the borrowing -- and we don\u2019t like the borrowing environment right now. It\u2019s very choppy. Rates are higher than we used to. And so, that assumes that leverage stays roughly flat to slightly down for the year. And that\u2019s what -- and yes, that\u2019s what the range of guidance and EBITDA will spit out for capital return, again, recognizing that we\u2019re a very high free cash flow business. And we don\u2019t do -- other than what we were just talking about with a little bit of key money and a little bit of capital, we don\u2019t do much else with the money other than pay a small dividend and use it for buybacks. And so, that\u2019s the range for now.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. The only thing I would add -- all of that I agree wholeheartedly. The only thing I would add to that is that\u2019s not -- our longer-range views on the balance sheet and return of capital haven\u2019t changed. We have been very consistent since the beginning of time. It feels like saying we want to be 3 to 3.5 times. We\u2019re at the low end or below -- a little bit below the low end of the range for the reasons Kevin just described. We think debt markets are choppy. They\u2019ll get better. Over the intermediate and longer term, we don\u2019t intend to run leverage at those levels. We would intend to be in the ranges, frankly, and that\u2019s -- we\u2019ve said it on these calls, probably towards the high end of the range, in a more normalized environment or even beyond that is something that we would certainly -- we\u2019ve been asked and said many times publicly, we would consider. We just need -- we\u2019re just looking for a little bit more stability in the debt markets. And obviously, as Kevin said, we don\u2019t have the need. And as I commented in my answer to the earlier question on key money, which is the primary use in terms of CapEx, we don\u2019t think we need a whole lot more. So, any borrowing, any re-leveraging or leveraging up, obviously, this affords us the opportunity to return even more capital. So, I think there will -- those opportunities will exist. We gave you what we think right now, and we\u2019ll see how the debt markets and broadly how the macro sort of shifts going forward.\nDavid Katz: I appreciate that. And everything is well received since I misspoken my question. I know -- mean what we say. Can we talk about the new brand just a bit? Am I taking away from the notion that you are fitting yourself into a space where there aren\u2019t necessarily direct competitors, or there are and you believe you\u2019ve come up with a better value proposition that will just compete?\nChris Nassetta: I would say we don\u2019t think there are any real competitors. I mean, meaning that, if we do our job, we\u2019re going to sort of come in plus or minus 20% below true, which would still probably be above, if you look on average, it will be above where most of the folks in the existing segment are. That\u2019s why, like we like to do, we\u2019re a branding company. We\u2019ve made up a segment. We called it premium economy. So, our view would be it is above the traditional economy space. It will price above, both because of the strength of our system, our commercial engines, loyalty system and all those things, but importantly, because it will be a better, higher quality, more consistent product.\nOperator: The next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: My question and follow-up are both really sort of clarifications on earlier comment. Chris, you said in your guidance, you were assuming that pricing power would flatten or even be modestly lower later in the year. I just wanted to clarify, were you saying pricing power like the rate of increase modestly lower or actually some rate actually lower? Just to clarify.\nChris Nassetta: Not rates actually lowered. Just basically, plateauing relative to \u201819 in the second half of the year.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then on occupancy, you mentioned that your guidance, you\u2019re really not even getting back to occupancy in 2019. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s just sort of a matter of time and that you would expect to be there by 2024, or are you -- do you have a view about\u2026\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean -- honestly, I think it may be a bit of conservatism on our part. I do think we get -- by the way, Robin, we can get back there tomorrow if we wanted. But we could jump rates because we could occupy ourselves up. But we don\u2019t want to do that. We actually manage, as you can see with the rate growth, we are trying to manage in this cycle, particularly given the environment, inflation and everything else, really effectively to drive the best bottom line results for our owners, in this case, that to a degree, our occupancy levels are driven by pricing strategies. Okay? Some of it is still -- I think there is more recovery and more pent-up demand, particularly business travel and the group segment. So, I absolutely believe there\u2019s never been a cycle that I\u2019m aware of that in recorded history where we will not go above prior occupancy level, so I think that we will. It may happen this year. Honestly, if we continue to have pricing power, I kind of hope it doesn\u2019t. And I hope it happens next year that we continue to be able to drive rate and thus higher margins and more profitability for our ownership community.\nRobin Farley: Great. And then just my other clarification on your net unit guidance. From the comment in the release, I guess, I kind of understood the sort of the coming in just under 5% of the COVID delays in China that it was maybe some openings that were sort of pushed past December 31 in China that would maybe make then Q1 opening sort of ahead of the full year number. But then in your comments, you made a comment about starts in China being behind. So I guess, I just wanted to get some clarification on whether it was just openings delayed by a few weeks or sort of a broader issue with the unit growth in China if starts are also behind?\nKevin Jacobs: I think it\u2019s both, Robin. I mean, the environment is creating a drag both -- created a drag in the fourth quarter on openings and also has created a drag on starts because it\u2019s just broadly when they reopen and then -- before it was lockdown, now it\u2019s they reopen and everybody gets sick, but the net result is the business activity comes -- is a drag on business activity. So signing starts and opens were all affected by it. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long-term trend in China. We think it\u2019s timing. And yes, by definition, if we -- as I said earlier in the Q&A, if there was an environment where you literally have a completed hotel that can\u2019t open because it can\u2019t get a significant of occupancy, we don\u2019t give you quarterly guidance. So, we\u2019re not going to get into like when those hotels are going to open. But I think you can assume they\u2019re going to open on a delay.\nOperator: The next question is from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: I guess, if I stare long enough at your release, I find one negative number, which is pricing is down year-on-year for the Waldorf Astoria. Is there any particular pricing pressure at high-end hotels you\u2019re seeing, or is that mix? And maybe more broadly on pricing, I guess what I observed is, you seem to have taken a little bit less pricing than some of your peers and your occupancies recovered a little bit quicker. Would that match what the strategy has been? And does that give you maybe a few more buttons to compress on pricing further through the recovery?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. First of all on Waldorf, there\u2019s no -- that\u2019s driven by individual hotels. Just the Waldorf brand, unlike our other brands, there\u2019s not so many hotels that one dynamic in one particular market or two markets will drive it. So, there\u2019s no -- we\u2019re not broadly seeing slowdown in luxury. To the contrary, we\u2019re continuing to see -- we\u2019re continuing to see great strength. I\u2019ll dish the second part of that to K.J.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Rich, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t -- maybe a little bit of clarification on the second part. I\u2019m not fully understanding where you were going with that. I\u2019m sorry.\nRichard Clarke: Sure. I guess, when I look at your pricing relative to the market, relative to some of your closest peers, it seems you\u2019ve increased prices a little bit less than some peers and your occupancies recovered quicker than some peers. Is that in line with your sort of strategy?\nKevin Jacobs: No. Our market share is up across the board, right? So, we\u2019re driving better revenue outcomes than our competitors. You may be looking at individual. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at in terms of our competitors or individual sort of spot rates for year-on-year. We\u2019d be happy to\u2026\nChris Nassetta: The simplest way to look -- system-wide last year, we finished in share at the highest levels in our history, and we gained share both in rate and occupancy. So -- but those numbers across the system would not support that theory.\nRichard Clarke: Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up. The reasonable size adjustment in the net other expenses from managed and franchise, the pass-through costs that have been negative through the rest of the year. Looking like maybe you\u2019re clawing back some of the losses through COVID. So, just wondering if there\u2019s some specific program that\u2019s pivoted that the other way in Q4?\nKevin Jacobs: No. There\u2019s always timing issues in terms of those line items. In the end, we have revenue and all of our various funds and programs are going to run breakeven over time, and then you\u2019re just seeing timing issues on the P&L.\nOperator: The next question is from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: I wanted to ask about the tight labor market that we continue to hear about in terms of the -- from the Fed\u2019s reporting. Obviously, very strong in the experiential category on travel and lodging. So, do you believe this has peaked when you talk to your partners, kind of your builders? What are they saying just in terms of the labor market? And then secondarily, how does that factor into how you\u2019re thinking about IMFs and kind of profits in the back half of the year if it hasn\u2019t? Thanks.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, the labor market situation has eased a lot. So as we talk to -- I mean, listen, we employ a lot of people. We operate a lot of hotels because I talk to our team, but beyond that, talk to our franchise community. I think they would say that broadly, we are not fully back to where we were in terms of access to labor, but we\u2019re getting awfully close. And so, if it was on a scale of 1 to 10 a year ago a 10 in terms of extremis, it\u2019s a 4 or 5. I mean, it was something we were talking about every single day, every conversation, and it is not quite as topical, which is the good indication. So, I think the labor situation is easing. You continue to see across a broad universe of other industries, notwithstanding what the Fed is saying, a lot of layoffs, including, of course, through technology, but through banking, also through retail, where people had really staffed up thinking that the COVID retail demand was going to be maintained and it hasn\u2019t. And so, there are a lot of people that are getting pushed back out into the job market, and that\u2019s allowing -- affording us the opportunity to get the labor that we need. You\u2019ve also seen, while wage rates went up a lot during COVID, net-net from \u201819 to now, you\u2019ve seen that start to stabilize. And those kind of big increases are not continuing. They\u2019re at a higher absolute level, but the level -- the rate of increase has diminished substantially. In terms of how we think about IMF, we feel good about IMF. I think for the year, we expect IMF to add significantly to the growth rate. We think this year we expect that it will get over our prior high watermark of \u201819.\nChad Beynon: Great. And then secondly, just in terms of FX, the dollar has weakened a little bit against kind of the basket of the non-U.S. currencies. How are you thinking about an operational impact from that? And then also, as that kind of feeds into guidance, is there a translational impact with just a slightly weaker dollar versus what you saw in \u201822?\nKevin Jacobs: Operationally, obviously, it has effects in each individual market where your pricing labor in those currencies. It\u2019s a very small headwind single-digit millions of dollars headwind in this year\u2019s numbers.\nOperator: The next question is from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBill Crow: You talked about the strength of leisure in the fourth quarter and all of last year. But when you think about leisure demand this year, how would your RevPAR 4% to 8% growth for the year, how would that -- would leisure be in that range, or there\u2019s a lot of concern that it\u2019s going to be significantly below that?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I think we do think it would be within that range. We continue to see strength. We do expect like all the segments that you will see some plateauing as a result of a slower macro environment in the second half of the year. But we still feel very good about it. The demand trends here and now are really strong. And while there\u2019s a lot of noise out there, if you go back -- just went back and looked at the number, consumers still have incremental savings in the U.S. relative to the month before COVID of $1.5 trillion. Now -- so that peaked at like $2.7 trillion. It\u2019s down to $1.5 trillion. So, they are spending it, and they\u2019re probably reading the papers and watching the news and getting more nervous. And so, that would be a behavior set that would say that maybe they pull back a little bit. But the reality is we\u2019re not seeing it. And I think part of the reason we\u2019re not seeing it, okay, and time will tell, is because of the phenomena that I described earlier in the call, which is they\u2019re shifting their spending. So not only do they still have incremental savings in their pockets and feel reasonably good, but they\u2019re spending a lot more of it at bars and restaurants and travel as a percentage of their overall spend. And so, we have anticipated, like all segments, there\u2019ll be a little bit of a headwind in the second half of the year, but we do expect leisure to be in those ranges.\nBill Crow: If I could address my follow-up question on Spark, which is really an intriguing product. Does it kind of take care of two problems that are out there for the industry? And one is obviously a lot of deferred CapEx over the last several years. But the other one is the age of select service hotels Hampton and what started in \u201884 or \u201885. So, we\u2019re dealing with hotels coming up on 40 years old. So, is there a -- is that part of the thought process is that you\u2019ve got a lot of hotels that could ultimately fit within that brand?\nChris Nassetta: Listen, it is an ancillary benefit on the margin, meaning if we do have older Hamptons like other third-party products that we think aren\u2019t fitting for Hampton, as you know, we\u2019ve been quite disciplined in keeping the Hampton brand, the strongest brand in lodging, in my opinion, by pushing properties out that are past their prime and don\u2019t make sense in the system. There -- I think over the next 10 years, there is some percentage of those that we will certainly look at keeping in the system. I think in the end, Bill, it will be a very small percentage of the overall system. And if I look at the deals that we have in-house right now, 98% of the deals we are processing right now are third-party brands. So, there are a few Hamptons in there. But there\u2019s no other Hilton brands in there, but there are a few Hamptons. But I would say it\u2019s an ancillary benefit on the margin. A lot of those hotels, frankly, over time, are going to exit the system as we\u2019ve been doing for time and eternity.\nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: [Technical Difficulty]\nChris Nassetta: Hey Greg, can you hear us? Your -- we can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. Your connection is super garbled.\nOperator: I apologize. So, we\u2019ll have to move on to our next question. And the next question is from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Thank you.\nBrandt Montour: Actually, just one from me, Chris and Kevin. So, in terms of development and more medium to longer term sort of net unit growth, and your comments were well taken, Chris, on a couple of years. The world seems to have gotten a bit better for you, though, right, since three months ago, right, in terms of the speed at which China is reopening now, the excitement over Spark and then U.S. starts continuing to get a little bit better. So I guess, the question is, do you feel a little bit better about getting back to the 6 to 7 NUG than you did three months ago? And are we potentially even playing for maybe hitting that run rate in late \u201824?\nKevin Jacobs: Look, I think we said what we said for a reason, Brandt, not to be sort of cagey about it, but there\u2019s a lot can go one way or the other in the world. We still feel great about getting back to 6% to 7%. I don\u2019t -- Chris may have a different view. I don\u2019t feel differently today than I did three months ago about that. I think the world is coming our way a little bit. But we don\u2019t expect -- none of these things stay constant, right? I mean, these trends will change, and we always think the world is going to come our way. So, I don\u2019t feel that much better in three months from now.\nChris Nassetta: I\u2019m probably more optimistic by nature than Kevin. That\u2019s our roles. But no, I think we feel -- we felt pretty good about getting back to it a quarter ago. So I agree in the sense we don\u2019t feel differently. And I think we were asked on the last call, what does it look like? And we said it looks like you get this terra firma with a view on the U.S. economy either in recession or -- where people have a little bit more certainty. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve accomplished -- that hasn\u2019t really changed. Then, we said China, okay, that we got to get China back and reopened. And while it\u2019s not fully reopened, it\u2019s happening. So I think on the margin, we feel better about that. And we didn\u2019t have -- we in our heads had Spark, but we didn\u2019t tell you about Spark. And so, we now have Spark there, and I think that provides, no pun intended, a little bit of spark to our progress in getting back there. So, we felt pretty good about it a quarter ago. I think we feel pretty good about it now.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Chad, and thank you all for joining us. As you can imagine -- or I hope you would imagine, we\u2019re pleased with the state of the recovery, fourth quarter numbers are great. While we\u2019re sentient and watching the macro trends, we feel very good about what we\u2019re seeing right now in the business and advanced bookings and all the things that sidelines that we have into the business. We think we\u2019re going to have another really good year. And we appreciate the support. We appreciate the time. We look forward to catching up with everybody after the first quarter to give you more sightlines into what we\u2019re seeing then. So, thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 24.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis and increased 7.5% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength in leisure as well as steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Strength over the holiday travel season also benefited results. Adjusted EBITDA was $740 million in the fourth quarter, up 45% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth, particularly in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, as well as roughly $30 million in COVID-related government subsidies, which benefited our ownership portfolio. Recovery in Japan following borders reopening in October also contributed to strong performance in ownership. Management and franchise fees grew 31% year-over-year, driven by continued RevPAR improvement. Good cost discipline further benefited results. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.59, increasing 121% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance. Fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 20% year-over-year and increased 8% versus 2019. All three segments showed quarter-over-quarter improvement as compared to \u201819, with performance continuing to be led by strong leisure demand. Both business transient and group RevPAR recovered to above 2019 peak levels for the first time since the pandemic began, driven by continued recovery in occupancy and strong rate. In the Americas outside of the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR increased 53% year-over-year and 25% versus 2019. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand over the holiday travel season, particularly at resort properties where RevPAR was up over 60% versus peak levels. In Europe, RevPAR grew 67% year-over-year and 20% versus 2019. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, particularly from the U.S. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 26% year-over-year and 34% versus 2019. The region benefited from international inbound travel during the World Cup in Qatar. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR was up 29% year-over-year and down 19% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 37% compared to 2019, taking a step back quarter-over-quarter as loosening travel restrictions led to a surge of new COVID cases. Demand is expected to gradually recover throughout the year, but remains volatile in the near term due to rising infections. The rest of the Asia Pacific region saw significant improvement with RevPAR, excluding China, up 8% versus 2019. Performance was largely driven by strength in Japan following borders reopening. Turning to development. For the full year, we grew net units 4.7%, modestly lower than expected, largely due to the ongoing COVID environment in China, which weighed on fourth quarter openings. Conversions accounted for 24% of our gross openings for the year. And additionally, our pipeline grew year-over-year, ending 2022 at more than 416,000 rooms, with nearly 60% of those located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. Looking to the year ahead, despite the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, we are encouraged by the robust demand for Hilton-branded products in both the U.S. and international markets. For full year 2023, we expect net unit growth of between 5% and 5.5%. Turning to the balance sheet. In January, we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity under the facility to $2 billion and extend the maturity to 2028. As we look ahead, we continue to remain confident in the strength of our liquidity position and financial flexibility. Moving to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 23% and 27% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $590 million and $610 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.08 and $1.14. For full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth between 4% and 8%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $5.42 and $5.68. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $123 million in dividends for the year. For full year 2022, we returned more than $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In the first quarter, our Board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please? Yes. Carl, we think it's going to be higher. I mean a couple of different reasons. One, conversions continue to be more important as the world gets a little bit tougher, although those conditionings are loosening. It has been tougher for new construction, as you know. So conversions become even more important. And then, Spark, as we've talked about in our prepared remarks, is a 100% conversion brand. So, we don't think there's going to be a ton of those introduced this year. But by the end of the year, we'll start delivering those. And so that will drive a little bit higher level of conversion. So, the way we think about it, we don't guide specifically, but higher than that 24%, say, probably 30% or higher for the year. Yes. Joe, I think, look, historically -- or not historically, over the last few years, it's been less volatile, right? So, if RevPAR was up 45%ish for the year this year, those fees were up something less than that, although still very robustly. And HGV is public, so you can look at what they've grown when they report. I think in a more normalized RevPAR environment of 4% to 8%, they should grow slightly high -- they should grow at a rate that's better than the overall business. And so largely dependent on spend, although our credit card program set a record for spend in the fourth quarter and for the full year, would spend about 50% higher than it was even in 2019. So, that program is doing quite well, although it should be -- it should grow better than RevPAR over time, but it will be a little bit less volatile than it's been just given what's been going on in the world. Yes. Sure, Shaun. Thanks. I'll start with sort of maybe the construction trends more broadly and then maybe hand it off to Chris to cover Spark a little bit. I think what you've seen -- look, there's a lot of puts and takes, right? So, you're talking about the interest rate environment and availability of capital. And obviously, rates are a lot higher than they had been. And availability of capital is a little bit more constrained, but there's still plenty of money available for the right projects in the world. If you think about what's going on at the local and regional bank level is different than what's going on at the money center banks in terms of capital constraints and things like that. You have some headwinds as we would say in terms of construction costs coming down. They're still higher than they were in 2019 by about 20% to 30%, but that's off of peaks and moving in the right direction. And then, as we've been talking about the fundamental environment gives people more confidence that when the hotel -- when they develop the hotel and it opens, it will perform at a higher level than maybe it otherwise would have. So, their pro forma goes up. So, you sort of put all that into gonculator, and that's why starts started to build in the U.S. and ended up higher in the U.S. last year than they were the year before. It depends on where you are in the world. Obviously, it was really difficult -- not only was it difficult to get hotels open/impossible in China at the end of the year because, literally, the offices that gave you your certificate of occupancy were closed. And so, that's why you saw a little bit of softness in our NUG. That same environment is going on in starts. So, if you're in China, starts have been behind. But we think starts are going to continue to build from here. The fundamental setup does give developers optimism. And the way they're thinking about it, they can absorb, not in all cases but in a lot of cases, they can absorb a higher cost of their construction loan and thinking that the world will be in a better place when they open the hotel, it will perform better and that when they roll their construction loan into a permanent loan, then hopefully, the rate environment will be a little bit more normalized. So, those are sort of some of the puts and takes of what's going on in the world. Yes. I think it's played through based on the programs that have been approved thus far in Europe. I mean, if -- there's maybe a little bit more to come through based on things we've for that haven't quite come yet, through a very small amount. And who knows, if anything more will come, but we're not expecting any. And the thing I would say is if you look at it on a normalized basis, because remember, we had subsidies in 2021 as well, if you sort of pull all that out, the growth has been quite dramatic. And we continue to think that that portfolio will grow at a higher rate than the overall business this year. Yes. David, I have to say that, yes, it's a firm number. We wouldn't have given it to you. I assume that goes without saying, but I can't help myself. So yes, as of now, it's a firm number. That's what we think. It's a range for a reason. There's a lot of year left and a lot could happen. I think if -- I did read your note this morning, so I think I know where you're going with this. Right now, we're a little bit lower than our historic range of leverage. That range does assume effectively no borrowing for the year because we think that the borrowing -- and we don't like the borrowing environment right now. It's very choppy. Rates are higher than we used to. And so, that assumes that leverage stays roughly flat to slightly down for the year. And that's what -- and yes, that's what the range of guidance and EBITDA will spit out for capital return, again, recognizing that we're a very high free cash flow business. And we don't do -- other than what we were just talking about with a little bit of key money and a little bit of capital, we don't do much else with the money other than pay a small dividend and use it for buybacks. And so, that's the range for now. I think it's both, Robin. I mean, the environment is creating a drag both -- created a drag in the fourth quarter on openings and also has created a drag on starts because it's just broadly when they reopen and then -- before it was lockdown, now it's they reopen and everybody gets sick, but the net result is the business activity comes -- is a drag on business activity. So signing starts and opens were all affected by it. We don't think it's a long-term trend in China. We think it's timing. And yes, by definition, if we -- as I said earlier in the Q&A, if there was an environment where you literally have a completed hotel that can't open because it can't get a significant of occupancy, we don't give you quarterly guidance. So, we're not going to get into like when those hotels are going to open. But I think you can assume they're going to open on a delay. Yes. Rich, I'm sorry, I didn't -- maybe a little bit of clarification on the second part. I'm not fully understanding where you were going with that. I'm sorry. No. Our market share is up across the board, right? So, we're driving better revenue outcomes than our competitors. You may be looking at individual. I don't know what you're looking at in terms of our competitors or individual sort of spot rates for year-on-year. We'd be happy to... No. There's always timing issues in terms of those line items. In the end, we have revenue and all of our various funds and programs are going to run breakeven over time, and then you're just seeing timing issues on the P&L. Operationally, obviously, it has effects in each individual market where your pricing labor in those currencies. It's a very small headwind single-digit millions of dollars headwind in this year's numbers. Look, I think we said what we said for a reason, Brandt, not to be sort of cagey about it, but there's a lot can go one way or the other in the world. We still feel great about getting back to 6% to 7%. I don't -- Chris may have a different view. I don't feel differently today than I did three months ago about that. I think the world is coming our way a little bit. But we don't expect -- none of these things stay constant, right? I mean, these trends will change, and we always think the world is going to come our way. So, I don't feel that much better in three months from now."

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're happy to report a strong end of another year of continued growth. Together with our team members, owners and communities, we've navigated through the most challenging times our industry has experienced and are deep into recovery throughout the world. During the year, we continued investing in new innovations and partnerships that meet guests' evolving needs and further strengthen our value proposition for Hilton Honors members and owners. We remain committed to delivering reliable and friendly experiences to our guests and we continue to enhance our network through our strategic and disciplined approach to development, enabling us to serve even more guests across more destinations for any stay occasion they may have. Our strategy drove strong performance for the year with system-wide RevPAR up 42.5% versus 2021 and approximately 1% shy of 2019 levels. Both adjusted EBITDA and EPS surpassed our expectations and prior peaks with margins of roughly 69%, up more than 300 basis points year-over-year and more than 800 basis points over 2019 levels. Strong results and higher margins enabled us to generate the highest levels of free cash flow in our history and returned more than $1.7 billion to shareholders for the full year. Turning to results for the quarter. System-wide RevPAR grew 24.8% year-over-year and increased 7.5% compared to 2019 with performance improving sequentially versus the third quarter. We saw continued progression across all segments with leisure, business transient and group RevPAR all exceeding 2019 levels. System-wide occupancy reached 67%, up from the third quarter and just 3 points shy of prior peak levels. Overall rates remained robust, increasing 13% versus 2019 with all segments exceeding expectations. As expected, leisure trends remained strong throughout the quarter, with RevPAR surpassing 2019 levels by approximately 12%, modestly ahead of third quarter performance. Strong leisure transient demand continued to drive rates up in the high-teens compared to 2019. Business transient RevPAR also continued to improve, with business travel up 3% versus 2019, nearly all industries saw continued recovery compared to the prior quarter. Small and medium-sized businesses remained an important and growing part of our business travel segment, accounting for roughly 85% of our segment mix and enhancing our overall resiliency. Group saw the biggest quarter-over-quarter improvement with RevPAR fully recovering to 2019 levels, driven by both occupancy and ADR gains. Company meetings boosted performance improving more than 7 points versus the third quarter. As we look to the year ahead, acknowledging macroeconomic uncertainty we expect system-wide top line growth of 4% to 8% versus 2022. We expect performance to be driven by continued growth in all segments and aided by easy first quarter comps due to Omicron, meaningful recovery across Asia and solid growth in U.S. urban markets as group business continues to recover. Comprising roughly 20% of our normalized mix, group is a segment with the greatest visibility. For 2023, group position is up 25% year-over-year and nearly back to 2019 levels. Even with robust forward bookings, the pipeline still remains strong with tentative bookings up more than 20% versus last year, helped by rising demand for company meetings as organizations bring their teams back together. Additionally, pricing for new bookings is up in the low double digits and lead volumes in January were at all-time highs. Turning to the development side. We continue to deliver on our commitment to capital-light growth. For the full year, we added nearly a hotel a day, totaling more than 58,000 rooms and celebrated the opening of our 7,000th hotel. Since our go-private transaction 15 years ago, we've more than doubled the size of our system. Our rooms in the U.S. are up nearly 100%, and our international portfolio is now 3.5 times larger. Additionally, we've added 10 new brands to our system, more than doubling our portfolio of brands. We achieved all of this without any acquisitions and more than 90% of the deals in our current pipeline did not have any key money or other financial support. In the fourth quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 60,000th Home2 Suites room, our 150,000th DoubleTree room, our 200th hotel in CALA and 600th hotel in Asia Pacific, including our first Hilton Garden Inn in Japan. We also saw continued strength in construction starts throughout the year, leading to starts of more than 70,000 rooms for the full year. In the U.S., starts increased more than 9% versus 2021. We now have more rooms under construction than all major competitors. With a record pipeline of more than 416,000 rooms, half of which are under construction, we expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5% for the year and remain confident in our ability to return to 6% to 7% net unit growth over the next couple of years. Our disciplined development strategy continues to enhance our network effect and enables us to serve more guests across more destinations for any stay occasion. Building on this commitment, last month, we launched our newest brand, Spark by Hilton, a value-driven product that delivers our signature reliable and friendly service at an accessible price. Spark provides a simple, consistent and comfortable stay with practical amenities and unexpected touches, filling an open space in the industry by creating a new premium economy lodging option to meet the needs of even more guests and owners. Premium economy represents a large and growing segment of travelers, totaling nearly 70 million annually in the U.S. alone, for which, we have not had a tailored brand to serve. This cost-effective all conversion brand offers a streamlined reinvestment plan, focused on core guest elements and enables owners to leverage our industry-leading commercial engines and powerful network effect. To date, we have more than 200 deals in various stages of negotiation, almost all of which are conversions from third parties. Additionally, we've identified more than 100 U.S. markets with no Hilton-branded products, providing a great opportunity for the brand and the Company to expand its presence. As a testament to the strength of our system and our continued success of our customer-focused strategy, Hilton Honors surpassed 150 million members during the fourth quarter and remains the fastest-growing hotel loyalty program. Honors members accounted for approximately 64% of occupancy in the quarter, up more than 300 basis points year-over-year and roughly in line with 2019. Additionally, we welcomed approximately 200 million guests to our properties during the year, exceeding pre-pandemic peak levels. We remain focused on ensuring Hilton has a positive impact on the communities we serve. For the sixth consecutive year, we were included on both the World and North America Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, the most prestigious ranking for corporate sustainability performance. And for the seventh consecutive year, we were ranked among the World's Best Places to Work by Fortune and Great Place to Work. As our performance demonstrates, our team members have proven that we can handle whatever comes our way. And because of our hard work and discipline, we are incredibly well positioned for the future. We're at a pivotal moment with great opportunities ahead and a new golden age of travel. And we're more confident than ever that our team is poised to deliver in 2023 and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give a little bit more detail on the quarter and the expectations for the full year. Yes. I mean, listen, you can see in the fourth quarter -- first of all, thanks for the question. I think that is the $64,000 question on everybody's mind. I mean, you could see in the fourth quarter, we had really good strength across all the segments. We're early in the year. But in the first quarter, we continue to see that that strength continue in substance relative to 2019, obviously, versus 2022, it's way up because of the Omicron impact. But we continue, from a fundamentals of the industry point of view, to feel very good about things. I mean, if the fundamentals are supply and demand, that's what ultimately drives the result. The supply side is quite muted. We're currently experiencing -- using the U.S. market, which is our biggest market, as an example, equal to the lowest levels of supply that we've seen. Thankfully, we get more than our fair share. But overall in the market, very low levels of supply. And that continues to be met with very strong demand. And we have not seen, for the record, any weakening. We have not -- we haven't like seen any telltale signs. There are no threats of like any of our major segments sort of backing up. What I think is driving that is some of those cyclical and secular sort of tailwinds. First, you continue to see consumers shifting how they're spending their money. So, maybe they're spending a little bit less, but how they're spending it, it continues to be shifted more towards experiences where sort of exhibit A on the experience side. The international markets are opening up. People -- you're starting to see not just inbound to the U.S. but across the world, people traveling. Asia Pacific is opening up pretty fully. It will take a little bit more time. We saw that happen in Japan in the fourth quarter, which raged. We had strong results. So, we get the full benefit of that. China is obviously going through sort of what we went through 12 to 18 months ago with herd immunity and the like. But our view is that's happening quite rapidly. On the ground, you're already starting to see significant travel within China in terms of uptick. And we expect, particularly in the second half of the year, you're going to have a big tailwind from that. And there continues to be broader pent-up demand across all segments. I mean, you could argue in the leisure side, some of that has -- the people have been doing a lot of it, but we don't see them slowing down. So, we continue to think people partly because of the shift in -- as I mentioned, towards experiences, we continue to see strength there. On the business transient side, still good demand, very strong demand and growing demand, lots of pent-up demand. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we finished the second half of last year on the group side as people really got comfortable, we were through COVID and they could start planning events. They've been planning them like crazy. Even the biggest groups, all the association stuff, that really starts to hit the second half of this year because of all of the planning. Some of that's happening. I've been in a lot of big events, speaking at them lately. But the group demand, which I think is pretty resilient, just because people have gone years without doing things that they need to do for survival, is pretty resilient. So, those are -- the economics of supply and demand are really good. To be specific, Carlo, and a very fair question, when we've given you a range of 4% to 8%, what did we sort of build into it? I mean, part of the reason that you're suggesting a flattening or decel because, let's be honest, it's math. I mean, we're going to be way up. You saw our guidance for the first quarter. The world was partly shut down in the first quarter last year. So, that's just a comparability issue. But we have anticipated, right or wrong, we've tried to be conservative that the second half of the year, you'll see macro economic conditions slow. So, if you were to categorize it, I would describe it as we have assumed in the second half of the year sort of a plateauing related to what we think will be a moderate recessionary environment in the second half of this year. And that's what we have sort of built into what we've suggested to you in the numbers today. Yes. I mean, I'm not going to get highly specific because we gave you a range and it would be hard to do the range that way. But I would say, directionally, the way to think about it is that occupancy sort of flattens out. We don't believe -- and at least in the numbers we're giving you, we don't anticipate that occupancy even gets back to 2019 levels. RevPAR levels, we think, throughout the year will be higher because of rate integrity. For all the reasons I described in my filibuster off of Carlo's question, we do continue to believe we will have good pricing power, at least through this year, simply because there is no capacity addition really coming into the market. But in U.S. -- the question about the U.S. market, and we do have these both cyclical and secular tailwinds that are giving us increases in demand that we think are going to allow us to continue to have pricing power. We're not -- assuming in the second half of the year that pricing power is increasing, I would say, we assume it's flattening or maybe even modestly lower to get to the ranges in numbers that we've suggested to you. So, on the occupancy side, if the world is better than everybody thinks, there may be some opportunities. Again, we -- at a very high level, we've assumed not a crash landing, sort of soft to bumpy landing in the U.S. with a moderate recessionary environment in the second half. But with some structural things that are going to help the business globally that I talked about and help the business in the U.S. in terms of spending patterns, group demand and pent-up demand on certain categories of business travel. Yes, supporting that, and I'll talk about Spark. When we talk to our owners, I would say at this point, the majority of our system are making more money. Each individual hotels are making more money than they were at the peak of 2019. So, that's driving optimism. And the reason they're making money is more efficiencies, higher margins, obviously, rate integrity and pricing power has helped that. But they've got -- the bulk of the portfolio is producing more free cash flow than it ever has, and this is the business they're in. And many of them are quite good at finding the money in a local and regional context as they have decades-long relationships. And as Kevin said, that's why you saw in the second half of the year, we saw an inflection point where starts started to go up here in the U.S. and generally around the world. And we think that trend -- we don't see anything that suggests that trend is reversing itself. On Spark, listen, we spent a lot of time. We -- the truth is we have been thinking about something in this space for a long, long time, almost the entire time I've been at the Company. We had a lot -- obviously, we've doubled the size of our brand portfolio. So it's not like we've been sitting around doing nothing. We had not entered that zone. But three years ago or so, we started to look at it and say, like, because it's a very big customer base, it's a huge opportunity to better serve our existing customers, but also an important opportunity to acquire new customers, if you look at that customer base, at least half, probably, I think, arguably more than half of that customer base or customers that are early in their travel lives that are going to grow up and do other things. And the sooner you get them into the system and building loyalty with them, the better off you are. So, as always, when we look at brands, it starts with a sort of a customer acquisition and a network -- continuing to build the network effect for our existing customer base. So, we were confident when we started looking at it three years ago that there was a lot of reasons to be serious about it. Then comes the hard part of trying to figure out how do we engineer something at this price point that really works, that it works for customers, meaning that the experience they have with us is going to be great, friendly, reliable, consistent and that we can apply the same magic, if you will, from a commercial point of view to our ownership community that we have in our other brands so that we drive superior performance to our competition. And so, there's a reason we spent three years on it because it's not easy, but we think we figured it out. I would say, and time will tell, this will be the most disruptive thing we've done in terms of brand space because it is very ripe for disruption. If you go look at hotels at this price point in this segment, you will find a very high beta situation in terms of the physical attributes. And it's very hard to fix when you have a big system that's already out there. So, you'd say, well, this is all conversion. It is all conversion. But what we did over the last few years is figure out with our supply management team, with our design teams, with our brand teams and everybody else in this company, how can we engineer a product where every single hotel, 100% of the time when it comes in the system has been refreshed, everything that is customer-facing. We built it, we built the rooms, we put it in real hotels, we built the lobbies. And we brought customers in to say, is this what you want? Is it different? And so, what will be different about this in this space and why I am not worried about it and why, frankly, I'm -- I mean it's not sexy, okay? It's not as sexy as lifestyle luxury. But in terms of an opportunity to be a value contributor in the billions of dollars for this company and its shareholders, I'm as excited about this as anything else we've done because from a customer point of view, we are going to give them a high-quality, consistent experience at this price point that does not exist in the market because of the way we've engineered the retrofit of these properties. And this will ultimately take some time, but it can happen quickly. It will be thousands -- it's the biggest segment in the U.S. It's the biggest segment in Europe. I mean, it will be thousands -- it should be, over time, the biggest brand we have in terms of number of units. And as I said, most importantly, it always starts with what is best for better serving our existing customers and acquiring new customers. And how do we do it in a way that owners will get a superior return. We think we have cracked the code. We will have to prove it. It will come to life quite quickly. As Kevin said, we will have Sparks open this year, won't have a too terribly big impact on this year's numbers. But as we get into next year and beyond, we think it will have a meaningful impact. And as I said, ultimately, I look at these as opportunities as a consumer branded company to think about a new product at our scale, being able to be deployed at scale, deployed globally and have the opportunity to be worth billions of dollars to our shareholders. And I think this is -- checks all of those boxes. So, we're super excited. We're not nervous. We've done all the work. I hope we've proven at this point, given this is the tenth or 11th brand that we've created out of the ashes or out of the dust that we're pretty good at this at this point. No, no. As I commented on in my prepared remarks, and if you look at the whole pipeline, more than 90% of it has no key money, no financial support. We have not changed our view on that. If you look at the aggregate dollars in CapEx, and you peeled out what we're spending in key money, actually, if you average last year and this year together because we had some things we thought would happen last year that are happening this year, it's actually lower than what we've been suggesting to everybody over the last couple of quarters. So no, I don't -- we still view the opportunity to grow as very strong and without the use of our balance sheet and that ultimately is driven by what you would guess it is. Everybody investing in our portfolio of brands is doing it to get a return, and our brands are the highest performing brands in individual segments. But overall, when you aggregate them together, and people are continuing to want to invest with us in that way. So, a long-winded way of saying, no, we don't see anything. In fact, I think the trend line for us overall in key money, I'm looking at Kevin, he runs development, too, so make sure he agrees with this. But the trend line is down, meaning over the last couple of years, we've had a little bit of elevated key money in aggregate dollars because during COVID, a bunch of things we've been working on a long time came together or some other people's deals blew up, and we were able to sweep in on some very strategic things at a moment in time. And those were lumpy, but we always have opportunities we're working on. But I think those lumpy -- there are going to be fewer of those lumpy things. So, I think -- honestly, I think in an aggregate dollar sense over the next few years, the trend line is down, not up. Yes. The only thing I would add -- all of that I agree wholeheartedly. The only thing I would add to that is that's not -- our longer-range views on the balance sheet and return of capital haven't changed. We have been very consistent since the beginning of time. It feels like saying we want to be 3 to 3.5 times. We're at the low end or below -- a little bit below the low end of the range for the reasons Kevin just described. We think debt markets are choppy. They'll get better. Over the intermediate and longer term, we don't intend to run leverage at those levels. We would intend to be in the ranges, frankly, and that's -- we've said it on these calls, probably towards the high end of the range, in a more normalized environment or even beyond that is something that we would certainly -- we've been asked and said many times publicly, we would consider. We just need -- we're just looking for a little bit more stability in the debt markets. And obviously, as Kevin said, we don't have the need. And as I commented in my answer to the earlier question on key money, which is the primary use in terms of CapEx, we don't think we need a whole lot more. So, any borrowing, any re-leveraging or leveraging up, obviously, this affords us the opportunity to return even more capital. So, I think there will -- those opportunities will exist. We gave you what we think right now, and we'll see how the debt markets and broadly how the macro sort of shifts going forward. I would say we don't think there are any real competitors. I mean, meaning that, if we do our job, we're going to sort of come in plus or minus 20% below true, which would still probably be above, if you look on average, it will be above where most of the folks in the existing segment are. That's why, like we like to do, we're a branding company. We've made up a segment. We called it premium economy. So, our view would be it is above the traditional economy space. It will price above, both because of the strength of our system, our commercial engines, loyalty system and all those things, but importantly, because it will be a better, higher quality, more consistent product. Not rates actually lowered. Just basically, plateauing relative to \u201819 in the second half of the year. Yes. I mean -- honestly, I think it may be a bit of conservatism on our part. I do think we get -- by the way, Robin, we can get back there tomorrow if we wanted. But we could jump rates because we could occupy ourselves up. But we don't want to do that. We actually manage, as you can see with the rate growth, we are trying to manage in this cycle, particularly given the environment, inflation and everything else, really effectively to drive the best bottom line results for our owners, in this case, that to a degree, our occupancy levels are driven by pricing strategies. Okay? Some of it is still -- I think there is more recovery and more pent-up demand, particularly business travel and the group segment. So, I absolutely believe there's never been a cycle that I'm aware of that in recorded history where we will not go above prior occupancy level, so I think that we will. It may happen this year. Honestly, if we continue to have pricing power, I kind of hope it doesn't. And I hope it happens next year that we continue to be able to drive rate and thus higher margins and more profitability for our ownership community. Yes. First of all on Waldorf, there's no -- that's driven by individual hotels. Just the Waldorf brand, unlike our other brands, there's not so many hotels that one dynamic in one particular market or two markets will drive it. So, there's no -- we're not broadly seeing slowdown in luxury. To the contrary, we're continuing to see -- we're continuing to see great strength. I'll dish the second part of that to K.J. The simplest way to look -- system-wide last year, we finished in share at the highest levels in our history, and we gained share both in rate and occupancy. So -- but those numbers across the system would not support that theory. Yes. I mean, the labor market situation has eased a lot. So as we talk to -- I mean, listen, we employ a lot of people. We operate a lot of hotels because I talk to our team, but beyond that, talk to our franchise community. I think they would say that broadly, we are not fully back to where we were in terms of access to labor, but we're getting awfully close. And so, if it was on a scale of 1 to 10 a year ago a 10 in terms of extremis, it's a 4 or 5. I mean, it was something we were talking about every single day, every conversation, and it is not quite as topical, which is the good indication. So, I think the labor situation is easing. You continue to see across a broad universe of other industries, notwithstanding what the Fed is saying, a lot of layoffs, including, of course, through technology, but through banking, also through retail, where people had really staffed up thinking that the COVID retail demand was going to be maintained and it hasn't. And so, there are a lot of people that are getting pushed back out into the job market, and that's allowing -- affording us the opportunity to get the labor that we need. You've also seen, while wage rates went up a lot during COVID, net-net from \u201819 to now, you've seen that start to stabilize. And those kind of big increases are not continuing. They're at a higher absolute level, but the level -- the rate of increase has diminished substantially. In terms of how we think about IMF, we feel good about IMF. I think for the year, we expect IMF to add significantly to the growth rate. We think this year we expect that it will get over our prior high watermark of \u201819. Yes. I think we do think it would be within that range. We continue to see strength. We do expect like all the segments that you will see some plateauing as a result of a slower macro environment in the second half of the year. But we still feel very good about it. The demand trends here and now are really strong. And while there's a lot of noise out there, if you go back -- just went back and looked at the number, consumers still have incremental savings in the U.S. relative to the month before COVID of $1.5 trillion. Now -- so that peaked at like $2.7 trillion. It's down to $1.5 trillion. So, they are spending it, and they're probably reading the papers and watching the news and getting more nervous. And so, that would be a behavior set that would say that maybe they pull back a little bit. But the reality is we're not seeing it. And I think part of the reason we're not seeing it, okay, and time will tell, is because of the phenomena that I described earlier in the call, which is they're shifting their spending. So not only do they still have incremental savings in their pockets and feel reasonably good, but they're spending a lot more of it at bars and restaurants and travel as a percentage of their overall spend. And so, we have anticipated, like all segments, there'll be a little bit of a headwind in the second half of the year, but we do expect leisure to be in those ranges. Listen, it is an ancillary benefit on the margin, meaning if we do have older Hamptons like other third-party products that we think aren't fitting for Hampton, as you know, we've been quite disciplined in keeping the Hampton brand, the strongest brand in lodging, in my opinion, by pushing properties out that are past their prime and don't make sense in the system. There -- I think over the next 10 years, there is some percentage of those that we will certainly look at keeping in the system. I think in the end, Bill, it will be a very small percentage of the overall system. And if I look at the deals that we have in-house right now, 98% of the deals we are processing right now are third-party brands. So, there are a few Hamptons in there. But there's no other Hilton brands in there, but there are a few Hamptons. But I would say it's an ancillary benefit on the margin. A lot of those hotels, frankly, over time, are going to exit the system as we've been doing for time and eternity. Hey Greg, can you hear us? Your -- we can't understand what you're saying. Your connection is super garbled. I'm probably more optimistic by nature than Kevin. That's our roles. But no, I think we feel -- we felt pretty good about getting back to it a quarter ago. So I agree in the sense we don't feel differently. And I think we were asked on the last call, what does it look like? And we said it looks like you get this terra firma with a view on the U.S. economy either in recession or -- where people have a little bit more certainty. I don't think we've accomplished -- that hasn't really changed. Then, we said China, okay, that we got to get China back and reopened. And while it's not fully reopened, it's happening. So I think on the margin, we feel better about that. And we didn't have -- we in our heads had Spark, but we didn't tell you about Spark. And so, we now have Spark there, and I think that provides, no pun intended, a little bit of spark to our progress in getting back there. So, we felt pretty good about it a quarter ago. I think we feel pretty good about it now. Thank you, Chad, and thank you all for joining us. As you can imagine -- or I hope you would imagine, we're pleased with the state of the recovery, fourth quarter numbers are great. While we're sentient and watching the macro trends, we feel very good about what we're seeing right now in the business and advanced bookings and all the things that sidelines that we have into the business. We think we're going to have another really good year. And we appreciate the support. We appreciate the time. We look forward to catching up with everybody after the first quarter to give you more sightlines into what we're seeing then. So, thank you, and have a great day."

Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our third results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. And with that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The third quarter marked a very important milestone in our continued recovery. For the first time since the pandemic began, system-wide RevPAR surpassed 2019 levels. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance and 2019 levels. We achieved several notable development milestones in the quarter, including reaching 100,000 rooms open across Europe, and announced various strategic partnerships, further enhancing the guest experience and the strength of our global system. The quarter's strong performance, coupled with our capital-light business model, enabled us to continue returning meaningful capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $1.3 billion. And for the full year, we're on track to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders. Turning to the specifics results in the quarter, occupancy reached more than 73%, only four points shy of 2019 levels. As expected, strong travel demand continued through the summer months, primarily driven by robust leisure trends. Post Labor Day, demand remained strong as business transient and group demand improved significantly and leisure demand remained robust. Overall demand for the quarter peaked in September, nearly reaching 2019 levels with business transient demand only two points off 2019 levels. ADR also continued to strengthen and proving quarter-over-quarter and up 11% versus 2019. Rates across all segments surpass 2019 levels, with leisure transient rates up in the high-teens and both business transient and grew up in the mid-single digits. All of this translated into third quarter system-wide RevPAR growth of approximately 30% year-over-year, and 5% compared to 2019 levels, with each month surpassing prior peaks. Leisure transient RevPAR continued to lead the recovery, exceeding 2019 levels by more than 11% for the quarter. Business transient RevPAR reached 2019 levels, with notable acceleration in large corporate business. Our top 20 business accounts are now just 3% shy of 2019 levels, with forward bookings trending above 2019. Small and medium-sized businesses remain ahead of 2019 levels. Group RevPAR reached roughly 93% of prior peak levels for the quarter, with company meetings improving significantly as a percentage of mix. We expect trends to remain strong for the balance of the year with system-wide RevPAR once again surpassing 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Leisure transient RevPAR is expected to remain meaningfully above prior peaks, driven by solid consumer confidence and continued eagerness and ability to travel. We expect business transient RevPAR to continue to see gradual recovery, primarily driven by rising demand as companies encourage their people to get back on the road. System-wide group position for the fourth quarter is approximately 5% above 2019 levels, accelerating over the last several months, largely due to a robust demand pipeline. Additionally, rates on new bookings are up in the mid to high-teens versus 2019, with group mix continuing to normalize. Company meetings and convention business make up a larger percentage of forward bookings versus the same period in 2019. As we look ahead, we remain very optimistic about the future of travel. Despite near-term macro headwinds, we're not seeing any signs that fundamentals are weakening. Rising demand, coupled with historically low industry supply growth, should continue to drive strong pricing power. Consumers are shifting back to spending on experiences, international borders are reopening and pent-up demand is being released across all segments. Consumers still have an estimated $2.4 trillion of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic, or approximately 55% more in their checking and savings accounts than they did in 2019. Additionally, according to a recent global Hilton study, 85% of business travelers hope to travel as much or more next year, and group position for 2023 is less than 10% shy of 2019 peak levels, with a tentative pipeline up significantly. While the macro environment is more challenging, we are in the midst of a strong rebound with secular tailwinds that should support continued growth. Turning to development, we opened 80 properties, totaling nearly 13,000 rooms in the quarter and achieved several important milestones, including reaching 100,000 rooms in Europe, 25,000 Curio rooms globally and 600 Hilton Hotels & Resorts. All of our brands continue growing at a healthy pace given their distinct identities and compelling value propositions for both owners and guests. According to STR, our year-to-date net additions remain higher than all major branded competitors, demonstrating the power of our disciplined development strategy and the strength of our industry-leading RevPAR index premiums. During the quarter, we signed approximately 20,000 rooms, bringing our pipeline to a record 416,000 rooms, half of which are under construction. Signings were boosted by strong RevPAR performance in the US, which drove greater owner optimism around the recovery. While macro factors tempered international signings, we were thrilled to announce nine landmark agreements to expand our luxury presence across seven countries in the Asia Pacific region, including the Conrad, Singapore Orchard. We also signed agreements to grow our flagship Hilton brand in Malaysia, Waldorf and Morocco in what will become our first system-wide tempo property in Times Square. Construction starts outperformed expectations in the quarter, largely due to better activity in the US as the cost of materials stabilized and demand for residential construction declined. According to STR, Hilton is the only major hotel company to deliver year-to-date growth in its under construction pipeline. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of approximately 5%, and we expect mid-single-digit growth for the next couple of years before returning to our historical growth rate of 6% to 7%. With even more exciting destinations to enjoy, we continue strengthening our value proposition for Hilton Honors members. In the quarter, Honors membership grew 19% year-over-year to $146 million, and members accounted for more than 61% of occupancy, up 200 basis points year-over-year and roughly in line with 2019. We also continue to invest in new innovations focused on ensuring we deliver reliable friendly stays that meet guests' evolving needs. An overwhelming 98% of guests in a recent survey said they are prioritizing wellness activities while on the road. During the quarter, we announced an industry-first partnership with Peloton to add Peloton bikes in every fitness center across all of our 5,400 US properties by year-end. Our extremely talented team works tirelessly to execute on a great strategy, and we continue to be recognized for our award winning culture. Hilton was recently named the number one Best Workplace for Women in the US and the number two on the World's Best Workplaces by Fortune and Great Place to Work, our seventh consecutive year on the list and the only hospitality company on the list. As we begin a new golden age of travel, I think we're better positioned than ever. Our brands are performing at their highest levels, we're running our highest margins in our company's history and we're on track to generate our highest levels of free cash flow yet. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you a bit more details on the quarter and our expectations for the full year.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system wide RevPAR grew 29.9% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis and increased 5% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength in leisure demand, as well as steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $732 million in the quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 41% year-over-year. Our performance was driven by better than expected fee growth, particularly across the Americas and Europe. Results also benefited from further recovery in our European ownership portfolio. Management franchise fees grew 33%, driven by continued RevPAR improvement and strong Honors license fees. Good cost control continued to benefit results. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.31, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and increasing 68% year-over-year. Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 22% year-over-year and was up 6% versus 2019. Performance continued to be led by strong leisure demand over the summer travel season, with continued recovery in business transient and group travel further benefiting results. Total US business transient reached 2019 levels for the quarter, with US group RevPAR up 7 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 95% of 2019 peak levels. In the Americas outside the US, third quarter RevPAR increased 74% year-over-year and was up 17% versus 2019. Performance was driven by continued strength in leisure demand, particularly across resort properties where ADR was up more than 20%. In Europe, RevPAR grew 92% year-over-year and was up 20% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong leisure demand and international inbound travel throughout the summer. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 45% year-over-year and was up 6% versus 2019. The region continued to benefit from strong leisure demand and international inbound travel, particularly from Europe. In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR was up 46% year-over-year and down 16% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 14% compared to 2019, improving 33 percentage points quarter-over-quarter as leisure demand picked up over the school holidays and COVID lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing were lifted in July. Travel demand remains volatile in China as a result of strict COVID policies and restrictions to contain new outbreaks. The rest of the Asia Pacific region saw continued improvement with RevPAR, excluding China, up 10 points quarter-over-quarter, with September RevPAR down just 8% to 2019. We remain optimistic about further recovery across the entire Asia Pacific region as travel restrictions continue to ease and borders reopen to international travel. For example, our recent booking pace in Japan has already started to increase following the recent government stimulus announcement and border openings. Turning to development. Our pipeline grew year-over-year and sequentially, totaling nearly 416,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with nearly 60% of pipeline rooms located outside the US and roughly half under construction. For the full year, we still expect net unit growth of approximately 5% and signings of approximately 100,000 rooms globally with US signings exceeding 2019 levels. Despite the near-term macroeconomic challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver net unit growth in the mid-single-digit range for the next couple of years. Moving to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 19% and 23% year-over-year or up 2% to 6% compared to fourth quarter 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $641 million and $671 million and adjusted EPS adjusted for special items -- I'm sorry, diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.15 and $1.23. For full year 2022, we expect RevPAR growth between 40% and 43%. Relative to 2019, we expect RevPAR to be down 1% to 3%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.5 billion and $2.53 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA forecast represents a year-over-year increase of more than 50% at the midpoint and exceeds 2019 adjusted EBITDA by nearly 10%. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $4.46 and $4.54. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $41 million year-to-date. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our third quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, Chris, Kevin, Jill.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Greff: I wanted to talk about corporate negotiated rates. Can you give us some perspective on how important or what percentage of your room nights, pre-pandemic room nights associated with corporate rate negotiations accounted for as a percentage of the total? And then as you think about those negotiations that are ongoing now for next year, do you get the sense that more companies that were traditionally part of the corporate rate negotiations are opting to go to a more dynamic, less contractual rate type of model?\nChris Nassetta: I'll take it in the order you gave it. Just by way of background, you asked where was it in 2019. It was about 10% of our overall business in 2019. At the moment, it's about 7% of our overall business. And that is largely at this point given the big accounts are coming back by choice because we have chosen to pivot our mix as we've been talking about for the last several quarters a little bit more heavily towards SMB, small and medium-sized enterprises, simply because they are higher rated and more resilient through ups and downs. Having said that, our big corporate customers have been customers of ours a long time, and they're important, but we have weighted that down. I think as they I mentioned that we were most recently only really about 3% off with our top 20, my guess is that 7% will go up a bit, but our objective is to keep it a bit lower than 2019. We're early in that negotiation season, and what I can say at this point in talking to our teams is the vast majority of those accounts are going to dynamic pricing. That's something that we've been doing over a very long period of time, even pre-COVID. We did have the majority of the accounts dynamic, but we had a decent chunk, I want to say, 25% or 30% pre-COVID. And through the last few years, we've moved very aggressively to get more people dynamic. So at this point, the majority of them are dynamic. And I think that all customers understand because of what they're dealing with in every aspect of their life, that is that, at least at the moment, inflation is a real thing and that their expectation is that they're going to have to pay more. And the best \u2013 it's early days. The best we think at this point is high single-digit, very low double digit sort of in 9% to 10% range is best we can figure at this moment.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: And the next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Chris, historically, the third quarter is kind of when we get a little bit of a taste of kind of a 2023 RevPAR outlook. And I think knowing all of the macro turmoil that's out there, it makes all the sense in the world to not maybe provide something specific. But can you just help us walk us through your thinking here, big picture? You obviously see a lot speak with a lot of people out there. So based on kind of what you know right now, maybe give us a little bit of directional color. And specifically, what can accelerate further from the trend lines that we're seeing in the third and early fourth quarter? And just how do you see it moving through the year in 2023?\nChris Nassetta: Yeah. I think you're right. There's a lot of macro uncertainty. And as a result, it's a little bit early for us to prognosticate on what we think for next year. Not only that, but we're just at the early stages of our budget process, which we'll be going through over the next 60 days or so, to complete by year-end. And so it is premature. Having said that, directionally, I'm happy to comment on, sort of how we and I think about it at the moment on a forward-looking basis. What we're obviously looking at, as I said in my prepared comments, is fundamentals that are currently pretty strong. And while, again, we're not naive to what's going on with the Fed here in central banks in other parts of the world in the sense of trying to tame inflation by slowing economies, we do think we have a reasonably unique setup that is maybe different than some other industries for a period of time that is going to benefit us not just in the fourth quarter, but into next year. What are those things? Not to be too redundant because I covered them briefly, the laws of economics are alive and well, supply and demand. Supply is at historically low-levels, and it's going to stay there for a while, right, just given everything that's going on from COVID and now into the macro concerns. Demand, is picking up. As I covered relative to the third quarter, our expectation is that it's going to continue to pick up into the fourth quarter. Why is it picking up? It's picking up because the segments remain strong. I mean, leisure, I covered it. People still have desire and a lot of disposable income and savings to spend and more flexibility and time. Business transient that you have a huge amount of pent-up demand that's accrued, as well as in the meetings and events segment, you have the international markets opening up. And you have a broader trend of just the secular shift or maybe cyclical shift back to the more normalized spending patterns of everybody is spending less on things and spending more on experiences. And so, that's what we're benefiting from. We obviously got hammered during COVID, unlike other industries. But now we're in this recovery. And those -- I sort of describe it here with our team and with our Board is like, you have headwinds and tailwinds. The headwinds are the macro. The world is slowing down, right? And it has to and they're going to accomplish their goal. But we have tailwinds, okay? We have these tailwinds of like spending more on experiences, international travel, pent-up demand and then just incremental demand associated with people having to run their businesses, gather and meetings and events of all sorts, whether it's social or business. And at the moment, those tailwinds are stronger than the headwinds. And I would say meaningfully stronger, which is why we would continue to recover, we continue to have pricing power. My own belief is we have enough wind in our sails to go for a while. Now, I don't \u2013 it depends on the macro and like what happens in the economy and how long does it slow for? How much does it slow? I mean, those are things I don't know. I'm not an economist, and everybody can judge for themselves. But my view is, for the next few quarters at least, those are pretty powerful tailwinds. And we're talking to customers, we're seeing daily data, we're putting our finger on as many pulses as we can to understand it. So that's a long-winded way of saying, I don't know what the answer is for next year. But my view is RevPAR is definitely going to be up, in my opinion. Year-over-year, it will definitely be over 2019 levels. And what we're going to figure out from now to the end of the year as part of the budget process and watching the macro and watching those tailwinds and headwinds fight each other, how much we think it's going to be up. But our view is that, it is definitely going to be up. We did give you some sense quickly on that, being in the mid-single digits, so similar to this year and an expectation for next year. So if you listen super carefully, that was in my prepared comments. So we are trying to give a little bit more visibility there, because we have obviously more visibility ourselves into sort of those things tracking through pipeline and under construction and delivery schedules.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nChris Nassetta: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hi, everybody. Good morning. Chris, obviously, you guys have gotten back to returning capital much in the way you did prior to the pandemic with buybacks. But since kind of coming public again, this is the first time where you've operated in an environment where interest rates were something greater than where they've been. So I'm just wondering, as you think about your capital return strategy, you think about your cost of funding, obviously you're debt, there isn't a ton that's really rate sensitive and you have some time before you have any bonds do. How does the new interest rate environment kind of factor into your capital plans?\nChris Nassetta: Yeah. I mean, obviously, it factors into it. I'd say, first of all, background we're returning more capital than we ever have historically. And that's because we're producing more free cash flow than we ever have historically. And we intend to continue to do that. We have, from a balance sheet point of view, said we want to be at 3 to 3.5 times leverage. We still want to be in that zone. We have said we want to be towards the higher end of that, which would imply incremental borrowing that might increase our buyback. And at some point, there will be a time I suspect that we want to do that. At this moment with where the capital markets are, we probably are not to rush to go out and take on more debt to do that. But at the right time and the right place, there we might be. And there are obviously other ways of our raising capital in the form of shorter \u2013 our credit facilities and other facilities that we have. But at the moment, we are still at the mind 3 times to 3.5 times. We're probably, honestly, going to end the year a little bit lower than we might have guessed because of where the capital markets are. But we think those things will stabilize. And again, if there are opportunities that present themselves to do more than we're doing, we'll certainly look to take advantage of those opportunities. From a balance sheet point of view and maturity, we're in fabulous shape. Kevin, you can add on if you want. But we don't really have any meaningful maturities until 2026. We took great advantage both pre-COVID and then during COVID when the Fed leaded so hard to be so helpful to those markets to refinance and push out maturities. So we feel really good about the profile of our maturities, which is we have done for a number of years of any meaning and about what our current rate structure is.  So, I've been doing this a long time, these things go up and down. The Fed is doing what they have to do to harness demand. Ultimately, my guess is if history is any indicator of the future, and they overdo it a little and at some point in the next couple of years, it will go the other way.  And as I said, we have a number of ways to raise debt. The bond markets are one, which we don't honestly really like right now for obvious reasons and wouldn't look to enter those markets at the moment, but we have other forms of credit in the forms of our credit facility and other facilities that are shorter term and as a result, lower cost. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of it.  The answer is yes. But yes and no. I mean, yes, it impacts us, but it doesn't, in any way, change our trajectory of still returning significant the most capital that we ever have and we're going to continue -- we're going to fully plan to continue doing that on the basis that we're going to be producing more free cash flow this year. And by the way, if I'm right on RevPAR and going up, we're going to just produce more free cash flow next year. That is the \u2013 that gives us the ability to keep returning very large amounts of capital without having to necessarily borrow in a market we don't like.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead. \nSmedes Rose: I wanted to ask you a little bit more about what you're seeing in China and maybe kind of what the development pipeline looks like there. And with rooms, I guess, opening just into a very depressed demand, would you expect developers to pull back there or kind of how are you thinking that plays out over the next year or so?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Smedes, what I would say is it's sort of similar to -- it's kind of a microcosm of what Chris was saying on the macro. I mean, you've got some headwinds and you've got some tailwinds, right? I mean, you definitely have macroeconomic disruption there that's been well publicized. It's also -- I think we've talked about this in prior quarters, the actual way development gets done on the ground in China is still very much a face-to-face environment, a face-to-face culture. So that's affecting our level of signings at the moment.  Interestingly enough, we've had really strong signings over the last couple of years, and so starts are up in China this year, pretty -- in third quarter pretty materially and will be up for the year. Deliveries will be up for the year. And as you know, we're pivoting to more of a limited service strategy in China that's ultimately going to be less sensitive to the macro environment over time.  And so that's all sort of a mixed view and what we would say is developer optimism remains really strong. There's a lot of demand for our brands, particularly Hampton and Home 2 that are just getting started and then we're rolling out Hilton Garden franchising. So that's sort of a long way of saying, we think the trajectory is up over time in a material way, but in the short term, you do have some choppiness.\nSmedes Rose: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nDavid Katz: Hi, morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. You've given a ton of fundamental information. I get the puts and takes with all of it. I wonder if you could talk about the non-RevPAR fees to some degree as they become just an important part and how we might expect those to behave in the puts and takes around those, as well as the opportunities to grow them into other areas, et cetera, longer term. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. It's a good question. I think we -- you've heard, David, you've heard us say in prior quarters that those fees during COVID, they were less volatile, right? They sort of went down a lot less when the world blew up, and then our expectation was that they'd go up not quite at the pace of other fees, RevPAR-driven fees during recovery. Interestingly enough, in the near term, those fees are actually growing almost at the rate of our overall fee growth, right? So we've had very strong -- I mean, our two primary ways that we generate fees, of course, are credit card fees, which have been bolstered by one change we've made to the program. I think the program is as strong as it's ever been. Obviously, consumer spending has been pretty strong. So that fuels the spend and the issuance of points and fuels remuneration. HGV is doing quite well. Their fee growth has been really strong so far this year. They're public, so you can look at their numbers. I don't have to tell you how they're doing. But you should assume that we grow kind of in lockstep with them as they recover and they grow fees. And so over time, I would say they'll continue to be a more meaningful contributor. It's hard to say, in a more normalized RevPAR environment, they probably do grow at or slightly above the level of RevPAR if trends continue, and then we'll be looking for ways to continue to grow those over time. And So we're not going to get into specifics on things that haven't happened, but you should assume that the co-brand credit card product is one that can be taken outside of the primary countries that we're in now. We're getting good growth with our new products in Japan, and we'll be looking to bring that to other countries. HGV just did an acquisition, right? So they're doing quite well. And then we're always thinking about ways we've talked to you guys in the past about how to commercialize our customer base further and how to drive more revenue. So more to come on that, but that's sort of generally the story.\nDavid Katz: Understood. And I don't want to break the rules, but there was just one. SG&A came down a little bit, and I hope this is helpful to everyone. I was just curious what the driver of the SG& A guide coming in a little bit was and if it's sustainable in 2023, and then I'll stop. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, that's okay. We'll let you break the rules a little bit. Look, it's a fair question. I would say, generally, it's a really good story, right? I mean, we continue to do a good job of containing costs where as you know, we're very disciplined about spending money. There is a little bit of timing stuff in the GAAP numbers, and I know we give you the gap, and we think about it warrant cash, and it's a little bit unfair. There is a little bit of noise in the GAAP numbers, but it's still a really good story. There's still legit savings on the GAAP side. And then we think about it more on the cash side, right? What are we actually spending on overhead? And our cash G&A this year for the full year is going to be sort of down in the low to mid-teens relative to 2019. That's not to say there aren't some headwinds in terms of as the business recovers and people move around a little bit more, cost of labor, inflation is a real thing. But we still think that over time, we'll be able to grow our G& A base sort of around the level of inflation going forward. And so you'll see sort of permanent -- that's part of what's driving the margin improvements that Chris was talking about earlier in the call.\nDavid Katz: Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead. \nRobin Farley: Great. Circling back to you having more rooms under construction than you did a quarter ago. I know you talked a bit about China and that starts are up there. Can you talk about what's going on with US rooms under construction? And it's just what we hear from others is that it's been so much more challenging to get developers to put shovels in the ground, right, outside of the signings, actually putting a shovel in the ground. And so is what you saw here in Q3 an anomaly in terms of having more refund construction sequentially, or is that something that you think you'll continue to see. Thanks.\nChris Nassetta: Well, we certainly hope we continue to see it. I mean, it is definitely an inflection point in the third quarter, which we think continues into the fourth quarter. While it's certainly relative to normal times, if there is such a thing, it's more difficult in terms of cost to build financing availability. The other thing that's happened is the recovery has been much, much steeper than anybody thought. And obviously, unlike any other recovery period, rate strength has way outperformed what anybody had thought. And when you look at it, you could look at the majority of our system, which we do, the majority of our system, the hotels are generating greater profitability than they ever have, greater than 2019, which was the prior high watermark. So, what is that -- what is happening? That is then fueling optimism. We'll talk about the US because you asked about the US, it's fueling optimism in people wanting to do more deals. This is -- we have a very diversified owner base. It's mostly small and medium businesses. This is what they do. It isn't a part of what they do. It's 100% for the most part of what they do, and they like what they see and they're making gobs of money in most of their hotels, and they want to do more of it, and they want to lock up the best brands to pat us on the back. We have the highest-performing brands in the business, the highest market share across on average and across each of the segments. And so we, I think, are disproportionately benefiting from that. And how it's showing up is, as Kevin, I think, mentioned in his prepared comments, we're going to be over 2019 levels on signings this year in the US. And that -- and a percentage of those are translating into starts, and that's why we have seen the uptick in starts starting in the third quarter that we think is going to continue in the fourth quarter. Now, there's a lot of uncertainty. I don't -- like how many different ways we can say it, and everybody is asking the question says it., So there's a lot of uncertainty out in the future, but we are seeing an inflection point. And we are certainly -- expect that to continue and are hopeful it continues for an extended period of time. While input costs are higher, the reality is those things are starting to stabilize a little bit. And you've seen other forms of construction drop off, which have provided more availability of subcontractors. And while the big banks are still -- it's still challenging from a lending point of view, our ownership community broadly is getting financed in local and regional banks, and they've still with the strongest relationships, been willing to finance. Now, they're putting more equity up, they're providing, in many cases, full recourse and rates are higher. But I think their view is rates are higher for a period of time. These are short-term financings that ultimately, when assets stabilize, will be in a different environment and longer they can convert to longer-term financing that's more reasonable. So, while it is clearly net-net harder, there are a lot of reasons. As I say, if you just look at the behavior of our broader owner community, they're signing more deals, and we've hit an inflection point on starts and we like seeing that. And we think our performance and market share and all of those things are meaningful contributors to it. And we'll keep you up to speed as we watch those tailwinds and headwinds in a macro environment to see if that changes, but we were -- we've been very pleased with that momentum.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you for the color. And just for my follow-up question, if I could ask about group. You mentioned your position for 2023 is 5% ahead of 2019. And I think that's a total revenue position. And just given how much disruption there's been that groups that were not necessarily booking as far out because of the disruption from the pandemic, it seems like, I'm just thinking about the impact on your RevPAR for next year, that the benefit to you is that if they're booking closer in, you're going to be able to get these, sort of, current rates as opposed to like historically group, you're stuck with whatever rates you agreed to two years ago. Can you give us a sense of maybe how much the volume is down? Like thinking about like the incremental price that you may get on. I don't know how significant that volume delta between now and what you have in 2019 one.\nChris Nassetta: Let me sync up on stats because I think maybe I misheard you, or you misstated what I said when I gave group stats. So we're 5% up in the fourth quarter. By the way, if you go back a couple of quarters ago, we were not. We were 5% or 10% down. So again, the business has been picking up at a very rapid pace, but it is relatively short lead. We are 9% or 10% often group position system-wide for 2023, not ahead. But our tentatives and pipeline are literally off the charts. I mean, when we sit here and talk to our sales teams, across the world, the biggest issue is just having enough people to keep up with all the demand. There's a massive amount of demand, and it is short lead demand. So when we look into next year, just given the experience we've been having, it makes us feel very, very good about being able to fill in that group base and ultimately get group back, which was that 93% in the third quarter. We think it will be, from a revenue point of view, roughly at par in the fourth quarter. And we think given this trajectory, it will be above 19 high watermarks next year. Thus, another contributor like leisure, which we think will stay strong, and business transient, which we think is picking up steam and will stay strong, to why we think next year will be a reasonably a very good positive year. In terms of rates -- that is a good thing in the sense that we do, I think, have a reason -- if all these segments stay stable to strong, we have an ability to maintain pricing power that I think is, again, just back to the fundamentals of the business that, I think, is reasonably good. And we've been booking new business at much higher rates. You're right, existing business is booked at less high rates, although still reasonable rates.  Most of those are equal to or greater than 2019 rates. And at this point, the majority of our bookings for all of next year, I would say, are still to be booked. We're probably roughly half of our bookings, maybe plus or minus, are on the books at this point in the year and everything that's going on between now and the end of the year, we will go into next year higher than that, in my opinion, given the demand. But all of those bookings will be at the higher rate structure. So we think there's both the opportunity for the demand to get back and then exceed base demand levels of 2019 and to do it at a higher rate, which, for that segment, will contribute meaningfully to RevPAR growth. Just to think back to what it normally was, our system-wide group was about 20% of our business in 2019. Right now, it's about 16%, 17%. So we think next year will normalize and be pretty close to, if not, at historical levels of demand from a segmentation point of view.\nRobin Farley: Great. Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, you mentioned that one of the areas of the Q3 came from the better European ownership segment, which is probably benefiting from a stronger US dollar and just overall recovery. Can you talk about how you're thinking about this segment, the margins around that maybe in the fourth quarter and beyond? I know at the beginning of the year, there was probably a little bit more pessimism. And I'd say in the last two quarters, this has probably come in ahead of expectations and push numbers higher? Just trying to level set on that. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobs: Yeah, sure. I think, yeah, that's completely fair. I mean, I think that Europe has continued to despite what -- if you -- the rhetoric over there and what they're bracing for in the winter and things like that, we talked about all the time around here, the operating results have continued to defy gravity, and you heard the results that I've said in my prepared remarks, which are its growth in excess, both obviously on an absolute basis because of how far it fell, but relative to 2019 in excess of the other regions of the world. That clearly has translated through to our real estate portfolio or at least the part of it that is concentrated in that part of the world, the UK and Central Europe. I'd say for the fourth quarter, similar to what we've said about the macro, we don't see any reason to believe that won't continue. And then you probably, in that part of the world, have some headwinds next year. I mean, you think about the inflation that they've got going on, that affects labor, that affects, energy, costs and utilities and things like that, although the fundamental environment holds up, we should do just fine. And then Japan, where we have a couple of large leases, again, they just opened the country up, demand is starting to pour in, and that's a part of the portfolio that could be a headwind. And so I'd say to wrap it all up, on a run rate basis, we're about three quarters of the way back to 2019 levels. So we don't see any reason why that portfolio doesn't continue to recover to where it was, which should continue to enhance our growth rate broadly overall. And I think it's always worth mentioning that that, keep in mind that the rest of the business, the fee business is growing at a nice clip, and that portfolio continues to get smaller over time because of the work we've done there. So we exited seven leases last year. We'll exit another two or three of them this year. I think two or three a year is probably the right way to think about it. And that business will be -- you wake up a few years from now, that will be 5% or less of the overall business.\nChad Beynon: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nChris Nassetta: Morning.\nPatrick Scholes: I wonder if we could talk a little bit more about the group pace. If I got my numbers correct, you said next year down roughly 9% to 10%, and then you said for 4Q, up 5%. I wonder since you reported in the end of July, how is the pace been going for those two different periods? It certainly sounds like 4Q was up, but what was the comparable pace for next year when you last reported\u2026?\nChris Nassetta: Best I remember, they both moved about 500 basis points in the quarter.\nQ \u2013 Patrick Scholes: Correct.\nA \u2013 Chris Nassetta: Up. Better. Better.\nQ \u2013 Patrick Scholes: Okay. And then do you have any -- I know it's early, but any indications on sort of the longer -- how are corporations feeling about 2024, 2025 at this point? I guess, it's fair to assume that they are probably a lot more cautious than they would be to book a holiday party at this point?\nA \u2013 Chris Nassetta: Yeah, I mean, that's not -- the business that gets booked that far out is typically the mega size groups. The association groups and other trade groups, and not so much -- I mean, corporations don't -- they don't book their small meetings or their social events. That's a relatively short cycle. But when you look at the big -- I think I mentioned -- I know I mentioned in my prepared comments, what we're seeing in terms of the mix on a forward-looking basis in bookings on the group side is looking a lot like the mix from pre-COVID, which by definition means we're getting a much bigger mix of the very large meetings and events that are getting booked. It's not surprising. It took some time to get there. And to get the revenue consumed, we'll take more time because these are huge multi-thousand person events, many of them citywide. They just take a long time to plan and implement. But that is definitely starting to happen as you talk to convention, visitor, CVBs around the country that is starting to happen. And it makes sense. Notwithstanding the macro concerns out there, a lot of these groups have to meet to survive. I mean, these are events that it's not just networking, these are revenue raising events that allow these trade groups and associations to be alive. And so they can only go so long in not doing these. And the reason they weren't doing them before was -- and by the way, they're generally very resilient in economic ups and downs, the big mega groups that book multiyears out, because there's too much planning and money involved. The reason that they uniquely during COVID were impacted was health. Like nobody -- if you're having an event that nobody shows up, well then we'll pay the registration fee and then you have a big expense of putting on the event, you not only don't make money, you can lose a lot of money. But now that we're sort of like -- I don't want to be the guy that declares that COVID is sort of over in the sense that it's not gone and there's variance, people aren't making decisions in terms of their behavior, both personally and professionally. And in meetings and events that are factoring for that, I think all of these groups now view it as it's a safe time from a health point of view to do it and they need to do it. And so they're very deep into the booking and planning processes. And so it sort of makes sense. The unique thing was the health issue this time, which we had to sort of get through. But I think at this point, notwithstanding things going on in COVID, I mean, just go into the airport, go into any one of our big hotels or anywhere else, and you can see that when these events are happening, they're very normal. It looks just like it did before.\nQ \u2013 Patrick Scholes: Okay. Chris, I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nA \u2013 Chris Nassetta: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Duane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks very much. Maybe switch gears a little bit. I wanted to ask you about revenue management systems. One of the things we've heard from operators recently is a preference for Hilton RM systems and the concept of pricing floors in those systems moving up. Can you speak to the investment you've made around RM? What do you think your special sauce is there and how you might be viewing pricing floors and institutionalizing those pricing floors differently than you have in the past?\nChris Nassetta: I'll let Kevin answer. But competitively, we're probably not going to give you quite a detailed answer that you want.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, I was going to say that. But, yes, we probably won't get into the way the algorithms work or any -- I don't even know, I can't even bring myself to say that out loud. But, look, I'd say, we have a long history of being really good at revenue management. And it is part of our special sauce. We say all the time, you can't really unpack all of the different things that we do commercially and say it's that -- that one thing is x basis points of RevPAR index premium, right? It all goes into the premiums that we drive. But, I would say, we, in our history, we have a vendor that we work with. We co-created the algorithm with them. We work -- they've been an amazing partner. We work really hard with them. And we think we're really good at it. We've created the concept of the consolidated center. We drive more of our owners that sign up to be in these consolidated centers where we help them. We don't set pricing for the vast majority of our system, right, because 75% of it's franchise, and it's ultimately up to the franchisees to set the pricing. But we can advise them on how we do it, and we're really good at it and it's part of our special sauce, and I\u2019d probably just leave it at that. I don't know got anything to add.\nChris Nassetta: And -- no, I would say, that's right. And we don't stop. I mean, it's not a system. In the old days, these systems are like, build a new system and then you let it run for a long time. We\u2019re -- these algorithms are being tweaked constantly to add incremental data fields that used to be in revenue management in our world. It was really just like data related to the hotel. Now, we have data sets, because the world is awash in data that are contributing to the decision-making in these algorithms and just make it smarter. During COVID and the aftermath of COVID, one of the big things has not been less about floors and more about ceilings. And so, I think, we've been very thoughtful about that as well. So, yes, it's part of our -- one of the many things that we think we -- our commercial teams are second to none in the industry, not just in revenue management. But in every other regard, but this is one area that we think we do a really good job.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts.\nChris Nassetta: Yes.\nOperator: Next question is from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Thanks for taking my question. This is a bit of a follow-up on the last topic and on pricing power broadly. Prior to the pandemic, there were regular questions, it seemed on why rate was so hard to push even as occupancies were near peak. Given that there seems to be very little pricing pushback now, how would you frame what has changed cyclically versus structurally? Do you consider the changes in consumer behavior, distribution, yield management as you were describing or other factors? Thanks.\nChris Nassetta: Thanks, Stephen, good to have you on the call. I mean, not to be pedantic about it, but maybe I'll sound that way. It's just the loss of economics. I mean, I don't know how many times I got asked in the lead up to the pandemic. Why can't you get rate pressure? I'm not going to accuse you of it, but probably got asked a thousand times by you and everybody else. And my comment there is just, there was no compression. You were in an environment where, while supply wasn't high, it was over 30-year averages, and more importantly, demand was low, because you were in this very low work growth environment where GDP was vacillating between like 0% and 2%. And you put those -- you were an equilibrium. I mean, supply and demand, or maybe even a little bit at an equilibrium in the wrong way, and that doesn't give you pricing power.\nKevin Jacobs: And no inflation.\nChris Nassetta: And no inflation. Now, you have all the things that allow you to have pricing power. You have very limited capacity for what will be an extended period of time, robust demand growth that we're talking about and broader inflationary pressures. And those things are different to the laws of economics. As they say around here, they're alive and well, and that's what's happening. They were driving the results prepandemic and they're driving this result just a different set of conditions.\nStephen Grambling: Makes sense. Thanks for getting me on. I\u2019ll leave it with one.\nChris Nassetta: Sounds good.\nOperator: The next question is from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandt Montour: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Chris or Kevin, I'm curious if you have thoughts about the conversion activity into a potential macro slowdown. And the basis for the question is that, that activity historically has acted sort of countercyclical for obvious reasons, but you guys just had a cycle where conversion activity was really high. So I guess, was there a pull forward of the conversion activity into 2020 and 2021 and 2022, that we would have maybe normally seen in a macro type of slowdown which we could eventually see?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, I don't think -- it's a good question, Brandt. I don't think there's been a pull forward. I mean, we're still going to do roughly 25% of our rooms additions this year as conversions. You're right, that interestingly, it does tend to be countercyclical. And I think this is what you're saying, but I'll just say it anyway, look, sort of rising tide -- conversions actually get tougher in really strong fundamental environments, right? Rising tides lift all boats. And so, if you think of an independent hotel that may be considering needing a brand in a really strong demand environment, they need us a little bit less. And so the pace of convergence goes down. So that's actually a little bit, interestingly, a little bit of a headwind right now. And then the other thing that drives it is a lot of them happen around transactions, right? And at the moment, because of people thinking about macro headwinds going forward, transaction activity has slowed somewhat because bid-ask spreads have widened in those markets. And so there aren't as many assets trading. So that's a little bit of a headwind. And I think actually a downturn can sort of be a strong tailwind on both of those fronts, right? If you get a little bit of a reset in people's outlook, you sort of have a downturn, then the outlook gets better, capital costs sort of adjust, rates come down, spreads widen, you actually then see a pickup in transaction activity, which helps. And then during the downturn, as demand softens, people need us more. So, we think that conversions will continue to be a big part of the story. And interestingly enough, a little bit of a softening in the macro could be a nice tailwind there.\nBrandt Montour: Makes sense. Thanks for all the thoughts.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Thanks, everybody, for the time. As always, we appreciate the great questions and opportunity to give you a little bit of color on everything going on. Obviously, the macro environment is a little bit uncertain. And like you, we're watching it very carefully. But as you heard today, we remain really optimistic, certainly, about the long term of the business given the position that we're in from a brand strength and margin and overall enterprise-wide point of view. But we also remain optimistic in the short to medium term, just given that these tailwinds that we've talked about several times today are pretty strong. And we continue to see very good trends and very good recovery across all the segments. So we'll look forward after the end of the year to giving you a sense of the fourth quarter, and obviously, a little bit more visibility into how we think about 2023. Thanks again. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system wide RevPAR grew 29.9% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis and increased 5% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength in leisure demand, as well as steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $732 million in the quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 41% year-over-year. Our performance was driven by better than expected fee growth, particularly across the Americas and Europe. Results also benefited from further recovery in our European ownership portfolio. Management franchise fees grew 33%, driven by continued RevPAR improvement and strong Honors license fees. Good cost control continued to benefit results. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.31, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and increasing 68% year-over-year. Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 22% year-over-year and was up 6% versus 2019. Performance continued to be led by strong leisure demand over the summer travel season, with continued recovery in business transient and group travel further benefiting results. Total US business transient reached 2019 levels for the quarter, with US group RevPAR up 7 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 95% of 2019 peak levels. In the Americas outside the US, third quarter RevPAR increased 74% year-over-year and was up 17% versus 2019. Performance was driven by continued strength in leisure demand, particularly across resort properties where ADR was up more than 20%. In Europe, RevPAR grew 92% year-over-year and was up 20% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong leisure demand and international inbound travel throughout the summer. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 45% year-over-year and was up 6% versus 2019. The region continued to benefit from strong leisure demand and international inbound travel, particularly from Europe. In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR was up 46% year-over-year and down 16% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 14% compared to 2019, improving 33 percentage points quarter-over-quarter as leisure demand picked up over the school holidays and COVID lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing were lifted in July. Travel demand remains volatile in China as a result of strict COVID policies and restrictions to contain new outbreaks. The rest of the Asia Pacific region saw continued improvement with RevPAR, excluding China, up 10 points quarter-over-quarter, with September RevPAR down just 8% to 2019. We remain optimistic about further recovery across the entire Asia Pacific region as travel restrictions continue to ease and borders reopen to international travel. For example, our recent booking pace in Japan has already started to increase following the recent government stimulus announcement and border openings. Turning to development. Our pipeline grew year-over-year and sequentially, totaling nearly 416,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with nearly 60% of pipeline rooms located outside the US and roughly half under construction. For the full year, we still expect net unit growth of approximately 5% and signings of approximately 100,000 rooms globally with US signings exceeding 2019 levels. Despite the near-term macroeconomic challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver net unit growth in the mid-single-digit range for the next couple of years. Moving to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 19% and 23% year-over-year or up 2% to 6% compared to fourth quarter 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $641 million and $671 million and adjusted EPS adjusted for special items -- I'm sorry, diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.15 and $1.23. For full year 2022, we expect RevPAR growth between 40% and 43%. Relative to 2019, we expect RevPAR to be down 1% to 3%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.5 billion and $2.53 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA forecast represents a year-over-year increase of more than 50% at the midpoint and exceeds 2019 adjusted EBITDA by nearly 10%. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $4.46 and $4.54. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $41 million year-to-date. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our third quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please? Yes, Smedes, what I would say is it's sort of similar to -- it's kind of a microcosm of what Chris was saying on the macro. I mean, you've got some headwinds and you've got some tailwinds, right? I mean, you definitely have macroeconomic disruption there that's been well publicized. It's also -- I think we've talked about this in prior quarters, the actual way development gets done on the ground in China is still very much a face-to-face environment, a face-to-face culture. So that's affecting our level of signings at the moment.  Interestingly enough, we've had really strong signings over the last couple of years, and so starts are up in China this year, pretty -- in third quarter pretty materially and will be up for the year. Deliveries will be up for the year. And as you know, we're pivoting to more of a limited service strategy in China that's ultimately going to be less sensitive to the macro environment over time.  And so that's all sort of a mixed view and what we would say is developer optimism remains really strong. There's a lot of demand for our brands, particularly Hampton and Home 2 that are just getting started and then we're rolling out Hilton Garden franchising. So that's sort of a long way of saying, we think the trajectory is up over time in a material way, but in the short term, you do have some choppiness. Yes, sure. It's a good question. I think we -- you've heard, David, you've heard us say in prior quarters that those fees during COVID, they were less volatile, right? They sort of went down a lot less when the world blew up, and then our expectation was that they'd go up not quite at the pace of other fees, RevPAR-driven fees during recovery. Interestingly enough, in the near term, those fees are actually growing almost at the rate of our overall fee growth, right? So we've had very strong -- I mean, our two primary ways that we generate fees, of course, are credit card fees, which have been bolstered by one change we've made to the program. I think the program is as strong as it's ever been. Obviously, consumer spending has been pretty strong. So that fuels the spend and the issuance of points and fuels remuneration. HGV is doing quite well. Their fee growth has been really strong so far this year. They're public, so you can look at their numbers. I don't have to tell you how they're doing. But you should assume that we grow kind of in lockstep with them as they recover and they grow fees. And so over time, I would say they'll continue to be a more meaningful contributor. It's hard to say, in a more normalized RevPAR environment, they probably do grow at or slightly above the level of RevPAR if trends continue, and then we'll be looking for ways to continue to grow those over time. And So we're not going to get into specifics on things that haven't happened, but you should assume that the co-brand credit card product is one that can be taken outside of the primary countries that we're in now. We're getting good growth with our new products in Japan, and we'll be looking to bring that to other countries. HGV just did an acquisition, right? So they're doing quite well. And then we're always thinking about ways we've talked to you guys in the past about how to commercialize our customer base further and how to drive more revenue. So more to come on that, but that's sort of generally the story. Yes, that's okay. We'll let you break the rules a little bit. Look, it's a fair question. I would say, generally, it's a really good story, right? I mean, we continue to do a good job of containing costs where as you know, we're very disciplined about spending money. There is a little bit of timing stuff in the GAAP numbers, and I know we give you the gap, and we think about it warrant cash, and it's a little bit unfair. There is a little bit of noise in the GAAP numbers, but it's still a really good story. There's still legit savings on the GAAP side. And then we think about it more on the cash side, right? What are we actually spending on overhead? And our cash G&A this year for the full year is going to be sort of down in the low to mid-teens relative to 2019. That's not to say there aren't some headwinds in terms of as the business recovers and people move around a little bit more, cost of labor, inflation is a real thing. But we still think that over time, we'll be able to grow our G& A base sort of around the level of inflation going forward. And so you'll see sort of permanent -- that's part of what's driving the margin improvements that Chris was talking about earlier in the call. Yeah, sure. I think, yeah, that's completely fair. I mean, I think that Europe has continued to despite what -- if you -- the rhetoric over there and what they're bracing for in the winter and things like that, we talked about all the time around here, the operating results have continued to defy gravity, and you heard the results that I've said in my prepared remarks, which are its growth in excess, both obviously on an absolute basis because of how far it fell, but relative to 2019 in excess of the other regions of the world. That clearly has translated through to our real estate portfolio or at least the part of it that is concentrated in that part of the world, the UK and Central Europe. I'd say for the fourth quarter, similar to what we've said about the macro, we don't see any reason to believe that won't continue. And then you probably, in that part of the world, have some headwinds next year. I mean, you think about the inflation that they've got going on, that affects labor, that affects, energy, costs and utilities and things like that, although the fundamental environment holds up, we should do just fine. And then Japan, where we have a couple of large leases, again, they just opened the country up, demand is starting to pour in, and that's a part of the portfolio that could be a headwind. And so I'd say to wrap it all up, on a run rate basis, we're about three quarters of the way back to 2019 levels. So we don't see any reason why that portfolio doesn't continue to recover to where it was, which should continue to enhance our growth rate broadly overall. And I think it's always worth mentioning that that, keep in mind that the rest of the business, the fee business is growing at a nice clip, and that portfolio continues to get smaller over time because of the work we've done there. So we exited seven leases last year. We'll exit another two or three of them this year. I think two or three a year is probably the right way to think about it. And that business will be -- you wake up a few years from now, that will be 5% or less of the overall business. Sure. Yes, I was going to say that. But, yes, we probably won't get into the way the algorithms work or any -- I don't even know, I can't even bring myself to say that out loud. But, look, I'd say, we have a long history of being really good at revenue management. And it is part of our special sauce. We say all the time, you can't really unpack all of the different things that we do commercially and say it's that -- that one thing is x basis points of RevPAR index premium, right? It all goes into the premiums that we drive. But, I would say, we, in our history, we have a vendor that we work with. We co-created the algorithm with them. We work -- they've been an amazing partner. We work really hard with them. And we think we're really good at it. We've created the concept of the consolidated center. We drive more of our owners that sign up to be in these consolidated centers where we help them. We don't set pricing for the vast majority of our system, right, because 75% of it's franchise, and it's ultimately up to the franchisees to set the pricing. But we can advise them on how we do it, and we're really good at it and it's part of our special sauce, and I'd probably just leave it at that. I don't know got anything to add. And no inflation. Yes, I don't think -- it's a good question, Brandt. I don't think there's been a pull forward. I mean, we're still going to do roughly 25% of our rooms additions this year as conversions. You're right, that interestingly, it does tend to be countercyclical. And I think this is what you're saying, but I'll just say it anyway, look, sort of rising tide -- conversions actually get tougher in really strong fundamental environments, right? Rising tides lift all boats. And so, if you think of an independent hotel that may be considering needing a brand in a really strong demand environment, they need us a little bit less. And so the pace of convergence goes down. So that's actually a little bit, interestingly, a little bit of a headwind right now. And then the other thing that drives it is a lot of them happen around transactions, right? And at the moment, because of people thinking about macro headwinds going forward, transaction activity has slowed somewhat because bid-ask spreads have widened in those markets. And so there aren't as many assets trading. So that's a little bit of a headwind. And I think actually a downturn can sort of be a strong tailwind on both of those fronts, right?

And interestingly enough, a little bit of a softening in the macro could be a nice tailwind there. Sure."

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The third quarter marked a very important milestone in our continued recovery. For the first time since the pandemic began, system-wide RevPAR surpassed 2019 levels. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance and 2019 levels. We achieved several notable development milestones in the quarter, including reaching 100,000 rooms open across Europe, and announced various strategic partnerships, further enhancing the guest experience and the strength of our global system. The quarter's strong performance, coupled with our capital-light business model, enabled us to continue returning meaningful capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $1.3 billion. And for the full year, we're on track to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders. Turning to the specifics results in the quarter, occupancy reached more than 73%, only four points shy of 2019 levels. As expected, strong travel demand continued through the summer months, primarily driven by robust leisure trends. Post Labor Day, demand remained strong as business transient and group demand improved significantly and leisure demand remained robust. Overall demand for the quarter peaked in September, nearly reaching 2019 levels with business transient demand only two points off 2019 levels. ADR also continued to strengthen and proving quarter-over-quarter and up 11% versus 2019. Rates across all segments surpass 2019 levels, with leisure transient rates up in the high-teens and both business transient and grew up in the mid-single digits. All of this translated into third quarter system-wide RevPAR growth of approximately 30% year-over-year, and 5% compared to 2019 levels, with each month surpassing prior peaks. Leisure transient RevPAR continued to lead the recovery, exceeding 2019 levels by more than 11% for the quarter. Business transient RevPAR reached 2019 levels, with notable acceleration in large corporate business. Our top 20 business accounts are now just 3% shy of 2019 levels, with forward bookings trending above 2019. Small and medium-sized businesses remain ahead of 2019 levels. Group RevPAR reached roughly 93% of prior peak levels for the quarter, with company meetings improving significantly as a percentage of mix. We expect trends to remain strong for the balance of the year with system-wide RevPAR once again surpassing 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Leisure transient RevPAR is expected to remain meaningfully above prior peaks, driven by solid consumer confidence and continued eagerness and ability to travel. We expect business transient RevPAR to continue to see gradual recovery, primarily driven by rising demand as companies encourage their people to get back on the road. System-wide group position for the fourth quarter is approximately 5% above 2019 levels, accelerating over the last several months, largely due to a robust demand pipeline. Additionally, rates on new bookings are up in the mid to high-teens versus 2019, with group mix continuing to normalize. Company meetings and convention business make up a larger percentage of forward bookings versus the same period in 2019. As we look ahead, we remain very optimistic about the future of travel. Despite near-term macro headwinds, we're not seeing any signs that fundamentals are weakening. Rising demand, coupled with historically low industry supply growth, should continue to drive strong pricing power. Consumers are shifting back to spending on experiences, international borders are reopening and pent-up demand is being released across all segments. Consumers still have an estimated $2.4 trillion of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic, or approximately 55% more in their checking and savings accounts than they did in 2019. Additionally, according to a recent global Hilton study, 85% of business travelers hope to travel as much or more next year, and group position for 2023 is less than 10% shy of 2019 peak levels, with a tentative pipeline up significantly. While the macro environment is more challenging, we are in the midst of a strong rebound with secular tailwinds that should support continued growth. Turning to development, we opened 80 properties, totaling nearly 13,000 rooms in the quarter and achieved several important milestones, including reaching 100,000 rooms in Europe, 25,000 Curio rooms globally and 600 Hilton Hotels & Resorts. All of our brands continue growing at a healthy pace given their distinct identities and compelling value propositions for both owners and guests. According to STR, our year-to-date net additions remain higher than all major branded competitors, demonstrating the power of our disciplined development strategy and the strength of our industry-leading RevPAR index premiums. During the quarter, we signed approximately 20,000 rooms, bringing our pipeline to a record 416,000 rooms, half of which are under construction. Signings were boosted by strong RevPAR performance in the US, which drove greater owner optimism around the recovery. While macro factors tempered international signings, we were thrilled to announce nine landmark agreements to expand our luxury presence across seven countries in the Asia Pacific region, including the Conrad, Singapore Orchard. We also signed agreements to grow our flagship Hilton brand in Malaysia, Waldorf and Morocco in what will become our first system-wide tempo property in Times Square. Construction starts outperformed expectations in the quarter, largely due to better activity in the US as the cost of materials stabilized and demand for residential construction declined. According to STR, Hilton is the only major hotel company to deliver year-to-date growth in its under construction pipeline. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of approximately 5%, and we expect mid-single-digit growth for the next couple of years before returning to our historical growth rate of 6% to 7%. With even more exciting destinations to enjoy, we continue strengthening our value proposition for Hilton Honors members. In the quarter, Honors membership grew 19% year-over-year to $146 million, and members accounted for more than 61% of occupancy, up 200 basis points year-over-year and roughly in line with 2019. We also continue to invest in new innovations focused on ensuring we deliver reliable friendly stays that meet guests' evolving needs. An overwhelming 98% of guests in a recent survey said they are prioritizing wellness activities while on the road. During the quarter, we announced an industry-first partnership with Peloton to add Peloton bikes in every fitness center across all of our 5,400 US properties by year-end. Our extremely talented team works tirelessly to execute on a great strategy, and we continue to be recognized for our award winning culture. Hilton was recently named the number one Best Workplace for Women in the US and the number two on the World's Best Workplaces by Fortune and Great Place to Work, our seventh consecutive year on the list and the only hospitality company on the list. As we begin a new golden age of travel, I think we're better positioned than ever. Our brands are performing at their highest levels, we're running our highest margins in our company's history and we're on track to generate our highest levels of free cash flow yet. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you a bit more details on the quarter and our expectations for the full year. Good morning, Joe. I'll take it in the order you gave it. Just by way of background, you asked where was it in 2019. It was about 10% of our overall business in 2019. At the moment, it's about 7% of our overall business. And that is largely at this point given the big accounts are coming back by choice because we have chosen to pivot our mix as we've been talking about for the last several quarters a little bit more heavily towards SMB, small and medium-sized enterprises, simply because they are higher rated and more resilient through ups and downs. Having said that, our big corporate customers have been customers of ours a long time, and they're important, but we have weighted that down. I think as they I mentioned that we were most recently only really about 3% off with our top 20, my guess is that 7% will go up a bit, but our objective is to keep it a bit lower than 2019. We're early in that negotiation season, and what I can say at this point in talking to our teams is the vast majority of those accounts are going to dynamic pricing. That's something that we've been doing over a very long period of time, even pre-COVID. We did have the majority of the accounts dynamic, but we had a decent chunk, I want to say, 25% or 30% pre-COVID. And through the last few years, we've moved very aggressively to get more people dynamic. So at this point, the majority of them are dynamic. And I think that all customers understand because of what they're dealing with in every aspect of their life, that is that, at least at the moment, inflation is a real thing and that their expectation is that they're going to have to pay more. And the best \u2013 it's early days. The best we think at this point is high single-digit, very low double digit sort of in 9% to 10% range is best we can figure at this moment. Yeah. I think you're right. There's a lot of macro uncertainty. And as a result, it's a little bit early for us to prognosticate on what we think for next year. Not only that, but we're just at the early stages of our budget process, which we'll be going through over the next 60 days or so, to complete by year-end. And so it is premature. Having said that, directionally, I'm happy to comment on, sort of how we and I think about it at the moment on a forward-looking basis. What we're obviously looking at, as I said in my prepared comments, is fundamentals that are currently pretty strong. And while, again, we're not naive to what's going on with the Fed here in central banks in other parts of the world in the sense of trying to tame inflation by slowing economies, we do think we have a reasonably unique setup that is maybe different than some other industries for a period of time that is going to benefit us not just in the fourth quarter, but into next year. What are those things? Not to be too redundant because I covered them briefly, the laws of economics are alive and well, supply and demand. Supply is at historically low-levels, and it's going to stay there for a while, right, just given everything that's going on from COVID and now into the macro concerns. Demand, is picking up. As I covered relative to the third quarter, our expectation is that it's going to continue to pick up into the fourth quarter. Why is it picking up? It's picking up because the segments remain strong. I mean, leisure, I covered it. People still have desire and a lot of disposable income and savings to spend and more flexibility and time. Business transient that you have a huge amount of pent-up demand that's accrued, as well as in the meetings and events segment, you have the international markets opening up. And you have a broader trend of just the secular shift or maybe cyclical shift back to the more normalized spending patterns of everybody is spending less on things and spending more on experiences. And so, that's what we're benefiting from. We obviously got hammered during COVID, unlike other industries. But now we're in this recovery. And those -- I sort of describe it here with our team and with our Board is like, you have headwinds and tailwinds. The headwinds are the macro. The world is slowing down, right? And it has to and they're going to accomplish their goal. But we have tailwinds, okay? We have these tailwinds of like spending more on experiences, international travel, pent-up demand and then just incremental demand associated with people having to run their businesses, gather and meetings and events of all sorts, whether it's social or business. And at the moment, those tailwinds are stronger than the headwinds. And I would say meaningfully stronger, which is why we would continue to recover, we continue to have pricing power. My own belief is we have enough wind in our sails to go for a while. Now, I don't \u2013 it depends on the macro and like what happens in the economy and how long does it slow for? How much does it slow? I mean, those are things I don't know. I'm not an economist, and everybody can judge for themselves. But my view is, for the next few quarters at least, those are pretty powerful tailwinds. And we're talking to customers, we're seeing daily data, we're putting our finger on as many pulses as we can to understand it. So that's a long-winded way of saying, I don't know what the answer is for next year. But my view is RevPAR is definitely going to be up, in my opinion. Year-over-year, it will definitely be over 2019 levels. And what we're going to figure out from now to the end of the year as part of the budget process and watching the macro and watching those tailwinds and headwinds fight each other, how much we think it's going to be up. But our view is that, it is definitely going to be up. We did give you some sense quickly on that, being in the mid-single digits, so similar to this year and an expectation for next year. So if you listen super carefully, that was in my prepared comments. So we are trying to give a little bit more visibility there, because we have obviously more visibility ourselves into sort of those things tracking through pipeline and under construction and delivery schedules. Sure. Yeah. I mean, obviously, it factors into it. I'd say, first of all, background we're returning more capital than we ever have historically. And that's because we're producing more free cash flow than we ever have historically. And we intend to continue to do that. We have, from a balance sheet point of view, said we want to be at 3 to 3.5 times leverage. We still want to be in that zone. We have said we want to be towards the higher end of that, which would imply incremental borrowing that might increase our buyback. And at some point, there will be a time I suspect that we want to do that. At this moment with where the capital markets are, we probably are not to rush to go out and take on more debt to do that. But at the right time and the right place, there we might be. And there are obviously other ways of our raising capital in the form of shorter \u2013 our credit facilities and other facilities that we have. But at the moment, we are still at the mind 3 times to 3.5 times. We're probably, honestly, going to end the year a little bit lower than we might have guessed because of where the capital markets are. But we think those things will stabilize. And again, if there are opportunities that present themselves to do more than we're doing, we'll certainly look to take advantage of those opportunities. From a balance sheet point of view and maturity, we're in fabulous shape. Kevin, you can add on if you want. But we don't really have any meaningful maturities until 2026. We took great advantage both pre-COVID and then during COVID when the Fed leaded so hard to be so helpful to those markets to refinance and push out maturities. So we feel really good about the profile of our maturities, which is we have done for a number of years of any meaning and about what our current rate structure is.  So, I've been doing this a long time, these things go up and down. The Fed is doing what they have to do to harness demand. Ultimately, my guess is if history is any indicator of the future, and they overdo it a little and at some point in the next couple of years, it will go the other way.  And as I said, we have a number of ways to raise debt. The bond markets are one, which we don't honestly really like right now for obvious reasons and wouldn't look to enter those markets at the moment, but we have other forms of credit in the forms of our credit facility and other facilities that are shorter term and as a result, lower cost. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of it.  The answer is yes. But yes and no. I mean, yes, it impacts us, but it doesn't, in any way, change our trajectory of still returning significant the most capital that we ever have and we're going to continue -- we're going to fully plan to continue doing that on the basis that we're going to be producing more free cash flow this year. And by the way, if I'm right on RevPAR and going up, we're going to just produce more free cash flow next year. That is the \u2013 that gives us the ability to keep returning very large amounts of capital without having to necessarily borrow in a market we don't like. Well, we certainly hope we continue to see it. I mean, it is definitely an inflection point in the third quarter, which we think continues into the fourth quarter. While it's certainly relative to normal times, if there is such a thing, it's more difficult in terms of cost to build financing availability. The other thing that's happened is the recovery has been much, much steeper than anybody thought. And obviously, unlike any other recovery period, rate strength has way outperformed what anybody had thought. And when you look at it, you could look at the majority of our system, which we do, the majority of our system, the hotels are generating greater profitability than they ever have, greater than 2019, which was the prior high watermark. So, what is that -- what is happening? That is then fueling optimism. We'll talk about the US because you asked about the US, it's fueling optimism in people wanting to do more deals. This is -- we have a very diversified owner base. It's mostly small and medium businesses. This is what they do. It isn't a part of what they do. It's 100% for the most part of what they do, and they like what they see and they're making gobs of money in most of their hotels, and they want to do more of it, and they want to lock up the best brands to pat us on the back. We have the highest-performing brands in the business, the highest market share across on average and across each of the segments. And so we, I think, are disproportionately benefiting from that. And how it's showing up is, as Kevin, I think, mentioned in his prepared comments, we're going to be over 2019 levels on signings this year in the US. And that -- and a percentage of those are translating into starts, and that's why we have seen the uptick in starts starting in the third quarter that we think is going to continue in the fourth quarter. Now, there's a lot of uncertainty. I don't -- like how many different ways we can say it, and everybody is asking the question says it., So there's a lot of uncertainty out in the future, but we are seeing an inflection point. And we are certainly -- expect that to continue and are hopeful it continues for an extended period of time. While input costs are higher, the reality is those things are starting to stabilize a little bit. And you've seen other forms of construction drop off, which have provided more availability of subcontractors. And while the big banks are still -- it's still challenging from a lending point of view, our ownership community broadly is getting financed in local and regional banks, and they've still with the strongest relationships, been willing to finance. Now, they're putting more equity up, they're providing, in many cases, full recourse and rates are higher. But I think their view is rates are higher for a period of time. These are short-term financings that ultimately, when assets stabilize, will be in a different environment and longer they can convert to longer-term financing that's more reasonable. So, while it is clearly net-net harder, there are a lot of reasons. As I say, if you just look at the behavior of our broader owner community, they're signing more deals, and we've hit an inflection point on starts and we like seeing that. And we think our performance and market share and all of those things are meaningful contributors to it. And we'll keep you up to speed as we watch those tailwinds and headwinds in a macro environment to see if that changes, but we were -- we've been very pleased with that momentum. Let me sync up on stats because I think maybe I misheard you, or you misstated what I said when I gave group stats. So we're 5% up in the fourth quarter. By the way, if you go back a couple of quarters ago, we were not. We were 5% or 10% down. So again, the business has been picking up at a very rapid pace, but it is relatively short lead. We are 9% or 10% often group position system-wide for 2023, not ahead. But our tentatives and pipeline are literally off the charts. I mean, when we sit here and talk to our sales teams, across the world, the biggest issue is just having enough people to keep up with all the demand. There's a massive amount of demand, and it is short lead demand. So when we look into next year, just given the experience we've been having, it makes us feel very, very good about being able to fill in that group base and ultimately get group back, which was that 93% in the third quarter. We think it will be, from a revenue point of view, roughly at par in the fourth quarter. And we think given this trajectory, it will be above 19 high watermarks next year. Thus, another contributor like leisure, which we think will stay strong, and business transient, which we think is picking up steam and will stay strong, to why we think next year will be a reasonably a very good positive year. In terms of rates -- that is a good thing in the sense that we do, I think, have a reason -- if all these segments stay stable to strong, we have an ability to maintain pricing power that I think is, again, just back to the fundamentals of the business that, I think, is reasonably good. And we've been booking new business at much higher rates. You're right, existing business is booked at less high rates, although still reasonable rates.  Most of those are equal to or greater than 2019 rates. And at this point, the majority of our bookings for all of next year, I would say, are still to be booked. We're probably roughly half of our bookings, maybe plus or minus, are on the books at this point in the year and everything that's going on between now and the end of the year, we will go into next year higher than that, in my opinion, given the demand. But all of those bookings will be at the higher rate structure. So we think there's both the opportunity for the demand to get back and then exceed base demand levels of 2019 and to do it at a higher rate, which, for that segment, will contribute meaningfully to RevPAR growth. Just to think back to what it normally was, our system-wide group was about 20% of our business in 2019. Right now, it's about 16%, 17%. So we think next year will normalize and be pretty close to, if not, at historical levels of demand from a segmentation point of view. Morning. Best I remember, they both moved about 500 basis points in the quarter.\nQ \u2013 Patrick Scholes: Correct.\nA \u2013 Chris Nassetta: Up. Better. Better.\nQ \u2013 Patrick Scholes: Okay. And then do you have any -- I know it's early, but any indications on sort of the longer -- how are corporations feeling about 2024, 2025 at this point? I guess, it's fair to assume that they are probably a lot more cautious than they would be to book a holiday party at this point?\nA \u2013 Chris Nassetta: Yeah, I mean, that's not -- the business that gets booked that far out is typically the mega size groups. The association groups and other trade groups, and not so much -- I mean, corporations don't -- they don't book their small meetings or their social events. That's a relatively short cycle. But when you look at the big -- I think I mentioned -- I know I mentioned in my prepared comments, what we're seeing in terms of the mix on a forward-looking basis in bookings on the group side is looking a lot like the mix from pre-COVID, which by definition means we're getting a much bigger mix of the very large meetings and events that are getting booked. It's not surprising. It took some time to get there. And to get the revenue consumed, we'll take more time because these are huge multi-thousand person events, many of them citywide. They just take a long time to plan and implement. But that is definitely starting to happen as you talk to convention, visitor, CVBs around the country that is starting to happen. And it makes sense. Notwithstanding the macro concerns out there, a lot of these groups have to meet to survive. I mean, these are events that it's not just networking, these are revenue raising events that allow these trade groups and associations to be alive. And so they can only go so long in not doing these. And the reason they weren't doing them before was -- and by the way, they're generally very resilient in economic ups and downs, the big mega groups that book multiyears out, because there's too much planning and money involved. The reason that they uniquely during COVID were impacted was health. Like nobody -- if you're having an event that nobody shows up, well then we'll pay the registration fee and then you have a big expense of putting on the event, you not only don't make money, you can lose a lot of money. But now that we're sort of like -- I don't want to be the guy that declares that COVID is sort of over in the sense that it's not gone and there's variance, people aren't making decisions in terms of their behavior, both personally and professionally. And in meetings and events that are factoring for that, I think all of these groups now view it as it's a safe time from a health point of view to do it and they need to do it. And so they're very deep into the booking and planning processes. And so it sort of makes sense. The unique thing was the health issue this time, which we had to sort of get through. But I think at this point, notwithstanding things going on in COVID, I mean, just go into the airport, go into any one of our big hotels or anywhere else, and you can see that when these events are happening, they're very normal. It looks just like it did before.\nQ \u2013 Patrick Scholes: Okay. Chris, I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nA \u2013 Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I'll let Kevin answer. But competitively, we're probably not going to give you quite a detailed answer that you want. And -- no, I would say, that's right. And we don't stop. I mean, it's not a system. In the old days, these systems are like, build a new system and then you let it run for a long time. We're -- these algorithms are being tweaked constantly to add incremental data fields that used to be in revenue management in our world. It was really just like data related to the hotel. Now, we have data sets, because the world is awash in data that are contributing to the decision-making in these algorithms and just make it smarter. During COVID and the aftermath of COVID, one of the big things has not been less about floors and more about ceilings. And so, I think, we've been very thoughtful about that as well. So, yes, it's part of our -- one of the many things that we think we -- our commercial teams are second to none in the industry, not just in revenue management. But in every other regard, but this is one area that we think we do a really good job. Yes. Thanks, Stephen, good to have you on the call. I mean, not to be pedantic about it, but maybe I'll sound that way. It's just the loss of economics. I mean, I don't know how many times I got asked in the lead up to the pandemic. Why can't you get rate pressure? I'm not going to accuse you of it, but probably got asked a thousand times by you and everybody else. And my comment there is just, there was no compression. You were in an environment where, while supply wasn't high, it was over 30-year averages, and more importantly, demand was low, because you were in this very low work growth environment where GDP was vacillating between like 0% and 2%. And you put those -- you were an equilibrium. I mean, supply and demand, or maybe even a little bit at an equilibrium in the wrong way, and that doesn't give you pricing power. And no inflation. Now, you have all the things that allow you to have pricing power. You have very limited capacity for what will be an extended period of time, robust demand growth that we're talking about and broader inflationary pressures. And those things are different to the laws of economics. As they say around here, they're alive and well, and that's what's happening. They were driving the results prepandemic and they're driving this result just a different set of conditions. Sounds good. Thanks, everybody, for the time. As always, we appreciate the great questions and opportunity to give you a little bit of color on everything going on. Obviously, the macro environment is a little bit uncertain. And like you, we're watching it very carefully. But as you heard today, we remain really optimistic, certainly, about the long term of the business given the position that we're in from a brand strength and margin and overall enterprise-wide point of view. But we also remain optimistic in the short to medium term, just given that these tailwinds that we've talked about several times today are pretty strong. And we continue to see very good trends and very good recovery across all the segments. So we'll look forward after the end of the year to giving you a sense of the fourth quarter, and obviously, a little bit more visibility into how we think about 2023. Thanks again. Have a great day."

Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our second quarter results and discuss expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. As our second quarter results demonstrate, we have a lot to be proud of. System-wide RevPAR achieved 98% of 2019 peak levels with all major regions except for Asia-Pacific, exceeding 2019 RevPAR. We continued to execute on our strong development story reaching 7,000 hotels globally and grew our industry-leading RevPAR premiums, all while maintaining good cost discipline. Coupled with the resiliency of our asset-light fee-based business model, these accomplishments enabled us to deliver EBITDA 10% higher than the second quarter of 2019, with margins of nearly 70%, up more than 800 basis points above 2019 levels. As a result, we continued returning meaningful capital to shareholders after resuming our capital return program last quarter. Turning specifically to results, we reported RevPAR adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high-end of our guidance for the second quarter. System-wide RevPAR increased 54% year-over-year and was just 2% below 2019 levels, improving each month throughout the quarter with June RevPAR surpassing prior peaks. All segments improved quarter-over-quarter led by business transient and group. Leisure transient trends remained robust as consumer spending continued to shift from goods to services, particularly travel and entertainment. Weekend RevPAR was up approximately 14% compared to 2019 driven by robust rate gains. In June, weekend ADR was up 20% versus prior peaks. Business transient demand continued to improve throughout the quarter, driving weekday occupancy up 6 points from April to June, weekday RevPAR was 95% of 2019 levels, with ADR exceeding prior peaks. U.S. business transient RevPAR surpassed prior peak levels in June with demand improving across nearly all industries. On the group side, RevPAR in the quarter was roughly 85% of 2019 levels. Full year group position improved meaningfully throughout the quarter with strong forward bookings across all location types and nearly all major categories. Group mix is beginning to normalize with the percentage of company meetings increasing. Bookings for company meetings strengthened each month of the quarter, with tentative pipeline for the year, up materially versus 2019 boosted by high-teens rate increases. In the U.S., total group position is nearly at prior peak levels for the third quarter and exceeds prior peaks for the fourth quarter. With continued improvement in these segments and positive momentum across all regions, we remain optimistic for continued recovery throughout the balance of the year. As a result, we are raising our expectations for the full year to reflect the quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong results and better anticipated trends in the back half with RevPAR surpassing 2019 levels. For the full year, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA above 2019 and to generate the highest level of free cash flow in our history. We expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends or approximately 5% of our market cap at the midpoint. Turning to unit growth, we continue to drive a disproportionate share of global development, with nearly 1 in every 5 rooms under construction around the world slated to join our system. Additionally, our development market share is more than 3x larger than our existing share meaningfully higher than our peers given our industry leading RevPAR premiums. This is reflected in the more than 14,000 rooms we opened in the quarter. We signed more than 23,000 rooms bringing our development pipeline to a record 413,000 rooms. With nearly half of our pipeline under construction, we remain on track to deliver approximately 5% net unit growth for the year. According to Star, our year-to-date net additions are higher than all major branded competitors. Our conversion openings totaled more than 3,400 rooms in the quarter, representing roughly 24% of total openings. One of the most notable conversion openings in the quarter was the Waldorf Astoria Washington D.C. inspired by the legacy of the Old Post Office Building. The property brings Waldorf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s iconic history, stunning design and unforgettable experience experiences to our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital. Our disciplined development strategy continues to enhance our network effect, enabling us to serve more guests across more destinations for any stay occasion. During the second quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 2,800th Hampton hotel, 60,000 embassy rooms and several key luxury announcements, including the openings of Conrad properties in Nashville and Sardinia, and the signings of the Waldorf Astoria Sydney and Waldorf Astoria Kuala Lumpur. Earlier this month, we celebrated the highly anticipated opening of the Conrad Los Angeles, anchored within The Grand LA, the spectacular 305-room hotel marks the brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debut in California and makes LA the second U.S. city alongside Las Vegas to feature all three of our luxury brands. The openings of the Hilton Maldives Amingiri Resort & Spa and the Hilton Tulum Riviera Maya, an all-inclusive resort were two of the latest additions to our rapidly expanding portfolio of resort properties in prime beachfront destinations. With 400 unique hotels and resorts open and in the pipeline, our conversion-friendly brands, Curio and Tapestry, continue to provide an attractive value proposition for owners. By providing authentic and curated experiences and drawing inspiration from their local communities, these brands enable owners to retain their own unique identities while also benefiting from the power of our commercial engines. During the quarter, we opened the Royal Palm Galapagos marking the first international hotel brand in the Galapagos Islands and making Ecuador the 30th country in Curio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing portfolio. Tapestry opened its 10,000th room in the quarter, including the Hotel Marcel New Haven, which is anticipated to be the first net-zero hotel in the U.S. and one of less than a dozen LEED Platinum certified hotels in the country. All of these openings continue to expand the offerings available to our Hilton Honors members. In the quarter, Honors membership grew 17% to 139 million members and accounted for approximately 62% of occupancy, up 350 basis points year-over-year and roughly in line with 2019. To address the evolving needs of guests who want to travel with their pets, we have expanded our partnership with Mars Petcare to now include 7 of our brands, including all our focus service and All Suites Brands as well as Canopy. Through these expanded partnerships, guests will have access to virtual support from the Mars Pet expert team and have more than 4,600 pet friendly hotels to choose from. We continue to double down on the importance of the guest experience and their stay. Earlier this week, we launched our first ever global platform to focus on what has been missing from hotel advertising, the Stay. Hilton For the Stay places the hotel front and center. It goes without saying that our team members continue to be at the heart of that stay experience. I am extremely proud that earlier in the quarter, Hilton was inducted in DiversityInc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hall of Fame for our continued commitment to building an inclusive and welcoming environment. And now, I will turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the quarter and the expectations for the rest of the year.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 54.3% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. System-wide RevPAR was down 2.1% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength in leisure demand through the start of the summer travel season as well as stronger than expected recovery in business transient and group travel. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $679 million in the second quarter exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and up to 70% year-over-year. Outperformance was driven by better than expected fee growth, particularly across the Americas and EMEA regions. Management and franchise fees grew 54% driven by meaningful RevPAR improvement and strong Honors license fees. Cost control further benefited results. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items, was $1.29 exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and increasing 130% year-over-year. Turning to our regional performance, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 47% year-over-year and was up 1% versus 2019. Performance continued to be led by robust leisure trends and was further boosted by significant RevPAR recovery in business transient group, up 16 and 20 percentage points respectively from the first quarter. In the Americas outside of the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 140% year-over-year and was up nearly 5% versus 2019. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand, particularly at resort properties. In Europe, RevPAR grew 283% year-over-year and was up 1% versus 2019. Performance benefited from reduced travel restrictions and greater than expected international inbound arrivals. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 68% year-over-year and was up 4% versus 2019. The region continued to benefit from robust domestic leisure demand and strong international inbound travel, particularly from Europe. In the Asia-Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR was down 5% year-over-year and down 39% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 47% compared to 2019 as strict COVID policies and lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing continue to weigh on travel demand early in the quarter. Demand recovered quickly once restrictions eased, with occupancy in China recovering from 37% in April to approximately 60% in June, less than 6 points shy of 2019 levels. The rest of the Asia-Pacific region saw improvement as countries outside of China benefited from border reopenings. RevPAR for Asia-Pacific ex-China improved 12 percentage points throughout the second quarter, with April down 29% versus 2019 and June down 17%. We remain optimistic about continued recovery across the entire APAC region, including China as COVID-related policies continued to ease and additional countries opened their borders for international travel. Turning to development, our pipeline grew year-over-year and sequentially totaling over 413,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 60% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. While macroeconomic uncertainty and variability across regions persist, owner and development \u00e2\u0080\u0093 owner and developer interest remains healthy. The development community continues to preference our industry leading brands and strong commercial engines. For the full year, we still expect net unit growth of approximately 5% and signings to exceed 100,000 rooms. Moving to guidance, for the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 25% and 30% year-over-year year or up 1% to 5% compared to third quarter 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $660 million and $690 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.16 and $1.24. For full year 2022, we expect RevPAR growth between 37% and 43%. Relative to 2019, we expect RevPAR to be down 1% to 5%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, with margins for the full year more than 600 basis points higher than 2019 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA forecast represents a year-over-year increase of more than 50% at the midpoint and exceeds 2019 adjusted EBITDA. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $4.21 and $4.46. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $41 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $800 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our second quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak to all of you this morning. So, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question please?\nOperator: Thank you.  And our first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, Chris, Kevin, Jill, everyone. Chris, maybe this one is best for you. Just in terms of how you are thinking about the rest of the year? What is it that that you guys see here at the end of July? I am sure you have a pretty good look in August, but clearly, the September-October busier business travel season, group season, etcetera, what is it that you see in this period that kind of gives you the confidence in the guidance raise for the rest of the year and how do you kind of think about or feel when you look out to 2023?\nChris Nassetta: Carlo thanks for the question. That obviously is the prime question, I think on everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind. And I think it would be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it would be sort of best to start by saying, as everybody on this call knows that there is certainly a lot of uncertainty in the world. And I think we have to sort of be mindful of that as everybody has. I mean, we have been, as much as we see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on and we are watching the broader environment and lots of talk of slowdown and seeing it in certain industries. Certainly, I think predominantly industries that had reached high watermarks that were had favorable impacts from COVID, but nonetheless, starting to see slowdown. We have been looking very carefully at our business as you would guess that all the segments that sort of any forward-looking trends that we can see. And I would say, what we are seeing still is very positive. We see as Kevin and I both said in our prepared comments, continued strength in leisure, we expect to see that continue into the fall and higher rates than normal, I mean, lower rates than summer, like always, but higher rates than you would have typically seen pre-COVID, just because of increased leisure business, business transient continues to recover, led by recovery in the big corporates, which are not back to where they are, but they are back to sort of 80% of where they were. And the SMB side of the business that has been quite robust. I mean, in the second half of the year, based on the trends we have been seeing, our expectation is business transient is going to be sort of on a revenue basis equal to 2019 levels. And then when we think about the group side, while we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think in the second half, we will get all the way back to where we were \u00e2\u0080\u009819, we are going to get awfully close. And as I said, in my prepared comments, if we look at the booking position in third and fourth quarter, second half of the year, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over \u00e2\u0080\u009819 levels and our sales teams tell \u00e2\u0080\u0093 keep telling me, they can hardly keep up with the demand. Now, reality is, again, we are in an uncertain world. The booking windows are short. So our visibility is limited, certainly on transient business. We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really look too deeply into the fall on transient. Again, we can on the group side and those stats are good, but the current trajectory is good looking at July. June as we said was over \u00e2\u0080\u009819 levels. July is trending in a very good way and it will be over \u00e2\u0080\u009819 and improve over and above what we saw in June. So everything we are seeing sort of real-time, everything we have in terms of sightlines into the future, all feel pretty good, recognizing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there is a lot of macro uncertainty and recognizing that our booking windows and sightlines are not that far out, I think what is causing it like sort of as you see other industries sort of being impacted everyday, including today is a big reporting day, again, I think a lot of what you see coming, sort of going the wrong way are industries that were at crazy peaks, because they were huge beneficiaries, many of them of COVID and the pandemic, we were obviously not a big beneficiary. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fairly nice way of putting it. And our industry got hammered. And so what we are benefiting from, I think is sort of a handful of things. One, there is a lot of pent-up demand. We hear it all the time. I mean, while I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have tremendous sightlines in the sense of real transient booking data to give you, just because it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist, we talked to our customers all the time, not just the group customers, we are talking to all of our customers and we are in a regular dialogue with our SMBs, with the big corporates. And the anecdotal feedback that we are getting as we go into the fall is people have to travel more, more offices are open, more people are back in the office, while people are worried about where the macro environment is going. They have got to run the businesses. And in fact, the more worried they are, the more they realize they sort of got to get out there and make sure they are hustling. So, there is an element of pent-up demand. There is clearly and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to say I was right, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been right, there is clearly a massive shift in spending patterns right, away from goods into services. I said in my prepared comments, I have been saying since the beginning of the pandemic that the world is not going to go upside down that it may go upside down for a while, but it will normalize and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly what we are seeing. And so not only do you have pent-up demand, you just have new demand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming as people are sort of shifting their spending patterns. That means leisure business group, their people are shifting back to a more normalized lifestyle. Maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly the way it was, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like it was than it was. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like it was pre-COVID than it is during COVID. And so we are the beneficiary that you have. Infrastructure, people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about it. We passed a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package last year. Very little of that has been spent traditionally. You would start to see spending in the second, third and fourth year. So we are just sort of coming into the zone over the next 2 or 3 years on a $1 trillion of spending. I have said this so many times you guys are tired of hearing it. The highest R-squared correlation to demand growth in hotel rooms is NRFI, Non-Residential Fixed Investment, AKA Infrastructure. So I think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we think we feel good about sort of that being sort of underpinning broadly, Asia recovery, Kevin talked about it. Asia has been way behind. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not recovering as quickly as we would have thought, particularly China, but I do \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but it is recovering. And I think that provides some benefits, not just the rest of this year, but into next year. And then probably last but not least, if we look at our customers, certainly like our Honors base, which are driving the disproportionate share of our system-wide revenues. At the moment, they are still in pretty good shape. I mean, the median income of our higher end Honors members is significantly over $100,000 median income. And so, at the moment, they are still in pretty good shape and we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really yet seen any real cracks in the armor in terms of their spending pattern. So, I know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a filibuster of sorts, but I think it gives \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to answer the question, it gives you color, but as we sat in the very room, we are sitting in and thought about, how do we feel about the rest of this year? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we sort of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we came up with our forecast in our outlook. And as we think about next year, listen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be silly to say, I know, because nobody knows this. We are in pretty much uncharted waters as the smartest economist I talked to or saying the same thing. So I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. But I think a bunch of those things that I described are pretty good wind in our sails against what is obviously going to be a slowing U.S. and global economy, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what central banks are going to do. But we have some things that I think sort of our winds blowing the other way. And so I think as we get into the first half of next year, we are feeling like that, that is going to be helpful to us how we think the whole year will play out. Obviously, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premature for us to judge and when we get a little bit closer to it, we will have a little bit more precise view.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Chris, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very helpful. And then I want to be courteous to everyone on the call, but just quickly to clarify some of the comments from earlier, as you guys talked about, group and 4Q being greater or being up year-over-year, I should say, was that a revenue position comment you were making\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nChris Nassetta: Revenue, revenue, revenue\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nCarlo Santarelli: Could you talk about from an occupancy or occupied room night perspective, how group compares?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, I think system-wide second half of the year, we think it will be in the 90s. It will probably be 5 points off with the difference being made up in rate.\nCarlo Santarelli: Got it. Thank you, sir. Take care.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Sean Kelly from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSean Kelly: Hey, good morning, everyone. Chris, maybe just to dig in, I mean, obviously, you covered sort of most of the subjects in that last answer. So maybe to go slightly or deeper, if we just think about the acceleration between kind of what you are implying for the third quarter and what you actually saw in the second, what are some of the biggest, variances they are going to drive that things that come to mind are obviously international and then the continued improvement, you probably saw sequentially on business transient, but could you help unpack that a little bit?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, sorry, I did give a bit of a filibuster, but just wanted to give the whole thing context and not have it be chopped up. So, my apologies for answering what are probably a bunch of your questions, but I do think I sort of covered that. We certainly expect international travel to pick up. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to move the needle in necessarily in a huge way in the second half of the year. It really is what we described is what I already described, which is continuing strength and leisure, because weekend business we think is still going to remain strong, consumers still has desire and capacity to do it. They are traveling more from combination of the leisure business, of business in leisure. So we think that will mean leisure business will ultimately be at elevated levels relative to what we saw in pre-pandemic times. And we do think from a revenue point of view, business transient is on track largely because of the success we have had in SMB in the second half of the year, just on a revenue basis be back to 2019 levels. Now, that depends \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have all those bookings on that are confirmed at this point, but if you look again at June and July, you talk to the customers, look \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we look at detailed data on sort of how they are behaving right now. We feel good about that and group I covered. I mean, we think group will not recover to where we were in \u00e2\u0080\u009819. There is just not enough time, but we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to get awfully close. And we think there is a lot of momentum in the group side going into next year. So, I think, net-net, Sean, probably repeating myself, what it depends on is more of what we have been saying just grinding up on business. I mean, we are at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the whole quarter, we were at 95% on business transient. So we are getting awfully close in June in the U.S. We hit \u00e2\u0080\u009819 level. So it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the rest of the year. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what the rest of the year suggests is the strengthening and group based on our real position of group room nights on the books. And similar to what we have seen in June and July, in business transient and normal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 strength on weekends for leisure, but normal pattern of leisure backing off during the midweek as you go into the fall.\nSean Kelly: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question will come from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, everybody.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning, Jeff.\nJoe Greff: If you go back and you look at the last 2.5 years it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been remarkable that your same-store RevPAR growth rate and your management and franchise fee growth rate have mirrored each other almost to a one-to-one relationship. And over that timeframe, you have grown your room count north of 10%. The relationship between RevPAR growth and say fee growth or that sensitivity change going forward, where maybe there is if RevPAR were to experience a decline that sensitivity to the downside is maybe more favorable than what it would have been the last couple of years, just because of the growth in the room count?\nChris Nassetta: I think the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, I think the answer is yes. And what largely would drive it is what you are saying the non-RevPAR related fees are growing as a percentage of the fee base. And then the impact on the downside was accentuated because of the extremes. So in a normal like sort of normal recessionary environment, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see those sort of extreme impacts in terms of declines, RevPAR to EBITDA. So we think in a normal kind of environment, yes, it would be more one for one and we would get the benefit of the things that you described.\nJoe Greff: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from David Katz from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to just touch on the owned and leased portion of the model, which I think swung to positive. This quarter was a little earlier than what we anticipated. Can you just talk about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving that? Is there a strong business component to that and give us some help with the rest of the year and sort of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in there and how we might think about that?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, David. I think that we look first of all, I would say, yes, you are right, it did swing to a profit. We have been saying for a while that the growth rate would be more than the overall portfolio. In fact, that was the case when the numbers were still negative. It was in a weird way, it was still growing faster in improving the growth rate of the company. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all fundamentals though. I mean, if you look at where the portfolio was located in this particular quarter, the real strength regions were UK, particularly London and Central Europe. Japan, still a little bit further behind. So as APAC recovers, you have even a little bit more of a tailwind there from that part of the portfolio, but the RevPAR growth in the quarter was significantly ahead of even where I gave the Europe the EMEA \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I gave the Europe number in my prepared remarks. The RevPAR for this portfolio was even further ahead of that. And so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming from. And we expect those trends to continue again particularly as Japan is a little bit further behind on recovery. So, we expect going forward that, that portfolio. Well, remember, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a small part of the business. And over time, it will continue to be a smaller part of the business, but it will be a tailwind to our growth rate for a while as those regions recover.\nDavid Katz: Can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if I may, not to overstate my welcome, but should we perhaps look at the \u00e2\u0080\u009819 levels or any past levels of profitability and how might those guide us as we think about the future?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there is no reason why it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get back to or even exceed prior levels. You got to remember, the portfolio does get a little bit smaller over time. We exited 7 of those assets last year, 3 of which came into the system and shifted over to paying fees, but 4 of which went away altogether. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to make a huge difference on that. But I would \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so I would say keeping in mind that the portfolio continues to get smaller, I would say that recovering to where it was on a lag is a good way to think about it.\nDavid Katz: Excellent. Thanks.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: And the next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you just a little bit on the pipeline, you continue to see sequential growth in there and significant signings and it just seems a little bit kind of lot of crosscurrents going on keep hearing about developer challenges. And I am just wondering if you could speak to where you are seeing the growth, I know you have spoken about China, but how is it looking in the U.S. and what sort of challenges maybe your developers facing and is Hilton helping at all in terms of loans or anything of that sort?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, really good question. And yes, I mean, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on, essentially and let me just sort of everywhere, but China is that demand on the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from owners to sign new deals, has actually moved up pretty nicely. And you would say why with all the swirling winds and all the uncertainty? Well, I mean, look at, like they own assets and they are at, look at the results we are delivering and what we think we will deliver for the year and where we are relative to \u00e2\u0080\u009819. You think about margins, not our margins, but with all the changes we have made in the hotels. I mean, the reality is not every single \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in every single case, but in many, many cases, the hotels that our owners own are performing extraordinarily well, they are at high RevPARs with higher margins than they had pre-COVID. And so listen, this is what they do for a living, they are seeing great success, they are seeing tremendous flow-through they are seeing incredible rate in sort of pressure and that makes them want to do more of what they do. And so as Kevin said, we will sign \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to our peak in signings, but we will get \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are getting closer. We will get over 100,000 rooms. And again, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just positive. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s without China. China, actually, we will open more rooms in China this year, but we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sign as many simply, because there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the way they are addressing COVID with the lockdowns and the likes, have slowed development activity there. We have every confidence that when they reopen, it will pick up at a fast pace, but from a cultural point of view, they really \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get signings done when things are closed. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not the way things happen and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a little delayed. So, I think the reality is when you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the demand in the rest of the world, when you get that part of the engine firing as well, the numbers are going to feel pretty good and then it has to translate. And I think that will translate over time as sort of the world settles down a bit and people have a little bit more visibility on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on. But the demand is there market share, I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, we are not going to be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are out of the business of describing exactly what our market share is for a whole bunch of competitive reasons. But I will say, market share is up, again, in a meaningful way, significantly above 2019 levels significantly above where all our competitors are and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helping drive disproportionate interest, not only do people want to build more, but I think they want to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think they want to build more with us, because we are doing a better job in terms of driving share to help them drive profitability.\nSmedes Rose: Thanks. And let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just quickly you guys are announcing a new ad campaign with a different kind of focus, but I was just wondering I should know this, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not essentially supported by or funded by owners or is there corporate implications as well for that?\nChris Nassetta: That is funded by the system, which means essentially, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funded by owners. We have, I mean, the grossly simplified explanation is people will either pay us a management fee or franchise fee and then we have corporate expenses and then they pay system fees for a bunch of things marketing, technology, brand, essentially system charges and those that we manage, on a dollar \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on a not for profit basis, if you will, on their behalf. And all of the marketing dollars that we are talking about in our campaign come out of that. They are not corporate dollars. They are for the benefit of the system.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Yes. And the next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great, thanks. Just one follow-up on your comments on the demand from owners and kind of the record level of signings, some others in the industry have talked about getting record signings, but that construction starts have been matching the signings. And I know your rooms under construction currently are ahead of 2018, which is a great achievement. I am wondering if you are seeing though new rooms starts which would not impact your unit growth this year, but might have implications for \u00e2\u0080\u009823 or \u00e2\u0080\u009824, just kind of what you are seeing on the construction start front? Thanks.\nChris Nassetta: Yes, happy to answer that. And then Kevin can jump in if he wants to add anything. First of all, just to be clear, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say we are hitting records on signings, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say we are over 100,000. I think our peak was 116 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 115, 116, something like that. So we are getting closer and we are getting over 100 without as much help as we would like from China. On the start side, we do believe starts will go down again this year, given all of the things that are going on in the world with supply chain labor, financial markets, fears over the macro and recession, we think that they will have down. Having said that, our best estimates at this point, we have talked about this on prior calls is that we will probably have hit the floor in starts in the U.S. last year. We think we will be up modestly this year and probably hit the floor outside the U.S. this year. And our expectation is, given what I described before in terms of just where we are with RevPAR, where we are with margins, owner desire to do things that all things being equal, we are of the mind that next year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that this year would be the low point in starts and that they would start moving back up. And that puts us in a position to do as we have been expecting and suggesting we would do, which is for the next couple of years deliver in the mid-single digit.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up on the margin performance, up 600 basis points, I think that you have guided before that you would hold on to 400 basis points of that, do you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looking like you are at the higher end or maybe even above that at this point?\nChris Nassetta: We are doing better on margins, faster recovery, even better cost discipline that we assume. So, we are doing better on margins than we had suggested before.\nRobin Farley: In terms of holding on to that into 2023?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. And we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 actually, if you recall, we thought just because of the recovery in the real estate, we will get lower margins, it would help EBITDA growth, but it might just the arithmetic would hurt margins. And we had thought that we might sort of be flat or even a little bit down as we got through that this year. Obviously, with the guidance we gave you were 100 basis points, 150 basis points above what we did last year, which was meaningfully above \u00e2\u0080\u009819, which is getting us to the higher end of the 600 basis points. And we think we are going to be able to continue to drive margin growth from there.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I think last thing that Chris said is important in the sense that when we gave you that number that was sort of just helping people model sort of recovery and where it was going to go. It was not meant to be sort of a stopping point between the mix continuing to grow over time towards these non-RevPAR driven fees and cost control, we think margins will continue to grow over time.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. On average, if you just do the math and your model, my guess is it will be similar to ours. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 50 basis point to 100 basis point natural accretion in margin every year, just based on the business model.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just may be sort of I am picking it a bit too much here. But if I look at your sort of Q3 and then your full year RevPAR guidance and maybe some of your commentary, it looks to me you are sort of saying the Q3 is going to be better than Q2. And then maybe Q4 will be a slight pullback, that you are only expecting leisure demand sort of run through the full and obviously with group being stronger in Q4, are you expecting some elements maybe just to step back a little bit in Q4, or am I reading a little bit too much into your guidance?\nChris Nassetta: I think you are reading a little too much into it. But I think at this point, we sort of view the second half of the year, third quarter and fourth quarter in a very similar way. Obviously, the third quarter is a much, much bigger, more important quarter in the sense of all forms of travel. So, you have sort of seasonal things going on. But in terms of the basic breakdown of what we think in performance of the segments, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are not forecasting any difference any meaningful\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nRichard Clarke: Thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the last question. I think in the full year results, you specifically sort of guided, you are hoping for 66,000 construction starts this year. I think you gave a number in response to that. Is that still what you are looking to get to this year?\nKevin Jacobs: No, I think we had said that in the past and on prior calls. I think Chris said we expect starts to be down a little bit this year, there is a lot of year left. So, we are not sure exactly where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to play out, but probably be a little bit less than that.\nRichard Clarke: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. When you think about some of the restrictions with flight capacity that we hear about in the U.S. and in Europe not being able to keep up with consumer demand, do you believe any of this presents a risk to any parts of your recovery, or is it negligible and just more of kind of a soundbite for the airline industry?\nChris Nassetta: We have been watching that as you would guess really carefully and studying our data, along with the airline data and we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen any real impact. We just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find it. So, we feel pretty good about it. I mean talking to the not just listening, but I know most of the CEOs in the airline space and talking to them, I think they are making pretty darn good progress in terms of getting capacity back, getting the teams that they need in terms of pilots, flight attendants, maintenance crew, getting them trained. So, I mean it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not done by any means. But I think every day, it gets a little better. And so I think we feel like, we will be fine. I mean if you look at the patterns, like in the in the second quarter, I was actually surprised. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directional, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I am not going to tell you like we have perfect data on this. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty good directional, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consistent with what \u00e2\u0080\u0093the same way we would have analyzed it pre-COVID. In a normal world, like 60% of our business was fly-to and 40% of it was drive-to. In the second quarter, we think it was two-thirds drive-to, one-third fly-to. So, part of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on is people are with restricted capacities, they are just driving more, they are driving longer distances, but \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and they are staying in a tighter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they may be driving further, but they are not going cross country or whatever. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more regional and local business, but that works. So at the moment, while the airlines are sort of working their issues out, I think people are acting sort of accordingly in terms of how they are getting places. And we are not seeing any impact. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk to customers, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to impair the rest of the year.\nChad Beynon: Thanks Chris. Appreciate it.\nChris Nassetta: Yes.\nOperator: And the next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.\nVince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am curious how you are thinking about planning the business over the course of the next 12 months. It clearly sounds like the trend lines in corporate and group are getting better. Obviously, you believe leisure is continuing to fetch healthy ADRs and remain pretty stable at the high levels. As you think about like an efficient mix within those three buckets of demand, how are you approaching that and how are you handling pricing out the corporate and the group business as it comes back?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean the truth is, we are doing it with a lot of flexibility, because while we have a belief, which we have articulated in a bunch of different ways on this call, we know that we may not be perfectly right. So, as we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think proven during COVID, our teams, including our sales teams, our commercial teams are unbelievably quick on their feet. We retooled everything when we had to in COVID. We have retooled a dozen times through COVID as demand patterns have sort of been normalizing. So, I think what we will be set up for and then ready to pivot is a world that I described, which is a world that is getting reasonably close to pre-COVID normalization. I mean just like in Q2, by way of example, if you look at the segments compared to 2019, 55% \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in 2019, 55% of our overall system revenue came from business transient, 25% from leisure transient and 20% from group. If you look at the depths of COVID, it probably the most extreme times it went to like 35%, business, 55% leisure, and 10% group. In the second quarter, it was almost 50% business transient. It was like 34%, 35% leisure and 16% or 17% group. So as I have said before, we have sort of expected that as much as everybody wants to think everything is different. We sort of have been planning throughout and taking it in steps for a normalization to maybe not be exactly where we were pre-pandemic, but more looking like that than where we were, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. And so, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what will be set up for. But as I have said, the key here always is, flexibility and be prepared to pivot. On the margin, I do think we will continue to have higher levels of leisure than we had pre-pandemic. My guess is we will have potentially a surge in group just because of so much pent up demand as well. And so what are we doing, we are making sure we are staying super aggressive on leisure strategies, making sure that we are staying super aggressive on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with our group sales team, and they were all over every opportunity. And that we are focused on that. And then on the business transient side, while we love our big corporates, and we continue to work with them, we have had a lot of success with the SMBs. In the end, we think that when we normalize, we will have lower big corporates and higher SMB at a higher rate. And so we have deployed accordingly in our sales teams across the board to make sure that we are working those SMB accounts that we are covering a lot more of those in a very thoughtful way to continue to build that business. So, those will be at a high level, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of when we are sitting at this table talking about how we are going to deploy over the next 12 months, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we are thinking about it. But if the world pivots, we will pivot very quickly with it. But my guess is, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how the world is going to play out, little bit more leisure, a lot more group, a bunch more business transient and for us with a with a real focus on the SMBs.\nVince Ciepiel: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful high level color there. And maybe just a little bit more specifically, on that larger corporate, I would imagine a lot of that falls under the corporate negotiated rates. Can you remind us where those have been through COVID? Are they flattish with \u00e2\u0080\u009819 levels?\nChris Nassetta: They have been flat. They have been almost \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all of our large corporate clients during COVID agreed to keep rates flat to 2019 levels. And now in those negotiations, again, keeping it in perspective, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like 7% of the business right now, maybe 7% and a little bit of change. So, like, just keep that in perspective. But I think, what we are indicating is probably mid-single digit kind of increases for those accounts. And again, in a lot of hotels, the reason we want that even though SMB is maybe at higher rate is it provides a base of business, just like we put a basic group business on the books. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another way to put a base of business on. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it will be hotel-by-hotel, will be some hotels, and we will take any of it with some hotels, it will take some of it because they need the base. But I would suspect while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way early to judge, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of mid-single digit, the goals would be, to have dynamic pricing with all those accounts and that the end result will be somewhere in the mid-single digits. And that, when we are all said and done, it will be 6% or 7% \u00e2\u0080\u0093 6% to 8% of the business, where it used to be 10%.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning everyone.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: Kind of following up on that question on corporate rates, we are starting to get into negotiation season and I know, you are like, tell me, if you are going to see corporate rates up 50% next year, but how do you think about group and corporate rates increasing next year as it relates to negotiated rates? And as I keep that in mind with inflation next year, probably 20% higher than where it was in 2019.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to say and we are not here giving guidance on next year. There is a long way, if you are there and there is a lot of uncertainty in the world. But I mean probably the best, I gave you a little bit is said, although we are not in those negotiations in earnest yet with the big corporates where that would be. I think the way we would think about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the way we would think about unmanaged business transient business would be somewhere in the 5% to 10% range to keep pace with inflation. And I think we would think about the group, our group bookings the same way. In fact all the group bookings that like we were doing generally new group bookings that we did in the second quarter for \u00e2\u0080\u009823, we are in the high-single digit rate increases, I mean as the data point.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. And thoughts on Airbnb supply, certainly we are seeing in some of those really hot leisure markets, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vail, Aspen, Miami, a ton of Airbnb supply with everybody realizing how high the room rates are that they are going to rent out their units some, what sort of impact are you seeing, if any in those markets?\nChris Nassetta: None. Now, in some of those markets, we may not be in them. But as you can see kind of the numbers that we are posting at least what we are forecasting, what we are seeing in booking patterns, we are not seeing any impact. I mean I think what they do is they serve a certain customer need and we serve another customer need. I have said it for a long time, there is plenty of room for us to coexist given what we are delivering is very different. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally for different types of stay occasions. So, we are not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there is zero discernible impact from Airbnb side.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: And the next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks for the time. Maybe a short-term and a longer term, short-term, which international geographies surprised you the most in 2Q? And then longer term, how do you think about the pacing of China reopen 2023 and beyond, what is your planning assumption at this point?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I will offer an answer. Maybe Kevin will come over and offer a different one. But I would say Europe was the big surprise for me. Europe is on fire, huge surge in business. I mean the big cities, London, everything are raging this summer. In Q2 and they are raging in Q3. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been and Europe is now trending above \u00e2\u0080\u009819. I think for the full year, Europe will be not just for the second half, Europe was above in Q2. I think Europe will be ahead for the full year of 2019, in terms of RevPAR. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a pleasant surprise. And China, the honest answer is we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I would have thought, I mean we are making progress. Kevin gave the data points. I mean we have moved from in the 30s to 60. And I think we are probably above that now. You have things ebbing and flowing. I saw this morning they are locking down part of Wuhan, a million people. So, we are hopeful by the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I have been saying this, and I have been consistent by the time they have the party congress, which is in October, that they are at a different place. I think that is, as we talk to our teams there, I think there is a lot of belief that, as we get to the fall, things are going to normalize rapidly there. I do think it will be a while and what do I know for the record for anybody listening, I do think it will be a while before we have a ton of Chinese travelers traveling internationally or any of us going to China. I am hopeful that that would be next year. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been since 2000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the end of 2019 and I am dying to go. But the reality is, as we saw in the early recovery of COVID where they lead the world, when China opens up, China, in China, for China, just Chinese travelers moving around China, the business can boom in a very big way, because they are not leaving, they are staying and they love to travel within China and see the destinations there. So, I think as we get into October and the rest of the year, I would hope and I do think and our teams think that you are going to see a lot of activity in terms of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on and opening and travel within China. And I do think that will then start to restart in a big way the development engine that wants to go and people want to do, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been kind of hard to get it chugging again.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: As always, we appreciate you guys taking an hour out of your life to join us. We are obviously really pleased with the results in second quarter. We see the recovery, not just to happening, but happening at an even faster pace than we thought. We know the world has got a lot going on, but as I have said, bunch of different ways. As to Kevin, we feel quite good. We are cautiously optimistic. We feel quite good about the momentum we have and the wind we have in our sales through the rest of this year and into the first part of next year. And we look forward to giving you an update after we finish the third quarter. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Chris and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 54.3% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. System-wide RevPAR was down 2.1% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength in leisure demand through the start of the summer travel season as well as stronger than expected recovery in business transient and group travel. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $679 million in the second quarter exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and up to 70% year-over-year. Outperformance was driven by better than expected fee growth, particularly across the Americas and EMEA regions. Management and franchise fees grew 54% driven by meaningful RevPAR improvement and strong Honors license fees. Cost control further benefited results. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items, was $1.29 exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and increasing 130% year-over-year. Turning to our regional performance, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 47% year-over-year and was up 1% versus 2019. Performance continued to be led by robust leisure trends and was further boosted by significant RevPAR recovery in business transient group, up 16 and 20 percentage points respectively from the first quarter. In the Americas outside of the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 140% year-over-year and was up nearly 5% versus 2019. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand, particularly at resort properties. In Europe, RevPAR grew 283% year-over-year and was up 1% versus 2019. Performance benefited from reduced travel restrictions and greater than expected international inbound arrivals. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 68% year-over-year and was up 4% versus 2019. The region continued to benefit from robust domestic leisure demand and strong international inbound travel, particularly from Europe. In the Asia-Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR was down 5% year-over-year and down 39% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 47% compared to 2019 as strict COVID policies and lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing continue to weigh on travel demand early in the quarter. Demand recovered quickly once restrictions eased, with occupancy in China recovering from 37% in April to approximately 60% in June, less than 6 points shy of 2019 levels. The rest of the Asia-Pacific region saw improvement as countries outside of China benefited from border reopenings. RevPAR for Asia-Pacific ex-China improved 12 percentage points throughout the second quarter, with April down 29% versus 2019 and June down 17%. We remain optimistic about continued recovery across the entire APAC region, including China as COVID-related policies continued to ease and additional countries opened their borders for international travel. Turning to development, our pipeline grew year-over-year and sequentially totaling over 413,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 60% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. While macroeconomic uncertainty and variability across regions persist, owner and development a\u0302\u0080\u0093 owner and developer interest remains healthy. The development community continues to preference our industry leading brands and strong commercial engines. For the full year, we still expect net unit growth of approximately 5% and signings to exceed 100,000 rooms. Moving to guidance, for the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 25% and 30% year-over-year year or up 1% to 5% compared to third quarter 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $660 million and $690 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.16 and $1.24. For full year 2022, we expect RevPAR growth between 37% and 43%. Relative to 2019, we expect RevPAR to be down 1% to 5%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, with margins for the full year more than 600 basis points higher than 2019 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA forecast represents a year-over-year increase of more than 50% at the midpoint and exceeds 2019 adjusted EBITDA. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $4.21 and $4.46. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $41 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $800 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our second quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak to all of you this morning. So, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question please? Yes, David. I think that we look first of all, I would say, yes, you are right, it did swing to a profit. We have been saying for a while that the growth rate would be more than the overall portfolio. In fact, that was the case when the numbers were still negative. It was in a weird way, it was still growing faster in improving the growth rate of the company. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s all fundamentals though. I mean, if you look at where the portfolio was located in this particular quarter, the real strength regions were UK, particularly London and Central Europe. Japan, still a little bit further behind. So as APAC recovers, you have even a little bit more of a tailwind there from that part of the portfolio, but the RevPAR growth in the quarter was significantly ahead of even where I gave the Europe the EMEA a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I gave the Europe number in my prepared remarks. The RevPAR for this portfolio was even further ahead of that. And so thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s where ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s coming from. And we expect those trends to continue again particularly as Japan is a little bit further behind on recovery. So, we expect going forward that, that portfolio. Well, remember, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a small part of the business. And over time, it will continue to be a smaller part of the business, but it will be a tailwind to our growth rate for a while as those regions recover. Yes, I think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s there is no reason why it wona\u0302\u0080\u0099t get back to or even exceed prior levels. You got to remember, the portfolio does get a little bit smaller over time. We exited 7 of those assets last year, 3 of which came into the system and shifted over to paying fees, but 4 of which went away altogether. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s not going to make a huge difference on that. But I would a\u0302\u0080\u0093 so I would say keeping in mind that the portfolio continues to get smaller, I would say that recovering to where it was on a lag is a good way to think about it. Sure. Yes. I think last thing that Chris said is important in the sense that when we gave you that number that was sort of just helping people model sort of recovery and where it was going to go. It was not meant to be sort of a stopping point between the mix continuing to grow over time towards these non-RevPAR driven fees and cost control, we think margins will continue to grow over time. No, I think we had said that in the past and on prior calls. I think Chris said we expect starts to be down a little bit this year, there is a lot of year left. So, we are not sure exactly where ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to play out, but probably be a little bit less than that."

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. As our second quarter results demonstrate, we have a lot to be proud of. System-wide RevPAR achieved 98% of 2019 peak levels with all major regions except for Asia-Pacific, exceeding 2019 RevPAR. We continued to execute on our strong development story reaching 7,000 hotels globally and grew our industry-leading RevPAR premiums, all while maintaining good cost discipline. Coupled with the resiliency of our asset-light fee-based business model, these accomplishments enabled us to deliver EBITDA 10% higher than the second quarter of 2019, with margins of nearly 70%, up more than 800 basis points above 2019 levels. As a result, we continued returning meaningful capital to shareholders after resuming our capital return program last quarter. Turning specifically to results, we reported RevPAR adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high-end of our guidance for the second quarter. System-wide RevPAR increased 54% year-over-year and was just 2% below 2019 levels, improving each month throughout the quarter with June RevPAR surpassing prior peaks. All segments improved quarter-over-quarter led by business transient and group. Leisure transient trends remained robust as consumer spending continued to shift from goods to services, particularly travel and entertainment. Weekend RevPAR was up approximately 14% compared to 2019 driven by robust rate gains. In June, weekend ADR was up 20% versus prior peaks. Business transient demand continued to improve throughout the quarter, driving weekday occupancy up 6 points from April to June, weekday RevPAR was 95% of 2019 levels, with ADR exceeding prior peaks. U.S. business transient RevPAR surpassed prior peak levels in June with demand improving across nearly all industries. On the group side, RevPAR in the quarter was roughly 85% of 2019 levels. Full year group position improved meaningfully throughout the quarter with strong forward bookings across all location types and nearly all major categories. Group mix is beginning to normalize with the percentage of company meetings increasing. Bookings for company meetings strengthened each month of the quarter, with tentative pipeline for the year, up materially versus 2019 boosted by high-teens rate increases. In the U.S., total group position is nearly at prior peak levels for the third quarter and exceeds prior peaks for the fourth quarter. With continued improvement in these segments and positive momentum across all regions, we remain optimistic for continued recovery throughout the balance of the year. As a result, we are raising our expectations for the full year to reflect the quartera\u0302\u0080\u0099s strong results and better anticipated trends in the back half with RevPAR surpassing 2019 levels. For the full year, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA above 2019 and to generate the highest level of free cash flow in our history. We expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends or approximately 5% of our market cap at the midpoint. Turning to unit growth, we continue to drive a disproportionate share of global development, with nearly 1 in every 5 rooms under construction around the world slated to join our system. Additionally, our development market share is more than 3x larger than our existing share meaningfully higher than our peers given our industry leading RevPAR premiums. This is reflected in the more than 14,000 rooms we opened in the quarter. We signed more than 23,000 rooms bringing our development pipeline to a record 413,000 rooms. With nearly half of our pipeline under construction, we remain on track to deliver approximately 5% net unit growth for the year. According to Star, our year-to-date net additions are higher than all major branded competitors. Our conversion openings totaled more than 3,400 rooms in the quarter, representing roughly 24% of total openings. One of the most notable conversion openings in the quarter was the Waldorf Astoria Washington D.C. inspired by the legacy of the Old Post Office Building. The property brings Waldorfa\u0302\u0080\u0099s iconic history, stunning design and unforgettable experience experiences to our nationa\u0302\u0080\u0099s capital. Our disciplined development strategy continues to enhance our network effect, enabling us to serve more guests across more destinations for any stay occasion. During the second quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 2,800th Hampton hotel, 60,000 embassy rooms and several key luxury announcements, including the openings of Conrad properties in Nashville and Sardinia, and the signings of the Waldorf Astoria Sydney and Waldorf Astoria Kuala Lumpur. Earlier this month, we celebrated the highly anticipated opening of the Conrad Los Angeles, anchored within The Grand LA, the spectacular 305-room hotel marks the branda\u0302\u0080\u0099s debut in California and makes LA the second U.S. city alongside Las Vegas to feature all three of our luxury brands. The openings of the Hilton Maldives Amingiri Resort & Spa and the Hilton Tulum Riviera Maya, an all-inclusive resort were two of the latest additions to our rapidly expanding portfolio of resort properties in prime beachfront destinations. With 400 unique hotels and resorts open and in the pipeline, our conversion-friendly brands, Curio and Tapestry, continue to provide an attractive value proposition for owners. By providing authentic and curated experiences and drawing inspiration from their local communities, these brands enable owners to retain their own unique identities while also benefiting from the power of our commercial engines. During the quarter, we opened the Royal Palm Galapagos marking the first international hotel brand in the Galapagos Islands and making Ecuador the 30th country in Curioa\u0302\u0080\u0099s growing portfolio. Tapestry opened its 10,000th room in the quarter, including the Hotel Marcel New Haven, which is anticipated to be the first net-zero hotel in the U.S. and one of less than a dozen LEED Platinum certified hotels in the country. All of these openings continue to expand the offerings available to our Hilton Honors members. In the quarter, Honors membership grew 17% to 139 million members and accounted for approximately 62% of occupancy, up 350 basis points year-over-year and roughly in line with 2019. To address the evolving needs of guests who want to travel with their pets, we have expanded our partnership with Mars Petcare to now include 7 of our brands, including all our focus service and All Suites Brands as well as Canopy. Through these expanded partnerships, guests will have access to virtual support from the Mars Pet expert team and have more than 4,600 pet friendly hotels to choose from. We continue to double down on the importance of the guest experience and their stay. Earlier this week, we launched our first ever global platform to focus on what has been missing from hotel advertising, the Stay. Hilton For the Stay places the hotel front and center. It goes without saying that our team members continue to be at the heart of that stay experience. I am extremely proud that earlier in the quarter, Hilton was inducted in DiversityInc.a\u0302\u0080\u0099s Hall of Fame for our continued commitment to building an inclusive and welcoming environment. And now, I will turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the quarter and the expectations for the rest of the year. Carlo thanks for the question. That obviously is the prime question, I think on everybodya\u0302\u0080\u0099s mind. And I think it would be a\u0302\u0080\u0093 it would be sort of best to start by saying, as everybody on this call knows that there is certainly a lot of uncertainty in the world. And I think we have to sort of be mindful of that as everybody has. I mean, we have been, as much as we see whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going on and we are watching the broader environment and lots of talk of slowdown and seeing it in certain industries. Certainly, I think predominantly industries that had reached high watermarks that were had favorable impacts from COVID, but nonetheless, starting to see slowdown. We have been looking very carefully at our business as you would guess that all the segments that sort of any forward-looking trends that we can see. And I would say, what we are seeing still is very positive. We see as Kevin and I both said in our prepared comments, continued strength in leisure, we expect to see that continue into the fall and higher rates than normal, I mean, lower rates than summer, like always, but higher rates than you would have typically seen pre-COVID, just because of increased leisure business, business transient continues to recover, led by recovery in the big corporates, which are not back to where they are, but they are back to sort of 80% of where they were. And the SMB side of the business that has been quite robust. I mean, in the second half of the year, based on the trends we have been seeing, our expectation is business transient is going to be sort of on a revenue basis equal to 2019 levels. And then when we think about the group side, while we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think in the second half, we will get all the way back to where we were a\u0302\u0080\u009819, we are going to get awfully close. And as I said, in my prepared comments, if we look at the booking position in third and fourth quarter, second half of the year, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s over a\u0302\u0080\u009819 levels and our sales teams tell a\u0302\u0080\u0093 keep telling me, they can hardly keep up with the demand. Now, reality is, again, we are in an uncertain world. The booking windows are short. So our visibility is limited, certainly on transient business. We cana\u0302\u0080\u0099t really look too deeply into the fall on transient. Again, we can on the group side and those stats are good, but the current trajectory is good looking at July. June as we said was over a\u0302\u0080\u009819 levels. July is trending in a very good way and it will be over a\u0302\u0080\u009819 and improve over and above what we saw in June. So everything we are seeing sort of real-time, everything we have in terms of sightlines into the future, all feel pretty good, recognizing ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a\u0302\u0080\u0093 there is a lot of macro uncertainty and recognizing that our booking windows and sightlines are not that far out, I think what is causing it like sort of as you see other industries sort of being impacted everyday, including today is a big reporting day, again, I think a lot of what you see coming, sort of going the wrong way are industries that were at crazy peaks, because they were huge beneficiaries, many of them of COVID and the pandemic, we were obviously not a big beneficiary. I think thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a fairly nice way of putting it. And our industry got hammered. And so what we are benefiting from, I think is sort of a handful of things. One, there is a lot of pent-up demand. We hear it all the time. I mean, while I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have tremendous sightlines in the sense of real transient booking data to give you, just because it doesna\u0302\u0080\u0099t exist, we talked to our customers all the time, not just the group customers, we are talking to all of our customers and we are in a regular dialogue with our SMBs, with the big corporates. And the anecdotal feedback that we are getting as we go into the fall is people have to travel more, more offices are open, more people are back in the office, while people are worried about where the macro environment is going. They have got to run the businesses. And in fact, the more worried they are, the more they realize they sort of got to get out there and make sure they are hustling. So, there is an element of pent-up demand. There is clearly and Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m not going to say I was right, but Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been right, there is clearly a massive shift in spending patterns right, away from goods into services. I said in my prepared comments, I have been saying since the beginning of the pandemic that the world is not going to go upside down that it may go upside down for a while, but it will normalize and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s exactly what we are seeing. And so not only do you have pent-up demand, you just have new demand thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s coming as people are sort of shifting their spending patterns. That means leisure business group, their people are shifting back to a more normalized lifestyle. Maybe ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s not exactly the way it was, but ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s more like it was than it was. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s more like it was pre-COVID than it is during COVID. And so we are the beneficiary that you have. Infrastructure, people dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t talk about it. We passed a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package last year. Very little of that has been spent traditionally. You would start to see spending in the second, third and fourth year. So we are just sort of coming into the zone over the next 2 or 3 years on a $1 trillion of spending. I have said this so many times you guys are tired of hearing it. The highest R-squared correlation to demand growth in hotel rooms is NRFI, Non-Residential Fixed Investment, AKA Infrastructure. So I think a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we think we feel good about sort of that being sort of underpinning broadly, Asia recovery, Kevin talked about it. Asia has been way behind. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s not recovering as quickly as we would have thought, particularly China, but I do a\u0302\u0080\u0093 but it is recovering. And I think that provides some benefits, not just the rest of this year, but into next year. And then probably last but not least, if we look at our customers, certainly like our Honors base, which are driving the disproportionate share of our system-wide revenues. At the moment, they are still in pretty good shape. I mean, the median income of our higher end Honors members is significantly over $100,000 median income. And so, at the moment, they are still in pretty good shape and we havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t really yet seen any real cracks in the armor in terms of their spending pattern. So, I know thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a filibuster of sorts, but I think it gives a\u0302\u0080\u0093 to answer the question, it gives you color, but as we sat in the very room, we are sitting in and thought about, how do we feel about the rest of this year? Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s how we sort of a\u0302\u0080\u0093 thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s how we came up with our forecast in our outlook. And as we think about next year, listen Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d be silly to say, I know, because nobody knows this. We are in pretty much uncharted waters as the smartest economist I talked to or saying the same thing. So I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t know. But I think a bunch of those things that I described are pretty good wind in our sails against what is obviously going to be a slowing U.S. and global economy, because thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s what central banks are going to do. But we have some things that I think sort of our winds blowing the other way. And so I think as we get into the first half of next year, we are feeling like that, that is going to be helpful to us how we think the whole year will play out. Obviously, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s premature for us to judge and when we get a little bit closer to it, we will have a little bit more precise view. Revenue, revenue, revenuea\u0302\u0080\u00a6 Yes, I think system-wide second half of the year, we think it will be in the 90s. It will probably be 5 points off with the difference being made up in rate. Yes. Thank you. Yes. I mean, sorry, I did give a bit of a filibuster, but just wanted to give the whole thing context and not have it be chopped up. So, my apologies for answering what are probably a bunch of your questions, but I do think I sort of covered that. We certainly expect international travel to pick up. We dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to move the needle in necessarily in a huge way in the second half of the year. It really is what we described is what I already described, which is continuing strength and leisure, because weekend business we think is still going to remain strong, consumers still has desire and capacity to do it. They are traveling more from combination of the leisure business, of business in leisure. So we think that will mean leisure business will ultimately be at elevated levels relative to what we saw in pre-pandemic times. And we do think from a revenue point of view, business transient is on track largely because of the success we have had in SMB in the second half of the year, just on a revenue basis be back to 2019 levels. Now, that depends a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have all those bookings on that are confirmed at this point, but if you look again at June and July, you talk to the customers, look a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we look at detailed data on sort of how they are behaving right now. We feel good about that and group I covered. I mean, we think group will not recover to where we were in a\u0302\u0080\u009819. There is just not enough time, but we think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to get awfully close. And we think there is a lot of momentum in the group side going into next year. So, I think, net-net, Sean, probably repeating myself, what it depends on is more of what we have been saying just grinding up on business. I mean, we are at a\u0302\u0080\u0093 for the whole quarter, we were at 95% on business transient. So we are getting awfully close in June in the U.S. We hit a\u0302\u0080\u009819 level. So it doesna\u0302\u0080\u0099t a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the rest of the year. It doesna\u0302\u0080\u0099t a\u0302\u0080\u0093 ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s sort of a\u0302\u0080\u0093 it a\u0302\u0080\u0093 what the rest of the year suggests is the strengthening and group based on our real position of group room nights on the books. And similar to what we have seen in June and July, in business transient and normal a\u0302\u0080\u0093 strength on weekends for leisure, but normal pattern of leisure backing off during the midweek as you go into the fall. Good morning, Jeff. I think the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 well, I think the answer is yes. And what largely would drive it is what you are saying the non-RevPAR related fees are growing as a percentage of the fee base. And then the impact on the downside was accentuated because of the extremes. So in a normal like sort of normal recessionary environment, you dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t see those sort of extreme impacts in terms of declines, RevPAR to EBITDA. So we think in a normal kind of environment, yes, it would be more one for one and we would get the benefit of the things that you described. Yes, really good question. And yes, I mean, whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going on, essentially and let me just sort of everywhere, but China is that demand on the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 from owners to sign new deals, has actually moved up pretty nicely. And you would say why with all the swirling winds and all the uncertainty? Well, I mean, look at, like they own assets and they are at, look at the results we are delivering and what we think we will deliver for the year and where we are relative to a\u0302\u0080\u009819. You think about margins, not our margins, but with all the changes we have made in the hotels. I mean, the reality is not every single a\u0302\u0080\u0093 in every single case, but in many, many cases, the hotels that our owners own are performing extraordinarily well, they are at high RevPARs with higher margins than they had pre-COVID. And so listen, this is what they do for a living, they are seeing great success, they are seeing tremendous flow-through they are seeing incredible rate in sort of pressure and that makes them want to do more of what they do. And so as Kevin said, we will sign a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we wona\u0302\u0080\u0099t get to our peak in signings, but we will get a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we are getting closer. We will get over 100,000 rooms. And again, I think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s just positive. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s without China. China, actually, we will open more rooms in China this year, but we wona\u0302\u0080\u0099t sign as many simply, because there a\u0302\u0080\u0093 with the way they are addressing COVID with the lockdowns and the likes, have slowed development activity there. We have every confidence that when they reopen, it will pick up at a fast pace, but from a cultural point of view, they really a\u0302\u0080\u0093 you really dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t get signings done when things are closed. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s just not the way things happen and ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been a little delayed. So, I think the reality is when you a\u0302\u0080\u0093 with the demand in the rest of the world, when you get that part of the engine firing as well, the numbers are going to feel pretty good and then it has to translate. And I think that will translate over time as sort of the world settles down a bit and people have a little bit more visibility on whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going on. But the demand is there market share, I shouldna\u0302\u0080\u0099t, we are not going to be a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we are out of the business of describing exactly what our market share is for a whole bunch of competitive reasons. But I will say, market share is up, again, in a meaningful way, significantly above 2019 levels significantly above where all our competitors are and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s helping drive disproportionate interest, not only do people want to build more, but I think they want to a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I think they want to build more with us, because we are doing a better job in terms of driving share to help them drive profitability. That is funded by the system, which means essentially, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s funded by owners. We have, I mean, the grossly simplified explanation is people will either pay us a management fee or franchise fee and then we have corporate expenses and then they pay system fees for a bunch of things marketing, technology, brand, essentially system charges and those that we manage, on a dollar a\u0302\u0080\u0093 on a not for profit basis, if you will, on their behalf. And all of the marketing dollars that we are talking about in our campaign come out of that. They are not corporate dollars. They are for the benefit of the system. Yes, happy to answer that. And then Kevin can jump in if he wants to add anything. First of all, just to be clear, I didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t say we are hitting records on signings, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d say we are over 100,000. I think our peak was 116 a\u0302\u0080\u0093 115, 116, something like that. So we are getting closer and we are getting over 100 without as much help as we would like from China. On the start side, we do believe starts will go down again this year, given all of the things that are going on in the world with supply chain labor, financial markets, fears over the macro and recession, we think that they will have down. Having said that, our best estimates at this point, we have talked about this on prior calls is that we will probably have hit the floor in starts in the U.S. last year. We think we will be up modestly this year and probably hit the floor outside the U.S. this year. And our expectation is, given what I described before in terms of just where we are with RevPAR, where we are with margins, owner desire to do things that all things being equal, we are of the mind that next year a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that this year would be the low point in starts and that they would start moving back up. And that puts us in a position to do as we have been expecting and suggesting we would do, which is for the next couple of years deliver in the mid-single digit. We are doing better on margins, faster recovery, even better cost discipline that we assume. So, we are doing better on margins than we had suggested before. Yes. And we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 actually, if you recall, we thought just because of the recovery in the real estate, we will get lower margins, it would help EBITDA growth, but it might just the arithmetic would hurt margins. And we had thought that we might sort of be flat or even a little bit down as we got through that this year. Obviously, with the guidance we gave you were 100 basis points, 150 basis points above what we did last year, which was meaningfully above a\u0302\u0080\u009819, which is getting us to the higher end of the 600 basis points. And we think we are going to be able to continue to drive margin growth from there. Yes. On average, if you just do the math and your model, my guess is it will be similar to ours. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s 50 basis point to 100 basis point natural accretion in margin every year, just based on the business model. I think you are reading a little too much into it. But I think at this point, we sort of view the second half of the year, third quarter and fourth quarter in a very similar way. Obviously, the third quarter is a much, much bigger, more important quarter in the sense of all forms of travel. So, you have sort of seasonal things going on. But in terms of the basic breakdown of what we think in performance of the segments, we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we are not forecasting any difference any meaningfula\u0302\u0080\u00a6 We have been watching that as you would guess really carefully and studying our data, along with the airline data and we havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t seen any real impact. We just cana\u0302\u0080\u0099t find it. So, we feel pretty good about it. I mean talking to the not just listening, but I know most of the CEOs in the airline space and talking to them, I think they are making pretty darn good progress in terms of getting capacity back, getting the teams that they need in terms of pilots, flight attendants, maintenance crew, getting them trained. So, I mean ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s not done by any means. But I think every day, it gets a little better. And so I think we feel like, we will be fine. I mean if you look at the patterns, like in the in the second quarter, I was actually surprised. And ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s directional, I cana\u0302\u0080\u0099t a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I am not going to tell you like we have perfect data on this. But ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s pretty good directional, and ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s consistent with what a\u0302\u0080\u0093the same way we would have analyzed it pre-COVID. In a normal world, like 60% of our business was fly-to and 40% of it was drive-to. In the second quarter, we think it was two-thirds drive-to, one-third fly-to. So, part of whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going on is people are with restricted capacities, they are just driving more, they are driving longer distances, but a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and they are staying in a tighter a\u0302\u0080\u0093 they may be driving further, but they are not going cross country or whatever. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s more regional and local business, but that works. So at the moment, while the airlines are sort of working their issues out, I think people are acting sort of accordingly in terms of how they are getting places. And we are not seeing any impact. We dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t talk to customers, we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think that ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to impair the rest of the year. Yes. Yes. I mean the truth is, we are doing it with a lot of flexibility, because while we have a belief, which we have articulated in a bunch of different ways on this call, we know that we may not be perfectly right. So, as we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I think proven during COVID, our teams, including our sales teams, our commercial teams are unbelievably quick on their feet. We retooled everything when we had to in COVID. We have retooled a dozen times through COVID as demand patterns have sort of been normalizing. So, I think what we will be set up for and then ready to pivot is a world that I described, which is a world that is getting reasonably close to pre-COVID normalization. I mean just like in Q2, by way of example, if you look at the segments compared to 2019, 55% a\u0302\u0080\u0093 in 2019, 55% of our overall system revenue came from business transient, 25% from leisure transient and 20% from group. If you look at the depths of COVID, it probably the most extreme times it went to like 35%, business, 55% leisure, and 10% group. In the second quarter, it was almost 50% business transient. It was like 34%, 35% leisure and 16% or 17% group. So as I have said before, we have sort of expected that as much as everybody wants to think everything is different. We sort of have been planning throughout and taking it in steps for a normalization to maybe not be exactly where we were pre-pandemic, but more looking like that than where we were, and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s happening. And so, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s what will be set up for. But as I have said, the key here always is, flexibility and be prepared to pivot. On the margin, I do think we will continue to have higher levels of leisure than we had pre-pandemic. My guess is we will have potentially a surge in group just because of so much pent up demand as well. And so what are we doing, we are making sure we are staying super aggressive on leisure strategies, making sure that we are staying super aggressive on a\u0302\u0080\u0093 with our group sales team, and they were all over every opportunity. And that we are focused on that. And then on the business transient side, while we love our big corporates, and we continue to work with them, we have had a lot of success with the SMBs. In the end, we think that when we normalize, we will have lower big corporates and higher SMB at a higher rate. And so we have deployed accordingly in our sales teams across the board to make sure that we are working those SMB accounts that we are covering a lot more of those in a very thoughtful way to continue to build that business. So, those will be at a high level, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s sort of when we are sitting at this table talking about how we are going to deploy over the next 12 months, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s how we are thinking about it. But if the world pivots, we will pivot very quickly with it. But my guess is, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s how the world is going to play out, little bit more leisure, a lot more group, a bunch more business transient and for us with a with a real focus on the SMBs. They have been flat. They have been almost a\u0302\u0080\u0093 all of our large corporate clients during COVID agreed to keep rates flat to 2019 levels. And now in those negotiations, again, keeping it in perspective, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s like 7% of the business right now, maybe 7% and a little bit of change. So, like, just keep that in perspective. But I think, what we are indicating is probably mid-single digit kind of increases for those accounts. And again, in a lot of hotels, the reason we want that even though SMB is maybe at higher rate is it provides a base of business, just like we put a basic group business on the books. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s another way to put a base of business on. So, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s hotel a\u0302\u0080\u0093 it will be hotel-by-hotel, will be some hotels, and we will take any of it with some hotels, it will take some of it because they need the base. But I would suspect while ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s way early to judge, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s sort of mid-single digit, the goals would be, to have dynamic pricing with all those accounts and that the end result will be somewhere in the mid-single digits. And that, when we are all said and done, it will be 6% or 7% a\u0302\u0080\u0093 6% to 8% of the business, where it used to be 10%. Good morning. Yes. I mean a\u0302\u0080\u0093 ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s hard to say and we are not here giving guidance on next year. There is a long way, if you are there and there is a lot of uncertainty in the world. But I mean probably the best, I gave you a little bit is said, although we are not in those negotiations in earnest yet with the big corporates where that would be. I think the way we would think about a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the way we would think about unmanaged business transient business would be somewhere in the 5% to 10% range to keep pace with inflation. And I think we would think about the group, our group bookings the same way. In fact all the group bookings that like we were doing generally new group bookings that we did in the second quarter for a\u0302\u0080\u009823, we are in the high-single digit rate increases, I mean as the data point. None. Now, in some of those markets, we may not be in them. But as you can see kind of the numbers that we are posting at least what we are forecasting, what we are seeing in booking patterns, we are not seeing any impact. I mean I think what they do is they serve a certain customer need and we serve another customer need. I have said it for a long time, there is plenty of room for us to coexist given what we are delivering is very different. And ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s generally for different types of stay occasions. So, we are not a\u0302\u0080\u0093 there is zero discernible impact from Airbnb side. Yes. I will offer an answer. Maybe Kevin will come over and offer a different one. But I would say Europe was the big surprise for me. Europe is on fire, huge surge in business. I mean the big cities, London, everything are raging this summer. In Q2 and they are raging in Q3. So, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s been and Europe is now trending above a\u0302\u0080\u009819. I think for the full year, Europe will be not just for the second half, Europe was above in Q2. I think Europe will be ahead for the full year of 2019, in terms of RevPAR. So, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s been a pleasant surprise. And China, the honest answer is we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t know. I would have thought, I mean we are making progress. Kevin gave the data points. I mean we have moved from in the 30s to 60. And I think we are probably above that now. You have things ebbing and flowing. I saw this morning they are locking down part of Wuhan, a million people. So, we are hopeful by the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and I have been saying this, and I have been consistent by the time they have the party congress, which is in October, that they are at a different place. I think that is, as we talk to our teams there, I think there is a lot of belief that, as we get to the fall, things are going to normalize rapidly there. I do think it will be a while and what do I know for the record for anybody listening, I do think it will be a while before we have a ton of Chinese travelers traveling internationally or any of us going to China. I am hopeful that that would be next year. I havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t been since 2000 a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the end of 2019 and I am dying to go. But the reality is, as we saw in the early recovery of COVID where they lead the world, when China opens up, China, in China, for China, just Chinese travelers moving around China, the business can boom in a very big way, because they are not leaving, they are staying and they love to travel within China and see the destinations there. So, I think as we get into October and the rest of the year, I would hope and I do think and our teams think that you are going to see a lot of activity in terms of whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going on and opening and travel within China. And I do think that will then start to restart in a big way the development engine that wants to go and people want to do, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s just, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been kind of hard to get it chugging again. As always, we appreciate you guys taking an hour out of your life to join us. We are obviously really pleased with the results in second quarter. We see the recovery, not just to happening, but happening at an even faster pace than we thought. We know the world has got a lot going on, but as I have said, bunch of different ways. As to Kevin, we feel quite good. We are cautiously optimistic. We feel quite good about the momentum we have and the wind we have in our sales through the rest of this year and into the first part of next year. And we look forward to giving you an update after we finish the third quarter. Thanks and have a great day."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.\nJill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.  Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements.

This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our first quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a minute to express our sadness at the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine. Our hotels have always been a part of the fabric of the communities we serve, and we take our promise to make those communities better places to live and work very seriously. Along with the steps we've taken to protect our team members and guests, we've also partnered with American Express and our ownership community to donate up to 1 million room nights across Europe to support Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian relief efforts. Additionally, the Hilton Global Foundation has contributed to World Central Kitchen and Project Hope to further assist with the humanitarian aid. We are keeping our Hilton family and everyone impacted by these horrific events in our thoughts and hope for a peaceful resolution to this crisis. Our Hilton values and purpose-led culture have led us through uncertainty as well as recovery. Our team members around the world have worked hard to effectively navigate the challenges over the last 2 years, and as a result, have positioned Hilton even stronger for the future. As we look to the year ahead, we are optimistic that our industry-leading RevPAR premiums and fee-based capital-light business model, coupled with further demand recovery, will continue to drive strong performance and meaningful free cash flow, which will enable us to return significant capital to shareholders in a disciplined way. With recent performance exceeding our expectation, we were pleased to have resumed our Capital Return Program earlier than anticipated, beginning share repurchases in March. Through April, we had completed approximately $265 million of buybacks. Additionally, we have declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, further highlighting the confidence in continued recovery and the strength of our model. For the year, we expect to return $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Turning to results in the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased more than 80% year-over-year, driving adjusted EBITDA up 126%. RevPAR was approximately 83% of 2019 levels with adjusted EBITDA at 90%. Despite a choppy start to the year given Omicron related demand pressures, trends picked up meaningfully month-over-month with RevPAR declines versus 2019 improving approximately 17 percentage points from January to March, down only 9% to 2019, driven by acceleration across all segments. In March, system-wide rates were up 3% compared to 2019. Strong leisure transient trends continued to boost weekend performance with RevPAR in the quarter exceeding 2019 levels and rates up approximately 9% versus prior peaks, acceleration in business transient and group trends drove meaningful improvement midweek. U.S. business transient RevPAR increased sequentially versus the fourth quarter, with March down only 9% compared to 2019 levels. Improving trends from large accounts, along with continued strength from SMEs results. In March, revenue from large accounts was just 12% below 2019. Overall business transient now comprises 45% of total segment mix just 10-point shy of prepandemic levels. For April, overall U.S. transient booked revenue for all future periods was up 17% versus 2019 levels, with rates up 10% and room nights up 7%. Weekday booked revenue was up 9% compared to 2019 and weekend booked revenue was up 38%, driven largely by strong rate gains. On the group side, social and smaller events continue to lead recovery, while demand for company meetings and conventions improved meaningfully throughout the quarter. In March, total group RevPAR was more than 75% of 2019 levels, improving approximately 25 points versus January. Additionally, group revenue booked in the first quarter for all future periods was down just 4% relative to 2019 levels, and total lead volume for all future periods was up 3.5%. Compared to 2019, our tentative booking revenue is up significantly with rate gains for company meetings up more than 13%. Additionally, rates on new group bookings for in-year arrivals are strong, up in the high single digits versus 2019. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain optimistic. Positive momentum has continued into the second quarter with April RevPAR tracking at roughly 95% of 2019 levels. While macro risks and uncertainty exists, forecast for economic growth remain healthy. Additionally, our ability to reprice rooms in real time creates a natural inflation hedge. We think there is a good likelihood that we'll reach 2019 system-wide RevPAR levels during the third quarter.  For the full year, we expect leisure RevPAR to exceed 2019 peak levels given excess consumer savings, a strong job market and pent-up demand. We expect business transient to be roughly back to 2019 levels by year-end, with expectations supported by rising corporate profits, rebounding demand from big businesses, and loosening travel restrictions. On the group side, we expect RevPAR to be at approximately 90% of 2019 levels by year-end, as demand for company meetings and convention business accelerates into the back half of the year. On the development front, our leading RevPAR index premiums and powerful commercial engines continued to drive out performance. In the quarter, we added more than 13,000 rooms and achieved 5% net unit growth. We continue to deliver on our commitment to discipline and strategic growth, celebrating important milestones across segments and geographies. We opened our 500th Homewood in the U.S., our 50th Hilton Garden Inn in Asia Pacific and debuted our largest hotel in the Asia Pacific region with the opening of the 1,080 room Hilton Singapore Orchard. With a contemporary design, innovative dining experiences and extensive meeting space, the property is a fantastic representation of our flagship brand and puts us in an even stronger position in Asia to usher in a new era of travel. Building on last quarter's momentum, we also continued expanding our lifestyle portfolio with the openings of the Canopy Boston Downtown and the Canopy New Orleans. Even with strong openings, we grew our pipeline to more than 410,000 rooms up year-over-year and versus the fourth quarter. We continue to lead the industry in new development signings with Home2 Suites surpassing all other competitor brands globally. We demonstrated our commitment to further expand our luxury and lifestyle portfolios in the world's most sought-after destinations with the signing of the Waldorf Astoria Sydney, the Conrad Austin Hotel & Residences, and Canopy Properties in Cannes and Downtown Nashville. We look forward to delivering world-class service and unforgettable experiences in these exciting destinations. Conversion signings in the quarter were up 15% year-over-year and represented nearly 20% of overall signings. In recent months, we signed agreements to bring our conversion-friendly brands, Curio and Tapestry to exciting destinations like the Galapagos Islands, San Sebastian Spain, Maui and Sonoma County, California. DoubleTree has continued to lead the way for European upscale growth with new conversion properties across France, Germany and the Netherlands. While rising costs are pressuring construction starts, we are on track to deliver 5% net unit growth for the year and remain confident in our ability to return to a 6% to 7% growth rate over the next few years. Reliable and friendly service are at the heart of our promise to our guests and we continue to leverage our direct channels to offer them even more personalized experiences. Direct bookings continued to grow in the quarter that represent roughly 75% of our total bookings led by growth in Digital Direct. OTA mix continued to decline and is approaching pre-pandemic levels as increases in business transient and group demand shifted customer mix. In the quarter, Hilton Honors membership grew 15% to more than 133 million members. Honors members accounted for 60% of occupancy, flat versus the first quarter of 2019. And average nights per member were up 11% year-over-year as engagement continued to grow.  As we continue recovering from the impacts of the pandemic, I am inspired every day by the dedication of our team members as we welcome more guests back to our hotels. It's because of them and our culture of hospitality, that we continue to be recognized as a Great Place To Work. In fact, Hilton was recently named the #2 best company to work for in the United States by Fortune and Great Place to Work, something I'm truly proud of. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on our results in the quarter and our expectations for the year ahead. Kevin?\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 80.5% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. System-wide RevPAR was down 17% compared to 2019, impacted by the Omicron variant. Following a seasonally slow start to the year, demand picked up across all segments and regions in March, driven by continued strength in leisure demand and loosening corporate travel restrictions. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $448 million in the first quarter. Results reflect the continued recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 79%, driven by meaningful RevPAR improvement and strong Honors license fees. Continued cost control further benefited results. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the more challenging operating environment, particularly at the start of the year in Europe and Japan, where the portfolio is concentrated. Fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties also pressured results. However, performance improved throughout the quarter, driven by strengthening demand across Europe in March. Rebounding fundamentals, coupled with cost discipline should continue to drive significant growth in operating performance going forward. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.71. Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 77% year-over-year and was down 13% versus 2019. While the Omicron variant weighed on demand at the beginning of the year, RevPAR improved 17 percentage points over the course of the quarter, which marks down less than 6% versus 2019. Leisure travel continued to lead the recovery with segment RevPAR exceeding 2019 levels for the quarter. Upticks in business transient and group travel, particularly in March, also contributed to solid performance in the quarter. In the Americas outside of the U.S., first quarter RevPAR increased 137% year-over-year and was down 17% versus 2019. The Omicron variant suppressed demand in January and February, but rebounded in March led by strong leisure demand, particularly at resort properties during the spring break season.  In Europe, RevPAR grew 349% year-over-year and was down 30% to 2019. Travel demand accelerated following the Omicron outbreak with March RevPAR down 13% compared to 2019. The region benefited from easing travel restrictions and an increase in cross-border travel. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 121% year-over-year and was up 8% versus 2019. Performance continued to benefit from strong domestic leisure demand and greater international inbound travel as travel restrictions across Europe loosened.  In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR grew 11% year-over-year and was down 47% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 45% compared to 2019, as travel restrictions and reimposed lockdown suppressed demand. The rest of the Asia Pacific region saw modest improvement in demand recovery as more countries loosen border and arrival controls in March.  Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the first quarter, we grew net units 5%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling over 410,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 60% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. We continue to see robust demand for Hilton-branded properties, demonstrating owner and developer confidence in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands. For the full year, we expect signings to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit range year-over-year, and we expect net unit growth of approximately 5%. Moving to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 45% and 50% year-over-year or down 5% to 10% compared to second quarter 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $590 million and $610 million, and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, to be between $0.98 and $1.03. For the full year 2022, we expect RevPAR growth between 32% and 38%. Relative to 2019, we expect RevPAR growth to be down 5% to 9%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 40% at the midpoint, and essentially recovered to peak 2019 adjusted EBITDA. We forecast diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of between $3.77 and $4.02. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. As Chris mentioned, we reinstated our share repurchase program in March, which had been suspended during the pandemic. Year-to-date through April, we completed approximately $265 million in buybacks and our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, based on our adjusted EBITDA forecast and assuming the high end of our target leverage range of 3 to 3.5x. After demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business model during the pandemic, we continue to evaluate the possibility of a modestly higher target leverage range in the future. Overall, we are proud of how we navigated the pandemic and remain confident in our ability to continue generating substantial free cash flow and delivering meaningful shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?\nOperator: . And the first question will be from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.\nJoseph Greff: Chris, how much of your second quarter and full year RevPAR guidance is occupancy-driven versus rate driven? How does moderating growth in leisure volumes, just given the tough comparisons and relatively higher growth in business transient group volumes, impact the blend of ADR and ADR growth in the second half?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean, we gave a lot of commentary on rate growth in the sense of giving you as much visibility as we had to represent the strength that we're seeing. I mean, we're wonderful, as I said in my prepared comments, inflation hedge because we can reprice every minute of every day. And as demand has picked up, we have certainly been able to do that, and we expect that we will continue to be able to do that. I think as the year goes on, we expect the largest part of RevPAR growth to come from rate growth. We obviously expect to see occupancy growth as well. But I think net-net, it will be majority driven by rate. In terms of the segments, leisure, broadly remains quite strong. I mean, right now, I think the number is consumers still have $2.5 trillion of excess savings that they accumulated during the pandemic in their pockets. While people have been out traveling a lot more than they had maybe a year ago, there's still a lot of people that haven't and a lot of people that really want to get out and have experiences. And so people that we have pretty full employment. People have a lot of money in their bank accounts. And I think now feel quite safe broadly, certainly here in the U.S., not everywhere in the world. Obviously, the world is a big place, but in the Western world feel safe going out. And so we expect to see very strong leisure continue. I mean we think we'll probably have the biggest leisure summer we've ever had, only to surpass last summer, which was the biggest leisure summer we had ever seen, prior to what I think we'll see this summer. And then as we get into the fall and as people go -- are back more in the office, which we certainly are seeing now and expect to see more of, we're seeing, as I articulated and Kevin did as well, we're seeing a very nice uptick in return to business transient and return on the group side.  The group side lags a little bit as we know. There's more planning involved in that, but we think the second half of the year is going to get stronger and stronger. And business transient, even over the last couple of months, we've seen pick up. And notably, and something I commented on in my prepared remarks, we've even seen the large corporates start to come back, where March was only 12% down. And April, you can assume was better. We don't have all the data on the breakdown in April, but certainly broadly, business transient was even better in April. So businesses have a lot of pent-up demand, needs for travel. Balance sheets are very, very strong. Profits are very strong. Liquidity is very, very strong. And so I think the combination of that, with what's going on with the consumer, and then sort of the icing on the cake is the group side, where there's just so much new demand, but then pent-up demand, all of which I think will start to converge here in the second half of this year and into next year. I think puts us in a place where we feel really good about the short to intermediate term, and both the demand side, but particularly the rate side. And again, the reason I gave, the stats I did about forward-looking booking trends on the transient side, which obviously only is so far out. But on the Group side, was that we really are seeing the ability to drive pricing power like a lot of industries are, but certainly makes us -- gives us the optimism that has led to our judgments on both giving guidance, but also on our return to capital program and the like.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: Chris, you talked a little bit about kind of business transient back at 45% versus, I believe, that was probably closer to 55% prepandemic. And obviously, Group is probably a couple of hundred below its normal mix. As that stuff comes back and you think about maybe a full year 2023 and occupancy in general, what kind of pricing power do you think you have at occupancy levels that are kind of commensurate with 2019 levels, which I believe were kind of $143, $143-ish?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Well, let me -- first, in terms of the mix, it's probably worth stating because I commented a teeny bit in my prepared comments. You're right, business transit sort of the mix pre-COVID was plus or minus 55 business transient, 25 leisure transient and 20 group. If you look at, sort of what I would sort of call, the bottom of the recession driven by the pandemic, it went to 35 business transient, 55 leisure and 10 group. Now it's 45 business transient, 39 leisure and 16 group.  And I've been saying this so pretty much for 2 years. In the beginning, people maybe thought it was crazy, but that when we wake up and this sort of flushes through the system and we get fully on the other side of it, that business mix is going to look an awful lot like it did pre-COVID. And I think we're on our way to that. And so I think when we look -- maybe not , I think leisure transient will probably remain elevated for a while. But I think it will -- it is regressing to the mean, and it will look more like it did than like it has looked, in '23 and certainly in '24.  In terms of broader pricing pressures, as all that comes back, not to be pedantic about it, but it's sort of the laws of supply and demand, economics, which is, if we have a product that's in high demand and increasing demand, and there's not a lot more -- there's not enough supply and not a lot is being added, which is sort of the case in terms of what's going on with all of our segments increasingly so in midweek and that's only going to increase and then you compound that with getting a decent group base starting in the second half of the year and the next year, I think we'll have meaningful pricing power next year, just because the laws of supply and demand suggest we should. And I think they're alive and well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Not to probably overly dig into this, but Chris, I think in the prepared comments, you mentioned that April was running down only about 5%. That's obviously already kind of at the top end of the guidance you provided for the second quarter. So I think we all get that the background sounds pretty optimistic. But could you just help us kind of reconcile that? And maybe just some of the puts and takes around what it would take for things to be better than -- a little bit better than maybe what you've laid out in the guidance and/or what factors might have led you to be a little bit more conservative?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Well, I mean, the guidance we gave is the guidance we gave. First of all -- I mean I think, Shaun, there are -- it's a good question. I think there are some comp issues in certain months. But honestly, if you listen -- if you replay what I just said in response to Carlo's question, we believe that we're going to continue to see a very strong leisure demand base and an increasingly strong leisure -- business transient and group base as we march through the next few quarters of this year and into next year. So we're not trying to signal in our guidance that we think there's something going on from a weakening point of view. We think things are strengthening.\nShaun Kelley: Sorry to split hairs there. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, probably for Kevin. But could you just talk a little bit about -- obviously, the capital return guidance is super encouraging. Does that have you holding a specific leverage target? Or you've mentioned a couple of times in the past about possibly revisiting what that target would be, but what sort of implied in the $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion that we're getting here, and does that leave you a little bit of room to go even higher still, should you reevaluate it?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Shaun. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks that may have been a little garbled, but it implies that high end of the range, it implies 3.5x. So embedded in that, yes, we've said and I said it in my prepared remarks that we continue to think about potentially increasing leverage modestly over time. We think the balance sheet is shown that it can handle a higher level of leverage and the business can handle a higher level of leverage given what we just went through.  And -- but there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. And so we're starting with effectively 0.25x increase at the midpoint by saying we're at the high end of the range, and we'll take it from there.\nOperator: And the next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: Just a couple of follow-up questions on growth. What's your level of confidence in the 5% guide this year? Any updated thoughts on timing or gain back to 6% to 7%? And just how are developments in China going?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. No problem. Look, we -- we're giving you the guidance. So we're highly confident that we can achieve it. Obviously, a lot of the stuff that's going on and that's going to deliver this year is construction in progress, and we have a pretty good handle on that. I mean getting back to where we were before. I mean Chris said it in his prepared remarks, over the next few years, getting back to 6% to 7% is going to mean that starts need to start getting back to where they were.  Now starts this year, we think, will be about flat maybe slightly down. That will be down in the U.S., up in international, which is consistent with what we've been saying. We're still going to start 66,000 rooms for construction this year, which we think is still a pretty good rate of conversions. And then we think that on a run rate basis, and some of that's going to be filled in by conversions. I mean, we mentioned some of that in our prepared remarks. Conversions, we think, are going to be up, were up 35% in the first quarter -- year-over-year. We think they're going to be up around 25% -- to about 25% or higher of our deliveries this year, so that will help fill in.  And then we think we'll get back to that run rate on a run rate basis sometime in 2024. We think we'll be back to the 6% to 7%.\nThomas Allen: And then, sorry, just China?\nKevin Jacobs: Oh yes, sorry, China, sorry. Yes. Look, China, what's going on now is that's very much in that part of the world, a face-to-face culture, right? So the fact that they're locked down in Shanghai, a little bit in Beijing, and other places is stopping signings temporarily, but we still think we're going to be up slightly in terms of construction starts. And we think we're going to open about 20% more rooms in China this year than we did last year. And so we think that once you get past kind of what's going on there on the ground, that there's plenty of pent-up demand for the product, and once people can start moving around, we'll be back to sort of business as usual in China.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: On the contract acquisition cost side, it looks like in your guidance, picked up a bit versus pre-pandemic levels. How should we think about this level versus a normalized run rate over the next few years? And is that investment coming in the form of loans and mezzanine equity? Or is it just straight investment in the deals about a future interest?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. I think, look, it is -- this year's guidance implies a little bit lower than last year -- for a start. It is up over 2019. It's largely a good news story, as we've talked about on prior calls, right? I mean -- and it's almost entirely key money. It's not to say that, we never do a little bit of credit support or a little bit of a handful of mezz loans here and there, but it's almost entirely key money that has that elevated from pre-pandemic levels. There's some great deals. Last year like Monarch Beach and -- are all inclusive into Loom and deals like that -- Resorts World Las Vegas was 1 of the big ones.  And so those are great deals to win. Some of them are -- sometimes their conversions as in Monarch Beach, and so they're in the year for the year deals, and they get a little bit of expensive at the high end, as we've talked about. This year's guidance implies a little bit lower than last year, and we'd like to think it will be around there for the next couple of years, because we'd like to think we continue to win more than our fair share of these great deals.  And I think what I'd say overall in closing is, I think it's still only 10% of our deals, 90% of our deals require no capital support from us whatsoever. And I think that our contract acquisition cost still holds up pretty well versus our competitors.\nOperator: The next question is from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: I just wanted to go back to the notion of NUG and construction starts, et cetera, because we do continue to hear bits and pieces around supply chain and availability and cost of materials. Can you just elaborate maybe a bit more on what you're baking into your guide and your thoughts from that perspective?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, happy to, David. I think that, look, the factors are well known, right? Input costs are up. You've got tightness in the labor markets. You've got input prices in terms of commodities. You've got financing. All of which has been the case for a while. And believe it or not, despite what you read, it's actually easing a little bit at the moment, but it's still elevated. And that's all baked into the guidance, right? That's why construction starts will be flat to slightly down this year. Otherwise, they would probably be up materially. They're down 25% roughly to where they were in 2019.  Demand for the product -- based on the optimism and the outlook, demand for the product is actually up. I mean we think our signings will be up in the mid- to high single digits this year. And there's that same level of optimism in terms of people wanting to get the project started, it's just being held back by the factors that you're talking about. So those factors are there. They'll probably be there for some period of time. And we think like all things that are cyclical, they will ease over time. And then the fact that our signings are up is what gives us the confidence to believe that our starts will go back to where they were roughly in 2019 and that our NUG will go back to 6% to 7%.\nChristopher Nassetta: I think that's right. The only thing I'd sort of add to that, and Kevin said earlier in his comments is, inflation is our friend and it's our owner's friend. So if you look at what we've done in the system during COVID as a result of sort of going through every granular, standard for every single brand, we've been able to drive a lot of efficiency at the hotel level. At the same time, obviously, labor costs have been going up. But when you put all of it into the gonkulator, so to speak, with the savings we've created with the inflationary pressures, which are driving their rate up, and obviously, expenses aren't 100% of revenues. So they've got a positive -- they've got positive leverage there.  Even in the face of increased labor costs, we are very confident that across all of our brands on a sort of comparable basis, margins are higher. So the enthusiasm in our owner community and why, as Kevin rightly pointed out, we think signings are going to be up is, that our brands are doing great. They're driving great cheer and people are optimistic with recovery, but they're also looking at an equation where they're going to be able to drive higher margins on the other side.  Now we have to have the financing market sort of continue to input cost, all that, which will take a little bit of time. And in the meantime, we're having great success in the conversion world. We're going to probably, as Kevin said, increased conversions this year relative to last by 600 basis points of total NUG delivery. So we feel pretty good about where we are.\nDavid Katz: Okay. If I may just follow up quickly and use your gonkulator 1 more time. The owned and leased aspect of the model looks like it really has 2 sides to it. One, which is kind of a friend in this recovery and the other that strikes me as a bit more challenging. Are there potential ways in the future that you can deal with the more challenging aspects of it and turn them into a positive in some way?\nKevin Jacobs: Well, sure. I mean, look, first of all, I'll start out with -- I implied this or I said this in my remarks that portfolio -- the performance in that portfolio is improving, that is starting to turn around. It's been concentrated in parts of the world that have been a little bit behind from a COVID recovery perspective, Central Europe and Japan, in particular. As that portfolio recovers, it will contribute meaningfully to our growth rate, meaning the EBITDA in that portfolio is going to grow at a much higher rate over the next couple of years than the overall fee business is. And so it's going to contribute positively to our growth.  So finding a positive there to your question, and we think that from an EBITDA perspective over the course of this year, it's going to turn positive, and then we actually think it will be positive -- slightly positive as an EBITDA contributor this year. And then I think what we can do is what we've been doing, right? I mean we have quite a large portfolio of leased assets when we inherited the company. We've chipped away at it such that it used to be 9% or 10% of the EBITDA of the business on a stabilized basis, it is going to be sub 5% of the -- even when it recovers over the next few years at a higher rate than the overall business, the fee business continues to grow. We shrink the lease portfolio over time. It's going to be less than 5% of the business over time.  We got out of 7 leases last year. We allowed 4 of them to expire and then -- because we couldn't come to terms with the landlord on renewing them or we didn't want to be there, and we converted 3 of them to management or franchise agreements, so they stayed in the system and they moved from the capital heavy part of the business to the capital-light part of the business. So we'll continue to take those opportunities over time. And that will end up being a positive as we shrink that business and grow the rest of the business over time.\nOperator: The next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I wanted to just ask you, when you think about your guidance for the year, and it's great that you have the visibility to provide that. Kind of how are you thinking specifically about which is actually in China and Europe over the balance of the year. You touched on that a little bit with Europe, I guess, with your O&L comments, but maybe just a little -- some more color on how you think that could shape up?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I think at a high level, Smedes, the way I think about Europe is, Europe is recovering quite nicely, not Eastern Europe, but the bulk of our business in Europe is driven by Western Europe. And Europe is not quite as far along as the United States, but has been motoring along. Kevin gave you a few of the stats that I think support that. So we expect, like the U.S., Europe -- Western Europe to continue to recover. Our expectation is Eastern Europe for the foreseeable future is going to be quite challenged. But again, a very, very small insignificant part of the portfolio being impacted by that. And China, obviously, a more complex situation. We have a view. We have forecast, which is why we can build it in and give guidance. I think our expectation is in the second half of the year, as China goes through a process of locking down some of the major cities and then reopening them, that China is going to reopen for China at a minimum. Not necessarily China opening for international arrivals. But as we saw in the early stages of the pandemic when China got way ahead of the rest of the world, when China opens for China in China business, our business does quite well and can recover very, very rapidly.  So our expectation is second half of the year, you will see China start to reopen really with more benefit in the fourth quarter and into next year than in the third quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from Robin Farley from UBS.\nRobin Farley: Just some quick ones. Can you talk a little bit about the booking window? I feel like last fall, it was down to sort of less than a week, and maybe pre-pandemic had been more like 30 days. Just kind of where are we now with that visibility?\nChristopher Nassetta: Booking windows are extending as you might guess. I think within 7 days, it's now -- it had gotten to be a vast majority at the worst of COVID was booked within 7 days. I think we're approaching in April 50-50, plus or minus, like 50% of the business within 7 days, 50% longer. So huge, huge improvement from where we were.\nRobin Farley: Great. And then on the OTA business, the distribution mix. You mentioned it was down, which makes sense as business transient comes back. Was that -- you mentioned 85% direct, which I assume includes I guess...\nChristopher Nassetta: 75% direct. We didn't give an OTA percentage, we typically wouldn't. But we're in sort of the pre-pandemic, we were in the very low teens, which is what we sort of believe the efficient frontier is for the business to be able to drive the best results for our ownership community. And I would say in the quarter, we're basically there, plus or minus.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. And then I guess the last thing on group. And you kind of -- you've addressed a lot of it in your opening remarks. I think you said you expected that by the end of the year to be at 90% of '19 levels. Fair to say that you expect '23 to be kind of back at 2019 levels?  And then also, I don't know if you gave a pacing for like what percent of '23 room nights are booked compared to like what was booked at this time, pre-pandemic. Just to think about it.\nChristopher Nassetta: We didn't. I think the answer to the first question is, yes. I do think '23 will be back at -- for group, will be back at '19 levels. We did not give a stat. I think the stat from the best of my memory is about 15% down versus '19 at the moment for '23. But as I articulated in the prepared comments, our sales folks can hardly keep up with all the leads that are coming in for the second half of this year and particularly into next year. And so I think just given the trajectory of how this recovery has occurred and what we've seen sort of in the year for the year business. I wouldn't read a whole lot into being 15 down for next year.  We have plenty of time to book that. And importantly, the rates are basically low double digits at the moment. The book business is low double digit higher than '19. And so part of what we're obviously trying to do is maximize the outcome, rate flows really nicely for our ownership community. So we're not -- we really don't want to rush too much in this kind of inflationary environment, because we know the business is going to be there, and we want to put it on the books at the highest rates possible.  And so we're sort of taking our time and metering it out. I suspect, as I said, next year, we will be at volumes similar to 2019 when we're done with 2023 and at rates much higher than 2019.\nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities.\nCharles Scholes: For your net unit growth guidance of approximately 5%, how do those -- how do those percentages break down by global region? Or basically, what are those percentages by growth rates by different regions?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. It should be -- Patrick, it should be pretty similar to -- the rooms under construction are about 80% international. I don't have the sub-breakdown in front of me right now for where it breaks out. But it ought to deliver a plus or minus what the rooms under construction are 20% in the U.S., about 80% outside the U.S.\nCharles Scholes: Okay. Do you happen to have any of the -- what the expectation is for the China growth rate?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Well, for openings, I think I said in 1 of my earlier answers, we think that openings -- rooms opened in China this year are going to be 20% up year-over-year.\nOperator: And the next question is from Bill Crow from Raymond James.\nWilliam Crow: Chris, I continue to be -- I continue to be really fascinated by this interplay between the brands and the owners at a time when occupancy and rates are ramping up, but labor continues to be kind of short. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing with guest satisfaction scores and if you have any concerns about that as we head into the busy summer months?\nChristopher Nassetta: We -- yes, I mean I'd say first on the labor front, there are still significant issues that we're seeing, both in what we manage and as we talk to our franchise community, what they're seeing. Over the last 6 months, we've seen a very significant increase in labor coming back into the labor force and our ability to get folks in the hotels, which obviously are needed, given the demand profile and the increases in demand across all segments, as I already described. So we're not all the way anywhere near where we want to be, but the issues are not -- they're not as extreme as they had been at other points in the pandemic, including recently.  In terms of customer satisfaction, I think, listen, I think all service industries have suffered, and we're right there along with the rest of them. We've been intensely monitoring and we have all sorts of ways to do that, both through social, but our own tracking systems that we call self satisfaction and loyalty tracking. And what I've seen is those numbers that had sort of bottomed out in the middle of the pandemic have started to come back and go the other way, as we've been able to get labor and bring some of the services back. Our social scores, I think the last I saw lead the industry and have been moving up in a positive way. So we have -- we're not satisfied with what we're doing right now. I think the team sitting at this table would say, I've been pounding the table a lot. We like what we're doing. We're on a good trajectory. We need to get more labor back in. We need to restore more services, get food and beverage back on track and other services. And we're obviously sensitive -- very sensitive as you sort of implied in your question to the cost structure for our owner community. But the reality is the demand is there, and we're charging for it. So we have to deliver the experience or ultimately we're going to impair our ability to continue to drive rate, if we don't deliver the basic experience.  So I'm confident we will, our owner community broadly. You talk to a lot of them, but I talk to tons of them. They're broadly understanding of it. They're supportive. They're seeing the pricing pressure and they realize that we have to work together to get there. We have been -- as I mentioned in my earlier response, we have been super crazy focused on making sure that when we get to the other side of this, this is a better setup for our owner community than what we had before the pandemic. And we continue to work really hard on that, and we're confident, on a comparable basis, that they will be in a better place and that inflation is their friend, it's our friend and the cost savings and initiatives that we -- that we pursued and implemented during COVID are going to pay dividends for a long time to come.\nOperator: The next question is from Chad Beynon from Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: We've heard a lot about airline price increases recently in, I guess, upcoming in the next couple of months. Seems like the operators are pushing through the fuel increases to the consumer. And I know, in your prepared remarks, you noted that March and spring break were strong for the leisure customer, so it doesn't sound like there's been any pushback at this point. But can you talk about, I guess, what you've seen during different cycles as gas prices have remained elevated and if you think that could impact kind of the mindset of the leisure customer for the rest of '22?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I've been doing this a long time, and we've been studying this a long time, and in fact, got our team to update, R Squared on this, just so we could be technically accurate, I like numbers. And the reality is if you go back over long periods of history, there is not a very high R square. There is not a very high correlation. In fact, there's a very low correlation between what's going on with fuel prices and demand in our business. You can go back to like the '08, '09, when oil hit 150-plus a barrel, and we went, looked at all those periods. And there's not a very high correlation.  I think it has a lot to do with the consumer psychology, which at the moment, there are certainly lots of fears and uncertainty about where the world goes. But at the moment, as I said, the consumer has an abundant amount of savings as do businesses and a burning desire to sort of get out there and do business and/or experience the world having been locked up a lot more than they would have liked to. So we're not really seeing any of it. Now there's also a phenomenon that is we'll shift around, but if you looked at our business prepandemic, sort of roughly 2/3 of the business, 60% to 2/3 were fly to and the rest were drive to.  That's flipped around during the pandemic. And it's still disproportionately, the majority right now even with where we are in recovery, are people driving. So part of this is there's -- now gas prices are going up, too, but maybe not proportionately as much as the airline ticket is. So there is a little bit of a substitution effect that I suspect is going on with people deciding they'll drive a little further, right? They kind of got used to COVID like, hey, it might have been a 2- or 3-hour sort of limit, before and now it's a 5-, 6-, 7-hour limit for what they're willing to endure to drive.  And so it's a long-winded way of saying, we have not seen resistance and we do not, in looking at very detailed analysis of R Squares, we do not historically see a lot of high correlation.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Clarke from Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Just one thing I noticed is the number of managed rooms has actually come down quarter-on-quarter by over 2,000, which is the biggest drop I can find. And some quite big drops by brand, DoubleTree, Waldorf, Astoria. Is this a strategy? Are you moving away from franchise towards managed towards more franchise? And if that's the case, maybe why are you leaning away from the incentive fees in the recovery? Or is this more an owner-led shift?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Look, Richard, it's a good question. I don't have quarter-over-quarter shift in front of me. You're probably right, if you're looking at it, that it's a relatively big shift. Some of that is things converting to franchise, right? They're staying in the system. They're not necessarily coming out. And it's not strategic. We still -- our rooms under construction, like I said earlier, 80% outside the U.S., that's 50-50 managed versus franchise outside the U.S.  So the reality is we go where the demand is in the developed world, a little bit more demand at the lower end right now for new construction, right, and new deliveries. And so we fish where the fish are, right? And so the market takes us there. There's more customer demand and more owner demand a little bit, and again, in the developed world, towards franchising. And in the developing world, it's about 50-50.\nRichard Clarke: And just you just mentioned there that you've seen some shift from managed to franchise. Why does that process take place?\nKevin Jacobs: Where does it take place?\nRobin Farley: No, why does it take place?\nKevin Jacobs: Owner demand -- I mean customer demand for the product at the lower end and owner demand for franchising. So it's...\nChristopher Nassetta: And if you look at the regions of the world, I mean, the U.S. has always been a predominantly sort of franchise-oriented environment. If you look at our makeup here, it's a majority -- vast majority of its franchise. 10 years ago, there was no franchising going on in Europe. Today, they is. So we have a much more sort of blended approach. It's like 50-50. If you went to Asia Pacific, five years ago, 7 years ago, it was 0 franchise. Now franchising is, particularly in China, is growing, and it's an opportunity for us, particularly with mid-market brands, to be able to create a network effect much, much faster.  And we feel super confident in our ability to manage a franchise system. I don't think there's anybody better in terms of delivering great product and great service to customers. So it's driven a lot by sort of the owner desires and sort of the evolution of the business around the world as different parts of the world mature.\nOperator: The next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.\nVince Ciepiel: I had a question on cross-border. Could you remind us like how much international arrivals is as a percentage of your U.S. room nights? I think it's pretty small, but kind of how that business is performing today versus pre-COVID if you've seen recent progress there? And then kind of the other way around, when you look at, say, your European business and North American guests heading there for this summer, can you describe kind of what you've seen with booking behavior in the last few months?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes.\nChristopher Nassetta: Go ahead.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, sure, on a normalized basis and you pre-Covid the U.S. is about 95:5, right? About 95% of the customers comes from inside the U.S. 5% outside. Now in big cities like New York, San Francisco, L.A., that could be up to 20% for cross-border. That obviously plummeted during COVID, right, to near 0 and now is actually approaching pretty close to normalized mix, both in the U.S. and Europe. Europe is more about 2/3, 1/3 within the region and outside of the region. And again, that's actually back to approaching levels where it was pre-COVID as the world is opening up.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChristopher Nassetta: Thank you, Chad, and thank you all for joining us today. I think you could probably hear the enthusiasm in our voice. It's been quite a couple of years, but I do believe that the decisions we made, the actions we took during the pandemic have put Hilton in the best position it's ever been in from the standpoint of driving performance, margins, driving free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders in the years to come. We're super excited about what we think is going to play out for the rest of the year, and we'll look forward after the second quarter to updating you on that progress. Thanks again for the time today.\nOperator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 80.5% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. System-wide RevPAR was down 17% compared to 2019, impacted by the Omicron variant. Following a seasonally slow start to the year, demand picked up across all segments and regions in March, driven by continued strength in leisure demand and loosening corporate travel restrictions. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $448 million in the first quarter. Results reflect the continued recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 79%, driven by meaningful RevPAR improvement and strong Honors license fees. Continued cost control further benefited results. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the more challenging operating environment, particularly at the start of the year in Europe and Japan, where the portfolio is concentrated. Fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties also pressured results. However, performance improved throughout the quarter, driven by strengthening demand across Europe in March. Rebounding fundamentals, coupled with cost discipline should continue to drive significant growth in operating performance going forward. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.71. Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 77% year-over-year and was down 13% versus 2019. While the Omicron variant weighed on demand at the beginning of the year, RevPAR improved 17 percentage points over the course of the quarter, which marks down less than 6% versus 2019. Leisure travel continued to lead the recovery with segment RevPAR exceeding 2019 levels for the quarter. Upticks in business transient and group travel, particularly in March, also contributed to solid performance in the quarter. In the Americas outside of the U.S., first quarter RevPAR increased 137% year-over-year and was down 17% versus 2019. The Omicron variant suppressed demand in January and February, but rebounded in March led by strong leisure demand, particularly at resort properties during the spring break season.  In Europe, RevPAR grew 349% year-over-year and was down 30% to 2019. Travel demand accelerated following the Omicron outbreak with March RevPAR down 13% compared to 2019. The region benefited from easing travel restrictions and an increase in cross-border travel. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 121% year-over-year and was up 8% versus 2019. Performance continued to benefit from strong domestic leisure demand and greater international inbound travel as travel restrictions across Europe loosened.  In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR grew 11% year-over-year and was down 47% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 45% compared to 2019, as travel restrictions and reimposed lockdown suppressed demand. The rest of the Asia Pacific region saw modest improvement in demand recovery as more countries loosen border and arrival controls in March.  Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the first quarter, we grew net units 5%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling over 410,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 60% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. We continue to see robust demand for Hilton-branded properties, demonstrating owner and developer confidence in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands. For the full year, we expect signings to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit range year-over-year, and we expect net unit growth of approximately 5%. Moving to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 45% and 50% year-over-year or down 5% to 10% compared to second quarter 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $590 million and $610 million, and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, to be between $0.98 and $1.03. For the full year 2022, we expect RevPAR growth between 32% and 38%. Relative to 2019, we expect RevPAR growth to be down 5% to 9%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 40% at the midpoint, and essentially recovered to peak 2019 adjusted EBITDA. We forecast diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of between $3.77 and $4.02. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. As Chris mentioned, we reinstated our share repurchase program in March, which had been suspended during the pandemic. Year-to-date through April, we completed approximately $265 million in buybacks and our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, based on our adjusted EBITDA forecast and assuming the high end of our target leverage range of 3 to 3.5x. After demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business model during the pandemic, we continue to evaluate the possibility of a modestly higher target leverage range in the future. Overall, we are proud of how we navigated the pandemic and remain confident in our ability to continue generating substantial free cash flow and delivering meaningful shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. Chad, can we have our first question, please? Yes, Shaun. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks that may have been a little garbled, but it implies that high end of the range, it implies 3.5x. So embedded in that, yes, we've said and I said it in my prepared remarks that we continue to think about potentially increasing leverage modestly over time. We think the balance sheet is shown that it can handle a higher level of leverage and the business can handle a higher level of leverage given what we just went through.  And -- but there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. And so we're starting with effectively 0.25x increase at the midpoint by saying we're at the high end of the range, and we'll take it from there. Yes, sure. No problem. Look, we -- we're giving you the guidance. So we're highly confident that we can achieve it. Obviously, a lot of the stuff that's going on and that's going to deliver this year is construction in progress, and we have a pretty good handle on that. I mean getting back to where we were before. I mean Chris said it in his prepared remarks, over the next few years, getting back to 6% to 7% is going to mean that starts need to start getting back to where they were.  Now starts this year, we think, will be about flat maybe slightly down. That will be down in the U.S., up in international, which is consistent with what we've been saying. We're still going to start 66,000 rooms for construction this year, which we think is still a pretty good rate of conversions. And then we think that on a run rate basis, and some of that's going to be filled in by conversions. I mean, we mentioned some of that in our prepared remarks. Conversions, we think, are going to be up, were up 35% in the first quarter -- year-over-year. We think they're going to be up around 25% -- to about 25% or higher of our deliveries this year, so that will help fill in.  And then we think we'll get back to that run rate on a run rate basis sometime in 2024. We think we'll be back to the 6% to 7%. Oh yes, sorry, China, sorry. Yes. Look, China, what's going on now is that's very much in that part of the world, a face-to-face culture, right? So the fact that they're locked down in Shanghai, a little bit in Beijing, and other places is stopping signings temporarily, but we still think we're going to be up slightly in terms of construction starts. And we think we're going to open about 20% more rooms in China this year than we did last year. And so we think that once you get past kind of what's going on there on the ground, that there's plenty of pent-up demand for the product, and once people can start moving around, we'll be back to sort of business as usual in China. Yes, sure. I think, look, it is -- this year's guidance implies a little bit lower than last year -- for a start. It is up over 2019. It's largely a good news story, as we've talked about on prior calls, right? I mean -- and it's almost entirely key money. It's not to say that, we never do a little bit of credit support or a little bit of a handful of mezz loans here and there, but it's almost entirely key money that has that elevated from pre-pandemic levels. There's some great deals. Last year like Monarch Beach and -- are all inclusive into Loom and deals like that -- Resorts World Las Vegas was 1 of the big ones.  And so those are great deals to win. Some of them are -- sometimes their conversions as in Monarch Beach, and so they're in the year for the year deals, and they get a little bit of expensive at the high end, as we've talked about. This year's guidance implies a little bit lower than last year, and we'd like to think it will be around there for the next couple of years, because we'd like to think we continue to win more than our fair share of these great deals.  And I think what I'd say overall in closing is, I think it's still only 10% of our deals, 90% of our deals require no capital support from us whatsoever. And I think that our contract acquisition cost still holds up pretty well versus our competitors. Yes, happy to, David. I think that, look, the factors are well known, right? Input costs are up. You've got tightness in the labor markets. You've got input prices in terms of commodities. You've got financing. All of which has been the case for a while. And believe it or not, despite what you read, it's actually easing a little bit at the moment, but it's still elevated. And that's all baked into the guidance, right? That's why construction starts will be flat to slightly down this year. Otherwise, they would probably be up materially. They're down 25% roughly to where they were in 2019.  Demand for the product -- based on the optimism and the outlook, demand for the product is actually up. I mean we think our signings will be up in the mid- to high single digits this year. And there's that same level of optimism in terms of people wanting to get the project started, it's just being held back by the factors that you're talking about. So those factors are there. They'll probably be there for some period of time. And we think like all things that are cyclical, they will ease over time. And then the fact that our signings are up is what gives us the confidence to believe that our starts will go back to where they were roughly in 2019 and that our NUG will go back to 6% to 7%. Well, sure. I mean, look, first of all, I'll start out with -- I implied this or I said this in my remarks that portfolio -- the performance in that portfolio is improving, that is starting to turn around. It's been concentrated in parts of the world that have been a little bit behind from a COVID recovery perspective, Central Europe and Japan, in particular. As that portfolio recovers, it will contribute meaningfully to our growth rate, meaning the EBITDA in that portfolio is going to grow at a much higher rate over the next couple of years than the overall fee business is. And so it's going to contribute positively to our growth.  So finding a positive there to your question, and we think that from an EBITDA perspective over the course of this year, it's going to turn positive, and then we actually think it will be positive -- slightly positive as an EBITDA contributor this year. And then I think what we can do is what we've been doing, right? I mean we have quite a large portfolio of leased assets when we inherited the company. We've chipped away at it such that it used to be 9% or 10% of the EBITDA of the business on a stabilized basis, it is going to be sub 5% of the -- even when it recovers over the next few years at a higher rate than the overall business, the fee business continues to grow. We shrink the lease portfolio over time. It's going to be less than 5% of the business over time.  We got out of 7 leases last year. We allowed 4 of them to expire and then -- because we couldn't come to terms with the landlord on renewing them or we didn't want to be there, and we converted 3 of them to management or franchise agreements, so they stayed in the system and they moved from the capital heavy part of the business to the capital-light part of the business. So we'll continue to take those opportunities over time. And that will end up being a positive as we shrink that business and grow the rest of the business over time. Yes. It should be -- Patrick, it should be pretty similar to -- the rooms under construction are about 80% international. I don't have the sub-breakdown in front of me right now for where it breaks out. But it ought to deliver a plus or minus what the rooms under construction are 20% in the U.S., about 80% outside the U.S. Yes. Well, for openings, I think I said in 1 of my earlier answers, we think that openings -- rooms opened in China this year are going to be 20% up year-over-year. Yes. Look, Richard, it's a good question. I don't have quarter-over-quarter shift in front of me. You're probably right, if you're looking at it, that it's a relatively big shift. Some of that is things converting to franchise, right? They're staying in the system. They're not necessarily coming out. And it's not strategic. We still -- our rooms under construction, like I said earlier, 80% outside the U.S., that's 50-50 managed versus franchise outside the U.S.  So the reality is we go where the demand is in the developed world, a little bit more demand at the lower end right now for new construction, right, and new deliveries. And so we fish where the fish are, right? And so the market takes us there. There's more customer demand and more owner demand a little bit, and again, in the developed world, towards franchising. And in the developing world, it's about 50-50. Where does it take place? Owner demand -- I mean customer demand for the product at the lower end and owner demand for franchising. So it's... Yes. Yes, sure, on a normalized basis and you pre-Covid the U.S. is about 95:5, right? About 95% of the customers comes from inside the U.S. 5% outside. Now in big cities like New York, San Francisco, L.A., that could be up to 20% for cross-border. That obviously plummeted during COVID, right, to near 0 and now is actually approaching pretty close to normalized mix, both in the U.S. and Europe. Europe is more about 2/3, 1/3 within the region and outside of the region. And again, that's actually back to approaching levels where it was pre-COVID as the world is opening up."

            "name": "Christopher Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a minute to express our sadness at the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine. Our hotels have always been a part of the fabric of the communities we serve, and we take our promise to make those communities better places to live and work very seriously. Along with the steps we've taken to protect our team members and guests, we've also partnered with American Express and our ownership community to donate up to 1 million room nights across Europe to support Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian relief efforts. Additionally, the Hilton Global Foundation has contributed to World Central Kitchen and Project Hope to further assist with the humanitarian aid. We are keeping our Hilton family and everyone impacted by these horrific events in our thoughts and hope for a peaceful resolution to this crisis. Our Hilton values and purpose-led culture have led us through uncertainty as well as recovery. Our team members around the world have worked hard to effectively navigate the challenges over the last 2 years, and as a result, have positioned Hilton even stronger for the future. As we look to the year ahead, we are optimistic that our industry-leading RevPAR premiums and fee-based capital-light business model, coupled with further demand recovery, will continue to drive strong performance and meaningful free cash flow, which will enable us to return significant capital to shareholders in a disciplined way. With recent performance exceeding our expectation, we were pleased to have resumed our Capital Return Program earlier than anticipated, beginning share repurchases in March. Through April, we had completed approximately $265 million of buybacks. Additionally, we have declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, further highlighting the confidence in continued recovery and the strength of our model. For the year, we expect to return $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Turning to results in the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased more than 80% year-over-year, driving adjusted EBITDA up 126%. RevPAR was approximately 83% of 2019 levels with adjusted EBITDA at 90%. Despite a choppy start to the year given Omicron related demand pressures, trends picked up meaningfully month-over-month with RevPAR declines versus 2019 improving approximately 17 percentage points from January to March, down only 9% to 2019, driven by acceleration across all segments. In March, system-wide rates were up 3% compared to 2019. Strong leisure transient trends continued to boost weekend performance with RevPAR in the quarter exceeding 2019 levels and rates up approximately 9% versus prior peaks, acceleration in business transient and group trends drove meaningful improvement midweek. U.S. business transient RevPAR increased sequentially versus the fourth quarter, with March down only 9% compared to 2019 levels. Improving trends from large accounts, along with continued strength from SMEs results. In March, revenue from large accounts was just 12% below 2019. Overall business transient now comprises 45% of total segment mix just 10-point shy of prepandemic levels. For April, overall U.S. transient booked revenue for all future periods was up 17% versus 2019 levels, with rates up 10% and room nights up 7%. Weekday booked revenue was up 9% compared to 2019 and weekend booked revenue was up 38%, driven largely by strong rate gains. On the group side, social and smaller events continue to lead recovery, while demand for company meetings and conventions improved meaningfully throughout the quarter. In March, total group RevPAR was more than 75% of 2019 levels, improving approximately 25 points versus January. Additionally, group revenue booked in the first quarter for all future periods was down just 4% relative to 2019 levels, and total lead volume for all future periods was up 3.5%. Compared to 2019, our tentative booking revenue is up significantly with rate gains for company meetings up more than 13%. Additionally, rates on new group bookings for in-year arrivals are strong, up in the high single digits versus 2019. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain optimistic. Positive momentum has continued into the second quarter with April RevPAR tracking at roughly 95% of 2019 levels. While macro risks and uncertainty exists, forecast for economic growth remain healthy. Additionally, our ability to reprice rooms in real time creates a natural inflation hedge. We think there is a good likelihood that we'll reach 2019 system-wide RevPAR levels during the third quarter.  For the full year, we expect leisure RevPAR to exceed 2019 peak levels given excess consumer savings, a strong job market and pent-up demand. We expect business transient to be roughly back to 2019 levels by year-end, with expectations supported by rising corporate profits, rebounding demand from big businesses, and loosening travel restrictions. On the group side, we expect RevPAR to be at approximately 90% of 2019 levels by year-end, as demand for company meetings and convention business accelerates into the back half of the year. On the development front, our leading RevPAR index premiums and powerful commercial engines continued to drive out performance. In the quarter, we added more than 13,000 rooms and achieved 5% net unit growth. We continue to deliver on our commitment to discipline and strategic growth, celebrating important milestones across segments and geographies. We opened our 500th Homewood in the U.S., our 50th Hilton Garden Inn in Asia Pacific and debuted our largest hotel in the Asia Pacific region with the opening of the 1,080 room Hilton Singapore Orchard. With a contemporary design, innovative dining experiences and extensive meeting space, the property is a fantastic representation of our flagship brand and puts us in an even stronger position in Asia to usher in a new era of travel. Building on last quarter's momentum, we also continued expanding our lifestyle portfolio with the openings of the Canopy Boston Downtown and the Canopy New Orleans. Even with strong openings, we grew our pipeline to more than 410,000 rooms up year-over-year and versus the fourth quarter. We continue to lead the industry in new development signings with Home2 Suites surpassing all other competitor brands globally. We demonstrated our commitment to further expand our luxury and lifestyle portfolios in the world's most sought-after destinations with the signing of the Waldorf Astoria Sydney, the Conrad Austin Hotel & Residences, and Canopy Properties in Cannes and Downtown Nashville. We look forward to delivering world-class service and unforgettable experiences in these exciting destinations. Conversion signings in the quarter were up 15% year-over-year and represented nearly 20% of overall signings. In recent months, we signed agreements to bring our conversion-friendly brands, Curio and Tapestry to exciting destinations like the Galapagos Islands, San Sebastian Spain, Maui and Sonoma County, California. DoubleTree has continued to lead the way for European upscale growth with new conversion properties across France, Germany and the Netherlands. While rising costs are pressuring construction starts, we are on track to deliver 5% net unit growth for the year and remain confident in our ability to return to a 6% to 7% growth rate over the next few years. Reliable and friendly service are at the heart of our promise to our guests and we continue to leverage our direct channels to offer them even more personalized experiences. Direct bookings continued to grow in the quarter that represent roughly 75% of our total bookings led by growth in Digital Direct. OTA mix continued to decline and is approaching pre-pandemic levels as increases in business transient and group demand shifted customer mix. In the quarter, Hilton Honors membership grew 15% to more than 133 million members. Honors members accounted for 60% of occupancy, flat versus the first quarter of 2019. And average nights per member were up 11% year-over-year as engagement continued to grow.  As we continue recovering from the impacts of the pandemic, I am inspired every day by the dedication of our team members as we welcome more guests back to our hotels. It's because of them and our culture of hospitality, that we continue to be recognized as a Great Place To Work. In fact, Hilton was recently named the #2 best company to work for in the United States by Fortune and Great Place to Work, something I'm truly proud of. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on our results in the quarter and our expectations for the year ahead. Kevin? Yes. I mean, we gave a lot of commentary on rate growth in the sense of giving you as much visibility as we had to represent the strength that we're seeing. I mean, we're wonderful, as I said in my prepared comments, inflation hedge because we can reprice every minute of every day. And as demand has picked up, we have certainly been able to do that, and we expect that we will continue to be able to do that. I think as the year goes on, we expect the largest part of RevPAR growth to come from rate growth. We obviously expect to see occupancy growth as well. But I think net-net, it will be majority driven by rate. In terms of the segments, leisure, broadly remains quite strong. I mean, right now, I think the number is consumers still have $2.5 trillion of excess savings that they accumulated during the pandemic in their pockets. While people have been out traveling a lot more than they had maybe a year ago, there's still a lot of people that haven't and a lot of people that really want to get out and have experiences. And so people that we have pretty full employment. People have a lot of money in their bank accounts. And I think now feel quite safe broadly, certainly here in the U.S., not everywhere in the world. Obviously, the world is a big place, but in the Western world feel safe going out. And so we expect to see very strong leisure continue. I mean we think we'll probably have the biggest leisure summer we've ever had, only to surpass last summer, which was the biggest leisure summer we had ever seen, prior to what I think we'll see this summer. And then as we get into the fall and as people go -- are back more in the office, which we certainly are seeing now and expect to see more of, we're seeing, as I articulated and Kevin did as well, we're seeing a very nice uptick in return to business transient and return on the group side.  The group side lags a little bit as we know. There's more planning involved in that, but we think the second half of the year is going to get stronger and stronger. And business transient, even over the last couple of months, we've seen pick up. And notably, and something I commented on in my prepared remarks, we've even seen the large corporates start to come back, where March was only 12% down. And April, you can assume was better. We don't have all the data on the breakdown in April, but certainly broadly, business transient was even better in April. So businesses have a lot of pent-up demand, needs for travel. Balance sheets are very, very strong. Profits are very strong. Liquidity is very, very strong. And so I think the combination of that, with what's going on with the consumer, and then sort of the icing on the cake is the group side, where there's just so much new demand, but then pent-up demand, all of which I think will start to converge here in the second half of this year and into next year. I think puts us in a place where we feel really good about the short to intermediate term, and both the demand side, but particularly the rate side. And again, the reason I gave, the stats I did about forward-looking booking trends on the transient side, which obviously only is so far out. But on the Group side, was that we really are seeing the ability to drive pricing power like a lot of industries are, but certainly makes us -- gives us the optimism that has led to our judgments on both giving guidance, but also on our return to capital program and the like. Yes. Well, let me -- first, in terms of the mix, it's probably worth stating because I commented a teeny bit in my prepared comments. You're right, business transit sort of the mix pre-COVID was plus or minus 55 business transient, 25 leisure transient and 20 group. If you look at, sort of what I would sort of call, the bottom of the recession driven by the pandemic, it went to 35 business transient, 55 leisure and 10 group. Now it's 45 business transient, 39 leisure and 16 group.  And I've been saying this so pretty much for 2 years. In the beginning, people maybe thought it was crazy, but that when we wake up and this sort of flushes through the system and we get fully on the other side of it, that business mix is going to look an awful lot like it did pre-COVID. And I think we're on our way to that. And so I think when we look -- maybe not , I think leisure transient will probably remain elevated for a while. But I think it will -- it is regressing to the mean, and it will look more like it did than like it has looked, in '23 and certainly in '24.  In terms of broader pricing pressures, as all that comes back, not to be pedantic about it, but it's sort of the laws of supply and demand, economics, which is, if we have a product that's in high demand and increasing demand, and there's not a lot more -- there's not enough supply and not a lot is being added, which is sort of the case in terms of what's going on with all of our segments increasingly so in midweek and that's only going to increase and then you compound that with getting a decent group base starting in the second half of the year and the next year, I think we'll have meaningful pricing power next year, just because the laws of supply and demand suggest we should. And I think they're alive and well. Yes. Well, I mean, the guidance we gave is the guidance we gave. First of all -- I mean I think, Shaun, there are -- it's a good question. I think there are some comp issues in certain months. But honestly, if you listen -- if you replay what I just said in response to Carlo's question, we believe that we're going to continue to see a very strong leisure demand base and an increasingly strong leisure -- business transient and group base as we march through the next few quarters of this year and into next year. So we're not trying to signal in our guidance that we think there's something going on from a weakening point of view. We think things are strengthening. I think that's right. The only thing I'd sort of add to that, and Kevin said earlier in his comments is, inflation is our friend and it's our owner's friend. So if you look at what we've done in the system during COVID as a result of sort of going through every granular, standard for every single brand, we've been able to drive a lot of efficiency at the hotel level. At the same time, obviously, labor costs have been going up. But when you put all of it into the gonkulator, so to speak, with the savings we've created with the inflationary pressures, which are driving their rate up, and obviously, expenses aren't 100% of revenues. So they've got a positive -- they've got positive leverage there.  Even in the face of increased labor costs, we are very confident that across all of our brands on a sort of comparable basis, margins are higher. So the enthusiasm in our owner community and why, as Kevin rightly pointed out, we think signings are going to be up is, that our brands are doing great. They're driving great cheer and people are optimistic with recovery, but they're also looking at an equation where they're going to be able to drive higher margins on the other side.  Now we have to have the financing market sort of continue to input cost, all that, which will take a little bit of time. And in the meantime, we're having great success in the conversion world. We're going to probably, as Kevin said, increased conversions this year relative to last by 600 basis points of total NUG delivery. So we feel pretty good about where we are. Yes. I think at a high level, Smedes, the way I think about Europe is, Europe is recovering quite nicely, not Eastern Europe, but the bulk of our business in Europe is driven by Western Europe. And Europe is not quite as far along as the United States, but has been motoring along. Kevin gave you a few of the stats that I think support that. So we expect, like the U.S., Europe -- Western Europe to continue to recover. Our expectation is Eastern Europe for the foreseeable future is going to be quite challenged. But again, a very, very small insignificant part of the portfolio being impacted by that. And China, obviously, a more complex situation. We have a view. We have forecast, which is why we can build it in and give guidance. I think our expectation is in the second half of the year, as China goes through a process of locking down some of the major cities and then reopening them, that China is going to reopen for China at a minimum. Not necessarily China opening for international arrivals. But as we saw in the early stages of the pandemic when China got way ahead of the rest of the world, when China opens for China in China business, our business does quite well and can recover very, very rapidly.  So our expectation is second half of the year, you will see China start to reopen really with more benefit in the fourth quarter and into next year than in the third quarter. Booking windows are extending as you might guess. I think within 7 days, it's now -- it had gotten to be a vast majority at the worst of COVID was booked within 7 days. I think we're approaching in April 50-50, plus or minus, like 50% of the business within 7 days, 50% longer. So huge, huge improvement from where we were. 75% direct. We didn't give an OTA percentage, we typically wouldn't. But we're in sort of the pre-pandemic, we were in the very low teens, which is what we sort of believe the efficient frontier is for the business to be able to drive the best results for our ownership community. And I would say in the quarter, we're basically there, plus or minus. We didn't. I think the answer to the first question is, yes. I do think '23 will be back at -- for group, will be back at '19 levels. We did not give a stat. I think the stat from the best of my memory is about 15% down versus '19 at the moment for '23. But as I articulated in the prepared comments, our sales folks can hardly keep up with all the leads that are coming in for the second half of this year and particularly into next year. And so I think just given the trajectory of how this recovery has occurred and what we've seen sort of in the year for the year business. I wouldn't read a whole lot into being 15 down for next year.  We have plenty of time to book that. And importantly, the rates are basically low double digits at the moment. The book business is low double digit higher than '19. And so part of what we're obviously trying to do is maximize the outcome, rate flows really nicely for our ownership community. So we're not -- we really don't want to rush too much in this kind of inflationary environment, because we know the business is going to be there, and we want to put it on the books at the highest rates possible.  And so we're sort of taking our time and metering it out. I suspect, as I said, next year, we will be at volumes similar to 2019 when we're done with 2023 and at rates much higher than 2019. We -- yes, I mean I'd say first on the labor front, there are still significant issues that we're seeing, both in what we manage and as we talk to our franchise community, what they're seeing. Over the last 6 months, we've seen a very significant increase in labor coming back into the labor force and our ability to get folks in the hotels, which obviously are needed, given the demand profile and the increases in demand across all segments, as I already described. So we're not all the way anywhere near where we want to be, but the issues are not -- they're not as extreme as they had been at other points in the pandemic, including recently.  In terms of customer satisfaction, I think, listen, I think all service industries have suffered, and we're right there along with the rest of them. We've been intensely monitoring and we have all sorts of ways to do that, both through social, but our own tracking systems that we call self satisfaction and loyalty tracking. And what I've seen is those numbers that had sort of bottomed out in the middle of the pandemic have started to come back and go the other way, as we've been able to get labor and bring some of the services back. Our social scores, I think the last I saw lead the industry and have been moving up in a positive way. So we have -- we're not satisfied with what we're doing right now. I think the team sitting at this table would say, I've been pounding the table a lot. We like what we're doing. We're on a good trajectory. We need to get more labor back in. We need to restore more services, get food and beverage back on track and other services. And we're obviously sensitive -- very sensitive as you sort of implied in your question to the cost structure for our owner community. But the reality is the demand is there, and we're charging for it. So we have to deliver the experience or ultimately we're going to impair our ability to continue to drive rate, if we don't deliver the basic experience.  So I'm confident we will, our owner community broadly. You talk to a lot of them, but I talk to tons of them. They're broadly understanding of it. They're supportive. They're seeing the pricing pressure and they realize that we have to work together to get there. We have been -- as I mentioned in my earlier response, we have been super crazy focused on making sure that when we get to the other side of this, this is a better setup for our owner community than what we had before the pandemic. And we continue to work really hard on that, and we're confident, on a comparable basis, that they will be in a better place and that inflation is their friend, it's our friend and the cost savings and initiatives that we -- that we pursued and implemented during COVID are going to pay dividends for a long time to come. Yes. I've been doing this a long time, and we've been studying this a long time, and in fact, got our team to update, R Squared on this, just so we could be technically accurate, I like numbers. And the reality is if you go back over long periods of history, there is not a very high R square. There is not a very high correlation. In fact, there's a very low correlation between what's going on with fuel prices and demand in our business. You can go back to like the '08, '09, when oil hit 150-plus a barrel, and we went, looked at all those periods. And there's not a very high correlation.  I think it has a lot to do with the consumer psychology, which at the moment, there are certainly lots of fears and uncertainty about where the world goes. But at the moment, as I said, the consumer has an abundant amount of savings as do businesses and a burning desire to sort of get out there and do business and/or experience the world having been locked up a lot more than they would have liked to. So we're not really seeing any of it. Now there's also a phenomenon that is we'll shift around, but if you looked at our business prepandemic, sort of roughly 2/3 of the business, 60% to 2/3 were fly to and the rest were drive to.  That's flipped around during the pandemic. And it's still disproportionately, the majority right now even with where we are in recovery, are people driving. So part of this is there's -- now gas prices are going up, too, but maybe not proportionately as much as the airline ticket is. So there is a little bit of a substitution effect that I suspect is going on with people deciding they'll drive a little further, right? They kind of got used to COVID like, hey, it might have been a 2- or 3-hour sort of limit, before and now it's a 5-, 6-, 7-hour limit for what they're willing to endure to drive.  And so it's a long-winded way of saying, we have not seen resistance and we do not, in looking at very detailed analysis of R Squares, we do not historically see a lot of high correlation. And if you look at the regions of the world, I mean, the U.S. has always been a predominantly sort of franchise-oriented environment. If you look at our makeup here, it's a majority -- vast majority of its franchise. 10 years ago, there was no franchising going on in Europe. Today, they is. So we have a much more sort of blended approach. It's like 50-50. If you went to Asia Pacific, five years ago, 7 years ago, it was 0 franchise. Now franchising is, particularly in China, is growing, and it's an opportunity for us, particularly with mid-market brands, to be able to create a network effect much, much faster.  And we feel super confident in our ability to manage a franchise system. I don't think there's anybody better in terms of delivering great product and great service to customers. So it's driven a lot by sort of the owner desires and sort of the evolution of the business around the world as different parts of the world mature. Go ahead. Thank you, Chad, and thank you all for joining us today. I think you could probably hear the enthusiasm in our voice. It's been quite a couple of years, but I do believe that the decisions we made, the actions we took during the pandemic have put Hilton in the best position it's ever been in from the standpoint of driving performance, margins, driving free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders in the years to come. We're super excited about what we think is going to play out for the rest of the year, and we'll look forward after the second quarter to updating you on that progress. Thanks again for the time today."

Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.  With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are happy to report a great end to what was another really strong year for Hilton. For the year, system-wide RevPAR grew 12.6% versus 2022 with solid growth across every major region and chain scale compared to 2019, RevPAR increased 10.7%. Strong top line performance drove record adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.1 billion, up roughly 20% year-over-year to the highest level in our company's history. During the year, we launched two new brands, introduced new innovations, expanded our partnerships and opened a near record number of rooms, all of which further strengthened our network and enabled us to welcome more guests than ever before. Our strong top and bottom line performance drove significant free cash flow, enabling us to return $2.5 billion to shareholders. Turning to results for the quarter. System wide RevPAR increased 5.7% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations, driven by strong international and group trends. Group RevPAR rose 6% year-over-year due to an uptick in small company meetings and convention demand. Business transient recovery continued in the quarter with RevPAR up more than 4% [visited] by gains in both rate and occupancy. As expected, leisure transient RevPAR increased 3%, decelerating modestly versus the third quarter, largely due to seasonality. Compared to 2019, system wide RevPAR grew 13.5% in the quarter, up more than 200 basis points sequentially compared to the third quarter. Demand continued to improve with December system wide occupancy reaching 2019 peak levels. Group RevPAR outperformed expectations, increasing 8% versus 2019 and up more than 700 basis points sequentially versus the third quarter. Business transient continued to recover growing 5% versus 2019. As expected, leisure RevPAR remained strong growing 25% versus 2019 and decelerating sequentially due to calendar shifts. As we look to the year ahead, we expect system wide top line growth of 2% to 4% versus 2023. We expect performance to be driven by continued growth across all major regions with international markets modestly outpacing the US. We also expect positive RevPAR growth across all segments, driven by continued recovery in business transient and group coupled with steady leisure demand. We expect continued recovery in small company meetings and large association and convention business to drive strong group performance. For 2024, group positions is up 16% year-over-year with small companies meetings increasing as a percentage of mix, further demonstrating the value of small and medium sized businesses given higher rates and greater resiliency. Turning to development. We continue to see positive momentum throughout the year opening 24,000 rooms in the fourth quarter, marking the largest quarter of openings in our history. We achieved several milestones in the quarter, including the openings of our 250th Tru Hotel and our 1000th Hilton Garden Inn. We also reached 70,000 rooms globally for Home2. Additionally, we celebrated the opening of Signia by Hilton Atlanta, the city's largest ground up development in over 40 years. The property strategically located next to the Georgia World Congress Center and Mercedes-Benz Stadium features nearly a thousand rooms and over a hundred thousand square feet of meeting space, including the largest hotel ballroom in Georgia. For the full year, we opened 395 hotels, totaling approximately 63,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 4.9%. Conversion activity remains strong, accounting for 30% of openings and demonstrating the strong value proposition our system continues to deliver for owners. Full service and collection brands represented the large majority of conversions and continue to gain traction with owners. Both Curio and Tapestry open more hotels in 2023 than in any other year. Even with robust openings, our pipeline reached the highest level in our history, driven by record signings of 130,000 rooms, up 45% year-over-year and up 12% compared to pre-pandemic levels. At year end, our pipeline totaled over 462,000 rooms with roughly half under construction following a strong year in construction starts. For the full year, starts increased 15%, driven by the US. We continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company with approximately one in every five hotel rooms under construction globally slated to join our system. As we look to the year ahead, we expect continued positive momentum in signing starts and conversions to drive even stronger openings, boosted by our two newest brands, Spark and LivSmart Studios. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth to accelerate to the higher end of our 5.5% to 6% guidance range with the opportunity for further upside of 25 to 50 basis points from our exclusive partnership with Small Luxury Hotels of the World that we announced this morning. This partnership will meaningfully expand our luxury distribution as we expect to add the majority of their over 500 hotels to our system. Adding this extraordinary portfolio with a heavy orientation to resort locations to our already strong and growing luxury portfolio will further enhance a powerful network effect and give our guests even more opportunities to dream, book, earn and burn points, and we're doing so in a capital light way. The royalty rate will be in line with our existing brands, but fees will be paid only on the business driven through our channels. We expect over time to drive a meaningful portion of system revenues for SLH, and we'll start to integrate hotels into our system later this spring. Last quarter, we announced Hilton for Business, our multifaceted program designed to transform the travel experience for small and medium sized businesses by providing a new booking Web site along with targeted benefits designed specifically for SMBs. The program launched in January with thousands of companies registering in just the first few weeks. SMBs account for approximately 85% of our business transient mix and comprising meaningful and growing percentage of our group mix. Given its greater resiliency and higher rates, we think this important customer base provides significant opportunities to drive further growth. Overall, we remain focused on creating unique experiences in our hotels, including through innovative food and beverage offerings. We recently announced the launch of StiR Creative Collective, an in-house consulting and development arm that gives us the ability to work with our owners, operators and hotel teams to elevate food and beverage offerings to meet the evolving needs of our guests. Several noteworthy StiR projects have already launched at the Conrad Orlando, the Canopy by Hilton in Toronto and the new Signia in Atlanta. In a business of people serving people, our team members are at the heart of absolutely everything we do. We recently celebrated the remarkable achievement of being named the number one world's best workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This recognition follows eight consecutive appearances on the world's best list and marks the first time a hospitality company has achieved the top honor in this best in class program. Additionally, for the seventh consecutive year, we were honored to be included on both the world and North America Dow Jones sustainability indices, the most prestigious ranking for corporate sustainability performance. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance with our world class brands and powerful commercial engines driving a record pipeline and accelerating net unit growth. We're confident in our ability to continue delivering value for all of our stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.  Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to give a bit more detail on the quarter and our expectations for the year ahead.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system wide RevPAR grew 5.7% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong international performance and continued recovery in group and business transient. Adjusted EBITDA was $803 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better than expected fee growth, largely due to better than expected RevPAR performance and license fee growth. Management and franchise fees grew 12% year-over-year. For the quarter diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $1.68. Turning to our regional performance. Fourth quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 2% year-over-year with performance led by both business, transient and group. Leisure transient in the US was flat with difficult year-over-year comparisons. Relative to 2019 peak levels, US RevPAR increased 11% in the fourth quarter, improving 100 basis points versus the third quarter. In the Americas outside the US, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year with urban markets delivering RevPAR growth of 17% boosted by strong group business. In Europe, RevPAR grew 10% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments. Large events, including the Rugby World Cup in Paris, drove strong group performance across several key cities. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 12% year-over-year, led by strong rate growth. The COP 28 Climate Change Conference in Dubai, along with solid trends in Egypt, contributed to strong performance in the region. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR was up 42% year-over-year, led by continued demand recovery across China and Japan and notable strength across all segments. RevPAR in China was up 73% year-over-year in the quarter with RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region, excluding China, up 18% year-over-year. Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, for the full year, we grew net units 4.9% and ended the year with over 462,000 rooms in our pipeline, which was up 11% year-over-year with approximately 60% located outside the US and nearly half under construction. Looking to the year ahead, we are excited about our strong development story and the robust demand for Hilton branded products in both the US and international markets. Moving to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect system wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $690 million $710 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.36 and $1.44. For full year \u201824, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.33 billion and $3.38 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.80 and $6.94. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $158 million in dividends for the year. For full year 2023, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In the first quarter, our board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect to return approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks.  We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourselves to one question. M. J., can we have our first question please?\nOperator: The first question today comes from Joe Greff with JP Morgan.\nJoe Greff: Chris, I was hoping you can talk about M&A of brands. Obviously, there was an article earlier this week, suggesting you might be close with the Graduate Hotels brand. If you want to comment specifically on this, but I would just love to get your overall view on opportunities for you to acquire brands. And then since it's something that you've been sort of not doing at all, maybe you can revisit some of the criteria for brand M&A.\nChris Nassetta: I'm happy to do that, Joe. I figured with all the rumor and all, I'd get asked this question. Obviously, first and foremost, you're right, I'm not going to comment on market rumors and speculation on anything specific. I would say my attitude, our attitude on M&A is really the same as it's always been. If nothing, we've been consistent and I've been consistent in what I've said. And that is we -- the fact is, as you point out, we haven't done any, but every time I've ever been asked for the last 10 years of being public, I've said never say never, but we have a very tough filtration system. And that filtration system at a high level is, number one, does something really -- is something additive from the standpoint of the portfolio of brands that we have. And from the standpoint of offering our customers, a product and experience that would be really additive to the family of brands that we have, number one. And number two, and importantly, can it be done in a way that's accretive to the value of the company. For the last 16 years, going on 17 years that I've been here, we've looked at pretty much everything. I've said that to everybody and nothing is passed through that filter. So that's the reason we haven't done anything. The environment we're in is a little bit different. There is, for a lot of reasons, interest rates and otherwise, more stress in the system than normal, that probably, I think, presents more opportunity to do things like this, but things that are quite modest in my view and that are what I view as sort of tuck-in acquisitions. Now I still think the filtration system is really rigorous. And obviously, we're not sitting here announcing any acquisitions. We announced a strategic exclusive partnership with SLH that we're very excited about, and I'm sure we'll talk about from other questions on the call. So that we don't have anything to report. And to the extent that we do, obviously, you guys will be the first to know. And so summary is we have no different attitude. We continue to look at everything but the stress in the environment maybe provides a little bit more opportunity than we've seen in quite a long time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: Chris, you obviously -- you talked about the strength in business transient and group that you kind of foresee for 2024. Given those mixes respectively are down couple of hundred basis points from pre-pandemic levels, I was kind of wondering where you think they settle for 2024? And what impact that mix shift has obviously presumably taking away from leisure demand to some degree on ADRs for the year?\nChris Nassetta: I think broadly, if you look at the segments, and I said it at a very high level in the prepared comments, we feel really good about all the segments. Business transient continues to recover. I mean the big corporates finished the year still a bit off, probably 5% off of where they were, but still but growing, every segment in that world is a little bit different. I mean most segments were relatively strong and either back to or beyond prior to pandemic levels with the exception of probably banking, technology and consulting, which were less. But blended together, they weren't that far off. SMB segment is at or above, most of those segments are at or above. And when you blend all that together for the fourth quarter full year from a RevPAR point of view, business transient was ahead, but from an occupancy point of view was still a bit behind. We do think that by the time we finish this year, assuming sort of the broader consensus view of a reasonably soft landing that by the time we get to the end of the year, we think will be at more normalized levels of demand. And we believe given very low supply numbers that are continuing and continued decent economic growth that we're going to continue to have pricing power there and everywhere else. On the group side, I'll give you a snippet of like group position being up 16%, that's the best leading indicator. But anecdotally, sitting around this very table last week with all our teams from around the world and all of our commercial and sales leads, I've said it, the demand is off the hook. I mean the demand is really strong. Every quarter is the next new high watermark in terms of bookings for all future periods. So we are seeing very good strength. We believe the group demand is quite sticky in the sense that a lot of it still is pent-up demand that are things people haven't done for a long time that they need to do in addition to incremental new demand. You're obviously seeing in the group space, the big association, citywide business start to come back, that's super sticky business because of the time frames associated with the planning and the cost. So we think group will definitely lead the system. And as a result, you asked about rate, which I'll cover on both, we think rate will be very strong. Just there is so much demand and there's just a limited amount of space, if you think about it, not only is supply low broadly, but supply of hotels over the last 10 years that have been built that have a lot of meeting space has been [nimic]. And so you have a lot of demand -- I mean, I was sitting around this table yesterday, we're planning our own conferences for like sales conferences and general managers and all these things that we have to start going out three and four years, because we can't get space in our own hotels. So demand is good as a result with very limited supply, pricing should be good. And then on leisure, we do think it will grow. We do think probably more in rate than volume, because the consumer, particularly our consumer, which is our median income levels, reasonably good. It's in the 140,000 to 150,000 range. They still have plenty of money, plenty of desire to travel. And again, there's just not a lot of new supply. So the fundamental economic setup is good. Obviously, it got supercharged coming out of COVID, so it will probably -- we think it will grow more rate than volume, but it will grow. But it will be third in line after continued recovery starting with group then business transient, then leisure transient. So we feel really good about -- again, based on a broad consensus view that we have a rational sort of reasonably soft landing and continue to see decent -- slowing broadly, but decent economic growth in 2024.\nCarlo Santarelli: And then if I could, just a follow-up on Joe's question from earlier. The guidance for 2024, I'm going to assume that SLH and any kind of tuck-in M&A that you guys do in 2024 would be on top of the guidance that you provided this morning\u2026\nChris Nassetta: Correct. The 5.5% to 6% with a strong indication to the high end of that is pure organic. I said in my prepared comments, we think SLH depends on how rapidly hotels come in, which is why there's a range, 25 to 50 basis points on top of that. And if we were to do anything else, it's all on top of that. But that is the 5.5% to 6% were leading towards the high end of it is pure organic.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Chris, wondering maybe you could build off of the last part there about SLH. And it\u2019s pretty selective. But just A, can you give us a little bit more about the deal itself? And I think it sounds economically quite similar to what we see kind of in the normal course on the fee side, but any color you can provide there? And then I think more importantly is just big picture, do you think there are other collection and places out there that you could utilize your distribution capability and help other systems that may exist out there but not overlap directly with owners, which I know is going to be a sensitivity point for you.\nChris Nassetta: Well, first of all, on SLH, as you hopefully could tell from my prepared comments, we're really excited about it. We've had a relationship there for a while. We've been working with them to figure this out and we're really excited to be able to get it done. I mean if you think about it, it's sort of like the moons and the stars aligned super well for us. We're going to be able to bring the majority of 500 hotels that are super unique, small, obviously, Small Luxury -- it's Small Luxury but very heavy resort orientation and very heavily oriented to very niche markets that are super hard to get into. And so when you look at it vis-a-vis the overlap of our existing -- we have 100 open luxury hotels, we have about another 60, 70 in the pipeline. So a terrific portfolio and growing super rapidly. When you look at the overlap, there is really none just because this is a really unique collection of hotels. We did a bunch of focus groups and customer research around this over the last year and really feel like this offering from the standpoint of our customers, particularly our higher end customers is going to be super well received in terms of their ability to bucket through our channels, but earn points, burn their points, go on their vacations in these places and the like. And so we think it is literally the perfect combination. And an unbelievable way for us to take what is currently 100 -- with pipeline 150, 160 hotel luxury portfolio and turn it into 600 or 700 scattered in all the best and most unique and hard to duplicate places around the world. So we think this is great. Customers, we think, based on all the work we did, are going to really love it, and we're excited to start ramping up including them in all our channels. In terms of the economics, we feel really good about it. As I said, we want to be really straightforward. I mean the license fees that we're getting are very similar sort of in the zone of what we would typically get in all of our -- with our direct brands. One difference in this case, as I said in my comments, we'll get paid on the business we generate, which we think will be significant. I mean it will take time to ramp that up, it will be significant. And that there's real economics in this for us as well. So we think sort of like, as I said, moons and stars, fabulous for the network effect, fabulous for our customers, and we think really good for shareholders in the sense that we'll be generating meaningful fees, and we are investing nothing, it's fully capital light.\nShaun Kelley: And just as a follow-up there, Chris. Just any thoughts on, again, sort of future opportunities that could look like sort of leverage the platform\u2026\nChris Nassetta: I think there are always -- I mean we're looking at lots of different things all the time. I mean since the IPO road show, we have talked a lot about network effect. I mean, very consistently trying to build that out to create an ecosystem that brings customers in and builds loyalty. And so we're always looking at other opportunities. And so I think there are possibilities in that regard. But nothing -- I would say, right now, we're focused on this. This is a lot of effort and work to get these built into the system. And we'll see, we'll see, anything that we think we can do to keep building -- bringing new customers in and giving them and our existing customers more products that resonate with them, that builds more loyalty and that we can commercialize in the sense of being paid for the effort we're interested in. But nothing more to report at this point beyond SLH.\nOperator: The next question is from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Just to follow on the same theme. Is there a case or a strategy or thought around whether SLH could either naturally or strategically transition into a business use as well? I admit I've not stayed one. Is there any particular barrier to that as business people tend to choose smaller and smaller hotels, more unique properties over time?\nChris Nassetta: Listen, absolutely no barrier. I mean I emphasize the resort, because if you look at it as a percentage of their rooms and a number of hotels, a lot of them are in resort locations. By the way, there's over 500 hotels and growing. By the way, it's not like it's static, it's growing and we think we're going to help them grow at a much faster pace by being in our system. So we think this will continue to be 500, 600, 700 and continue to grow. There are plenty that are in urban locations around the world that are small luxury boutique hotels, just percentage wise, it's more resorts. But there's a very good representation in urban environments around the world and some really interesting urban environments that we don't have luxury exposure to. And so we absolutely believe that this is also crosses over into business transient. It will also drive some group business, but prototypically these hotels have very limited meeting space just by the very nature of what they are. I mean they have some boardrooms and small meeting spaces. So it will drive some meetings and events business, but I think it will be a lot of leisure and then -- first and foremost, and then business transient. But I think business transient will be a meaningful component of it, particularly in those hotels in the right locations.\nDavid Katz: If I can just ask about the locations geographically, what kinds of cities are in it now and where would they like to be, please?\nChris Nassetta: I think if you looked at the map, I mean, you can go on rather than me describing it, you can go on their Web site. I mean right now, it's sort of like 60% of it is in Europe, 20% in the US, 20% in APAC. The major cities in those markets, they have -- pretty much all of them have some representation. What you'll find if you went and then double clicked on that is that locations within those cities are pretty unique just because of what they are and where they are. So they're in niche super hard to duplicate locations within most of those major cities.\nOperator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I just had a quick question again, on the SLH. To reach the higher -- above the 6% unit growth that you said you're comfortable with, what sort of penetration would you need to reach within the SLH portfolio, I guess, in year one to get to the 6.25% or 6.5% growth that you mentioned with this potential -- with this partnership?\nChris Nassetta: We ultimately think the majority of SLH hotels are going to join our system and feel confident in that. The question is just going to be with all the technology and -- I mean all of which is being worked on because we've been -- we signed it recently, we've been working with them for quite some time. So the range of 25 to 50, which we feel comfortable, just has to do with how quickly we can get all -- execute against all of the technology requirements and the like. So again, as I said, we feel good about the high end of 5.5% to 6% without any of those. The quarter [indiscernible] will depend on just the speed of execution. And so next call, we'll try and give you -- we just signed the deal, teams are working hot and heavy on it. On the next call, we can probably try and refine it a bit, we'll have a better set.\nSmedes Rose: And just, Kevin, could you just share with us what the year-end share count was?\nKevin Jacobs: I actually don't have the actual share count in front of me right now, Smedes. We'll follow up with you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays.\nBrandt Montour: Just one more on SLH.\nChris Nassetta: We're excited about it, too. So happy to [Multiple Speakers]\u2026\nBrandt Montour: I mean, I guess the question is, when you think about those hotels coming in the system, and it sounds like they're all -- you think that they might all come at some point. But do they have to opt in? And sort of what is -- those individual hotel owners, what does the mechanism look like? I guess I would have thought of them all\u2026\nChris Nassetta: They have to opt in and we and the team at SLH have already started the process of communicating with them in that process, but they have the option to opt in. Now we think as does SLH, at least the owners that we've discussed with that it's a compelling value proposition for them to be opting in, which is why we have confidence that the majority of the system ultimately will come in. But they have the option to opt in or not.\nBrandt Montour: And so just to quickly follow-up on that. So these are hotels that went to SLH originally, because they wanted to keep their sort of whole specific brand, their own name and be very independent and you're basically allowing them to do that same thing by going [Multiple Speakers]\u2026\nChris Nassetta: We're allowing them to keep all of that, they're not branding with us. The SLH brand is maintained. So it's the same branding they've had. We're just giving them access to hundreds of millions of customers, a loyalty program all of our sort of commercial booking channels and the like, which obviously has proven to be, given the market share we drive in our system, quite a compelling value proposition. So we feel good about it for the same reasons we feel good about all of our development progress.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: So looking at your pipeline, your rooms under construction looks like it's back almost to pre-pandemic levels pretty much. So I guess I'm just wondering what percent of your 2024 unit growth are you expecting to come from conversions?\nKevin Jacobs: We think we did 30%, as Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks this year. We think it will be a little bit higher than that, sort of in the mid-30s for the year this year.\nRobin Farley: And I know you're not guiding to anything next year yet. But is that something you expect to accelerate as a percent of your unit growth over time or do you think that we're seeing that sort of mid-30% range this year will be kind of the most, and then it will return to more normal additional supply under construction?\nKevin Jacobs: I mean over time, it will depend on market cycles, of course, but I think as we -- particularly with Spark, which is 100% conversion brand, I think it will drift upwards over time and become an important part of -- it's always been an important part, but it will be a little bit higher over time. And then again, it will vary with market cycles over a longer period of time.\nOperator: The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: With respect to the 2% to 4% RevPAR guide, Chris, I know you walked through this from a segment standpoint, and it's obviously early in the year. In 2023, you guys exceeded [Star] results in each quarter. And for '24, I think [Star] has a slightly more positive outlook than you guys. So could you kind of maybe kind of square that circle in terms of your process versus maybe how [Star] would do it? And then, I guess, more importantly, should we expect the international RevPAR, I know it's FX neutral, to be more positive for you guys than domestically?\nChris Nassetta: I mean, as you would guess, we look at what all the pundits have to say, including Smith Travel, and that's interesting, but we do a ground-up process. I mean this is done by every individual hotel in the world, all 7,500 plus of them that then aggregates into us having a budget, and then we create a range around it. So that's the process we go through. Obviously, there's lots of uncertainty still on -- as we've talked about, we sort of tend always to take the consensus view, which right now is a soft landing. So there are a lot of different paths that the broader economy can take. But it feels, certainly, with what we're seeing in our business that, that is the most likely outcome. And so this is how we aggregated it together on a property-by-property basis. I would like to believe, and certainly, every year, I believe that I've been here in 16 years, we have grown market share, including last year, where we grew market share pretty nicely, and we are currently at the highest levels of market share we've ever had in our history. If we do our job again this year, we will grow market share again, which should mean that we would outperform whatever the market gives us. That is what we are trying to do. In terms of internationally, I think I said it in my comments, international is going to be a bit above the US, in part because you still have parts of Asia. One, EMEA is really strong, just basically strong, it's recovered and strong. And then you have parts of Asia Pacific that are still sort of recovering, notably the China market and the comparability benefits and that's really causing a slight overperformance in international versus US.\nChad Beynon: Looking forward to more of that at the Investor Day.\nChris Nassetta: Look forward to seeing everybody.\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.\nPatrick Scholes: This question is for Kevin. Just give us an update on how Spark is progressing. And then related to that, given the uncertainty surrounding what's happening with Choice and Wyndham, do you think that is helping with your conversion activity?\nKevin Jacobs: Look, Spark is going great. I mean, we've got nearly 150 of them in the pipeline already, and we just launched it last year. We've got another 250 working deals, something like that, so 400 working deals. We had eight or 10 of them open now that are performing really well. So we're picking up a lot of momentum. So we feel really good about the future of Spark and its value proposition. And I think I'm probably not going to comment on what our competitors might or might not be doing together. We believe strongly in the value proposition for Spark that's why we launched it, and we don't think that anything that goes on in the environment around us will change that trajectory or our ability to be successful in that segment.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I wonder if you could offer some thoughts on the trajectory you see from here on mid scale and below chain scales, still up meaningfully versus pre-pandemic, but a bit softer year-over-year. How do you interpret that? And is there anything you see on the horizon that could drive some acceleration this year on the lower end?\nKevin Jacobs: Look, I think some of it is comps, right? Those segments recovered really well and a lot more quickly from COVID. So some of it's year-over-year comps. So I think that you'll always have those, as cycles play out, you'll have those effects, and we really believe in the demand for mid scale. So you could have differences in year-over-year RevPAR growth relative to other chain scales. But in terms of serving tons of customers, we think there's 70 million customers out there in that chain scale or below. And then if you think about -- so for Spark, for mid scale transient, if you think about LivSmart for more extended sort of 30, 60, 90 day extended stay business, we feel really good about the demand profile over the long term and the ability to serve. As Chris said earlier, in one of his answers, serve more customers, bring new customers into the system, but more importantly, deliver great returns for owners and earn more fees. We don't do these things because of how year-over-year RevPAR growth will perform. Now like in these chain scales, we expect to generate premium market share and outperform the competition. But you're going to to continue to have year-over-year in RevPAR growth, and that's not why we do these things.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird.\nMichael Bellisario: Sort of a two part just first on development and signings, maybe where are you seeing the wins by brand, by region and kind of outside of the Spark momentum that you just mentioned. And then I guess, just specifically on Spark for the eight or 10 hotels. I know it's still early days there, but what are you thinking in terms of loyalty contribution and sort of earn and burn patterns from Honors members so far?\nKevin Jacobs: So at the beginning, I'd say, look, for the first part of it, Michael, the success has been pretty broad based. I mean 45% up in signings which was up 31% in the US and then obviously a little bit better than that outside of the US and we expect another record year in 2024. And that's just because our brands are performing, industry fundamentals remain good. So despite what people think about economic growth, you're going to be in a supply constrained environment here for a while. And in those environments, we take more share, right? We mentioned we've got one in five rooms under construction more than any other hotel companies. So we have a lot of momentum and owners want to affiliate with us. And then when you get into an environment where capital -- where lending is more constrained, right? Lenders want to see -- they want to lend to projects that are affiliated with our brands. And that's not just a US phenomenon that's around the world because lenders feel like they're more likely to get paid back. And so a lot of it's momentum, it's across all the brands and chain scales and across all the regions. And then the second part of your question, I think -- look, it is early days, it's only a handful of hotels. But I think so far, what we're seeing from the performance of the Sparks is in line market share premiums reasonable to strong loyalty contribution. We do think we're going to sign up a lot more new members with these hotels, because we'll bring new customers into the system. So it's not just a matter of were they a member before they booked but sometimes they book and they become a member while they're there. So I think it is early days but pretty consistent performance across the board there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Just going back to SLH. Firstly, is this the luxury lifestyle launch you've teased recently or is that still to come? And then related, I guess, when other companies have done these kind of partnerships, they've seen some criticism that hotels are joining the loyalty program but a lower percentage of their revenues being handed over to Hilton. So how are you going to stop hotels from choosing the SLH route into Hilton Honors rather than maybe joining LXR or Canopy, or one of the other brands where they would pay across all of their revenues, the fee percentage?\nChris Nassetta: The first on luxury lifestyle, no, this is not in lieu of that. We are still hard at work. I've made, I think, pretty clear for a long time, but much clearer lately that we intend this year to enter that space one way or another and we're hard at work. And I think you should expect sometime this year, hopefully sooner than later to see us enter that space. And we think that's something that is totally different than what we're trying to do with SLH. In terms of the value proposition of existing brands versus SLH, as I said in my earlier comments, I mean SLH is something very different than LXR, very different than Canopy, different than Waldorf, different than Conrad, different than everything we have in the sense that these are really very small luxury hotels in very niche markets in a lot of cases, but even within non-niche markets, very niche locations. And as a result, we do not believe that they are in conflict with or cannibalize anything else we're doing, just because -- I mean, I suggest anybody just go on the Web site, they got 500 plus, you can sort of get a feel for it. And I think we did huge amounts of work in terms of overlap analysis to make sure we understood that. I think you could very quickly understand that like this isn't consistent with anything else we're doing. It will be very -- what we do in luxury lifestyle will be very different. What we're already doing with LXR, our luxury soft brand is very different. Those hotels tend to be bigger, hotels, more meeting space and all of those things. So as I said, we're excited. It's very -- as big as we are at 7,500 hotels across all of these chain scales, it's really hard to find something that you would view as this complementary but we worked really hard to find that and we think SLH is that. So we do not believe that -- we believe it will bring in lots of new customers, serve our existing customers, as I said, really well, make them happier as they earn and particularly, they burn points and will not be in conflict either with our existing owners, but more importantly, not be in conflict with our existing growth opportunities and the brands that we already have on the brand park.\nRichard Clarke: Maybe if I can just ask one very quick follow-up. Just the gap between the 15% RevPAR growth in owned and lease and the 8% revenue decline, what's leading to that gap in that segment?\nKevin Jacobs: You're talking about the -- yes, it's almost entirely the impact of government subsidies last year in the fourth quarter. I assume if you're looking at year-over-year RevPAR relative to RevPAR growth, which is same store and the subsidies come in below the revenue line.\nOperator: The next question is from Bill Crow with Raymond James.\nBill Crow: Chris, I'm curious, there's quite a debate out there about inbound versus outbound, especially on the leisure side, you said you expect leisure to be up this year. I'm wondering what you're seeing in your system tells you that outbound travel is going to be as strong as last year, or if we're going to see more balanced playing field here in the United States?\nChris Nassetta: I think we're going to see a very strong -- a much stronger inbound year, that doesn't mean outbound is going to be bad. But I think with what happened with the value of the dollar last year and you had the strength there, drove a lot of international travel, particularly to Europe, I don't think -- and people hadn't been in a while, so you put those things together and it created a real groundswell for outbound business. I think there'll be plenty of outbound. But I think the trend this year will be sort of recovering not maybe fully but getting much closer to full recovery by the end of the year on inbound international. The Chinese inbound is the big variable, which is still a small fraction of what it was. I still think that takes a more protracted period of time, just given everything going on in China, but other countries around the world are compensating for that. So we might not get all the way back this year. I think TBD, but I do think for the story, part of the strength this year is going to be about inbound international. And I think part of that will obviously index very heavily towards the big urban markets. And that combined with what I already talked about on the group side, with the resurgence of all the big citywides and association as well as SMB group business that's everywhere, but that's nice for the big cities as well. So I think you're going to see -- I think that will -- when we finish the year, we're going to feel a lot better about inbound and not bad about outbound, but I think inbound will be the story.\nBill Crow: I do have a follow-up question, I'll make it quick here. But you a couple of times have kind of emphasized this low supply growth environment. The development pipeline continues to build. It's actually, I think, at all-time high levels. Your pipeline is a great example. I'm wondering if you're seeing any change in the pace of new construction starts or any indication that the period between signed deals and groundbreaking is starting to shorten? It feels like we got kind of a coiled snake out there, at some point, we're going to see some supply growth take off.\nChris Nassetta: I think you will. I mean, first of all, I mean, our numbers are really good and not to pat us on the back, but we take an unfair share of what is getting signed and an even less fair share of what's getting financed. So our numbers are not indicative of what's going on in the broader market. I think if you look in the broader market, the supply numbers are sort of circa 1%. And in my own view, you're right. Eventually, that will go back up. I mean the 30 year average is 2.5%. So it suggests if you look at long-term trends, it will go up, particularly as strong as the business has been and we think will continue to be into this year. But there are natural limitations in place, which is why you see it at 1%. I mean the 1% is sort of an output of very high cost to build and higher cost of labor, and higher interest rates, no financing availability that occurred over the last couple of years. And so you see that sort of hitting the numbers now. But the reality is while some of those things have stabilized, and that's why our starts were up double digit in the US last year, it's still very hard while financing. Interest rates have come down a little bit. Cost to build has not, but it's stabilized. Obviously, rates have gone up. I mean the economic setup works pretty well, but it really works, it\u2019s obviously really well for us because we drive very high market share and very high rates and higher than almost all of our competitors, so it works better for us. And the financing market, while it's better, okay, that's why we're able to get -- we got a lot more done last year, and I think we'll get a lot more done this year. It's not robust. And so there's a natural sort of gate that exist. And while it's getting better, I think will exist for a while. And it takes time to build these things, right? So the reality is, I think, this year, we'll still be not as constrained but more constrained financing environment that will weigh heavily to our benefit. And then I think it will continue to ease. But I think before you're going to see a lot of this stuff convert for and mass from a pipeline to under construction, particularly here in the US, I think it takes a couple of years, and then it takes a year or two to build the stuff. So I feel pretty darn good about like '24, '25 and probably most of '26 for being pretty meaningfully below the 30 year averages on supply, and that's why I made the comments that I made. I think it's just math. At some point, they got to start to finish.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Could you give us an update on how you're thinking about fee growth for the year? If you still expect it to exceed [indiscernible] plus RevPAR, and any kind of puts and takes there?\nKevin Jacobs: We still think -- we think fee growth will be a little bit above algorithm as it normally is. A couple of headwinds, a little bit of headwind from FX, but even with that, we think we'll be above algorithm for fee growth this year.\nKevin Kopelman: And then one other quick one. Could you talk about any plans or your plans to get back into the kind of 3 to 3.5 times leverage range that you talked about?\nKevin Jacobs: Our guidance this year implies we will be approaching the bottom end of that range. We still think it's the appropriate range for us. Obviously, the borrowing environment has been a little bit challenged. We haven't liked where rates have been. We're still -- obviously, our capital return is still moving up, and we've given guidance for this year. But the guidance for this year implies that we'll be approaching the bottom end of that range by the end of the year.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, everybody, again, for taking the time. Obviously, a really good year for us last year, some exciting things going on with SLH, but even the organic growth and increases in unit growth that we see, given the momentum we're taking from last year into this year. We feel really good about the progress of the company. We feel really good about where things are and outlook for the full year. And we'll look forward to catching up with you after the first quarter to give you an update. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system wide RevPAR grew 5.7% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong international performance and continued recovery in group and business transient. Adjusted EBITDA was $803 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better than expected fee growth, largely due to better than expected RevPAR performance and license fee growth. Management and franchise fees grew 12% year-over-year. For the quarter diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $1.68. Turning to our regional performance. Fourth quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 2% year-over-year with performance led by both business, transient and group. Leisure transient in the US was flat with difficult year-over-year comparisons. Relative to 2019 peak levels, US RevPAR increased 11% in the fourth quarter, improving 100 basis points versus the third quarter. In the Americas outside the US, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year with urban markets delivering RevPAR growth of 17% boosted by strong group business. In Europe, RevPAR grew 10% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments. Large events, including the Rugby World Cup in Paris, drove strong group performance across several key cities. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 12% year-over-year, led by strong rate growth. The COP 28 Climate Change Conference in Dubai, along with solid trends in Egypt, contributed to strong performance in the region. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR was up 42% year-over-year, led by continued demand recovery across China and Japan and notable strength across all segments. RevPAR in China was up 73% year-over-year in the quarter with RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region, excluding China, up 18% year-over-year. Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, for the full year, we grew net units 4.9% and ended the year with over 462,000 rooms in our pipeline, which was up 11% year-over-year with approximately 60% located outside the US and nearly half under construction. Looking to the year ahead, we are excited about our strong development story and the robust demand for Hilton branded products in both the US and international markets. Moving to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect system wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $690 million $710 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.36 and $1.44. For full year \u201824, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.33 billion and $3.38 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.80 and $6.94. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $158 million in dividends for the year. For full year 2023, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In the first quarter, our board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect to return approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks.  We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourselves to one question. M. J., can we have our first question please? I actually don't have the actual share count in front of me right now, Smedes. We'll follow up with you. We think we did 30%, as Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks this year. We think it will be a little bit higher than that, sort of in the mid-30s for the year this year. I mean over time, it will depend on market cycles, of course, but I think as we -- particularly with Spark, which is 100% conversion brand, I think it will drift upwards over time and become an important part of -- it's always been an important part, but it will be a little bit higher over time. And then again, it will vary with market cycles over a longer period of time. Look, Spark is going great. I mean, we've got nearly 150 of them in the pipeline already, and we just launched it last year. We've got another 250 working deals, something like that, so 400 working deals. We had eight or 10 of them open now that are performing really well. So we're picking up a lot of momentum. So we feel really good about the future of Spark and its value proposition. And I think I'm probably not going to comment on what our competitors might or might not be doing together. We believe strongly in the value proposition for Spark that's why we launched it, and we don't think that anything that goes on in the environment around us will change that trajectory or our ability to be successful in that segment. Look, I think some of it is comps, right? Those segments recovered really well and a lot more quickly from COVID. So some of it's year-over-year comps. So I think that you'll always have those, as cycles play out, you'll have those effects, and we really believe in the demand for mid scale. So you could have differences in year-over-year RevPAR growth relative to other chain scales. But in terms of serving tons of customers, we think there's 70 million customers out there in that chain scale or below. And then if you think about -- so for Spark, for mid scale transient, if you think about LivSmart for more extended sort of 30, 60, 90 day extended stay business, we feel really good about the demand profile over the long term and the ability to serve. As Chris said earlier, in one of his answers, serve more customers, bring new customers into the system, but more importantly, deliver great returns for owners and earn more fees. We don't do these things because of how year-over-year RevPAR growth will perform. Now like in these chain scales, we expect to generate premium market share and outperform the competition. But you're going to to continue to have year-over-year in RevPAR growth, and that's not why we do these things. So at the beginning, I'd say, look, for the first part of it, Michael, the success has been pretty broad based. I mean 45% up in signings which was up 31% in the US and then obviously a little bit better than that outside of the US and we expect another record year in 2024. And that's just because our brands are performing, industry fundamentals remain good. So despite what people think about economic growth, you're going to be in a supply constrained environment here for a while. And in those environments, we take more share, right? We mentioned we've got one in five rooms under construction more than any other hotel companies. So we have a lot of momentum and owners want to affiliate with us. And then when you get into an environment where capital -- where lending is more constrained, right? Lenders want to see -- they want to lend to projects that are affiliated with our brands. And that's not just a US phenomenon that's around the world because lenders feel like they're more likely to get paid back. And so a lot of it's momentum, it's across all the brands and chain scales and across all the regions. And then the second part of your question, I think -- look, it is early days, it's only a handful of hotels. But I think so far, what we're seeing from the performance of the Sparks is in line market share premiums reasonable to strong loyalty contribution. We do think we're going to sign up a lot more new members with these hotels, because we'll bring new customers into the system. So it's not just a matter of were they a member before they booked but sometimes they book and they become a member while they're there. So I think it is early days but pretty consistent performance across the board there. You're talking about the -- yes, it's almost entirely the impact of government subsidies last year in the fourth quarter. I assume if you're looking at year-over-year RevPAR relative to RevPAR growth, which is same store and the subsidies come in below the revenue line.

But the guidance for this year implies that we'll be approaching the bottom end of that range by the end of the year."

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are happy to report a great end to what was another really strong year for Hilton. For the year, system-wide RevPAR grew 12.6% versus 2022 with solid growth across every major region and chain scale compared to 2019, RevPAR increased 10.7%. Strong top line performance drove record adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.1 billion, up roughly 20% year-over-year to the highest level in our company's history. During the year, we launched two new brands, introduced new innovations, expanded our partnerships and opened a near record number of rooms, all of which further strengthened our network and enabled us to welcome more guests than ever before. Our strong top and bottom line performance drove significant free cash flow, enabling us to return $2.5 billion to shareholders. Turning to results for the quarter. System wide RevPAR increased 5.7% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations, driven by strong international and group trends. Group RevPAR rose 6% year-over-year due to an uptick in small company meetings and convention demand. Business transient recovery continued in the quarter with RevPAR up more than 4% [visited] by gains in both rate and occupancy. As expected, leisure transient RevPAR increased 3%, decelerating modestly versus the third quarter, largely due to seasonality. Compared to 2019, system wide RevPAR grew 13.5% in the quarter, up more than 200 basis points sequentially compared to the third quarter. Demand continued to improve with December system wide occupancy reaching 2019 peak levels. Group RevPAR outperformed expectations, increasing 8% versus 2019 and up more than 700 basis points sequentially versus the third quarter. Business transient continued to recover growing 5% versus 2019. As expected, leisure RevPAR remained strong growing 25% versus 2019 and decelerating sequentially due to calendar shifts. As we look to the year ahead, we expect system wide top line growth of 2% to 4% versus 2023. We expect performance to be driven by continued growth across all major regions with international markets modestly outpacing the US. We also expect positive RevPAR growth across all segments, driven by continued recovery in business transient and group coupled with steady leisure demand. We expect continued recovery in small company meetings and large association and convention business to drive strong group performance. For 2024, group positions is up 16% year-over-year with small companies meetings increasing as a percentage of mix, further demonstrating the value of small and medium sized businesses given higher rates and greater resiliency. Turning to development. We continue to see positive momentum throughout the year opening 24,000 rooms in the fourth quarter, marking the largest quarter of openings in our history. We achieved several milestones in the quarter, including the openings of our 250th Tru Hotel and our 1000th Hilton Garden Inn. We also reached 70,000 rooms globally for Home2. Additionally, we celebrated the opening of Signia by Hilton Atlanta, the city's largest ground up development in over 40 years. The property strategically located next to the Georgia World Congress Center and Mercedes-Benz Stadium features nearly a thousand rooms and over a hundred thousand square feet of meeting space, including the largest hotel ballroom in Georgia. For the full year, we opened 395 hotels, totaling approximately 63,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 4.9%. Conversion activity remains strong, accounting for 30% of openings and demonstrating the strong value proposition our system continues to deliver for owners. Full service and collection brands represented the large majority of conversions and continue to gain traction with owners. Both Curio and Tapestry open more hotels in 2023 than in any other year. Even with robust openings, our pipeline reached the highest level in our history, driven by record signings of 130,000 rooms, up 45% year-over-year and up 12% compared to pre-pandemic levels. At year end, our pipeline totaled over 462,000 rooms with roughly half under construction following a strong year in construction starts. For the full year, starts increased 15%, driven by the US. We continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company with approximately one in every five hotel rooms under construction globally slated to join our system. As we look to the year ahead, we expect continued positive momentum in signing starts and conversions to drive even stronger openings, boosted by our two newest brands, Spark and LivSmart Studios. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth to accelerate to the higher end of our 5.5% to 6% guidance range with the opportunity for further upside of 25 to 50 basis points from our exclusive partnership with Small Luxury Hotels of the World that we announced this morning. This partnership will meaningfully expand our luxury distribution as we expect to add the majority of their over 500 hotels to our system. Adding this extraordinary portfolio with a heavy orientation to resort locations to our already strong and growing luxury portfolio will further enhance a powerful network effect and give our guests even more opportunities to dream, book, earn and burn points, and we're doing so in a capital light way. The royalty rate will be in line with our existing brands, but fees will be paid only on the business driven through our channels. We expect over time to drive a meaningful portion of system revenues for SLH, and we'll start to integrate hotels into our system later this spring. Last quarter, we announced Hilton for Business, our multifaceted program designed to transform the travel experience for small and medium sized businesses by providing a new booking Web site along with targeted benefits designed specifically for SMBs. The program launched in January with thousands of companies registering in just the first few weeks. SMBs account for approximately 85% of our business transient mix and comprising meaningful and growing percentage of our group mix. Given its greater resiliency and higher rates, we think this important customer base provides significant opportunities to drive further growth. Overall, we remain focused on creating unique experiences in our hotels, including through innovative food and beverage offerings. We recently announced the launch of StiR Creative Collective, an in-house consulting and development arm that gives us the ability to work with our owners, operators and hotel teams to elevate food and beverage offerings to meet the evolving needs of our guests. Several noteworthy StiR projects have already launched at the Conrad Orlando, the Canopy by Hilton in Toronto and the new Signia in Atlanta. In a business of people serving people, our team members are at the heart of absolutely everything we do. We recently celebrated the remarkable achievement of being named the number one world's best workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This recognition follows eight consecutive appearances on the world's best list and marks the first time a hospitality company has achieved the top honor in this best in class program. Additionally, for the seventh consecutive year, we were honored to be included on both the world and North America Dow Jones sustainability indices, the most prestigious ranking for corporate sustainability performance. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance with our world class brands and powerful commercial engines driving a record pipeline and accelerating net unit growth. We're confident in our ability to continue delivering value for all of our stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.  Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to give a bit more detail on the quarter and our expectations for the year ahead. I'm happy to do that, Joe. I figured with all the rumor and all, I'd get asked this question. Obviously, first and foremost, you're right, I'm not going to comment on market rumors and speculation on anything specific. I would say my attitude, our attitude on M&A is really the same as it's always been. If nothing, we've been consistent and I've been consistent in what I've said. And that is we -- the fact is, as you point out, we haven't done any, but every time I've ever been asked for the last 10 years of being public, I've said never say never, but we have a very tough filtration system. And that filtration system at a high level is, number one, does something really -- is something additive from the standpoint of the portfolio of brands that we have. And from the standpoint of offering our customers, a product and experience that would be really additive to the family of brands that we have, number one. And number two, and importantly, can it be done in a way that's accretive to the value of the company. For the last 16 years, going on 17 years that I've been here, we've looked at pretty much everything. I've said that to everybody and nothing is passed through that filter. So that's the reason we haven't done anything. The environment we're in is a little bit different. There is, for a lot of reasons, interest rates and otherwise, more stress in the system than normal, that probably, I think, presents more opportunity to do things like this, but things that are quite modest in my view and that are what I view as sort of tuck-in acquisitions. Now I still think the filtration system is really rigorous. And obviously, we're not sitting here announcing any acquisitions. We announced a strategic exclusive partnership with SLH that we're very excited about, and I'm sure we'll talk about from other questions on the call. So that we don't have anything to report. And to the extent that we do, obviously, you guys will be the first to know. And so summary is we have no different attitude. We continue to look at everything but the stress in the environment maybe provides a little bit more opportunity than we've seen in quite a long time. I think broadly, if you look at the segments, and I said it at a very high level in the prepared comments, we feel really good about all the segments. Business transient continues to recover. I mean the big corporates finished the year still a bit off, probably 5% off of where they were, but still but growing, every segment in that world is a little bit different. I mean most segments were relatively strong and either back to or beyond prior to pandemic levels with the exception of probably banking, technology and consulting, which were less. But blended together, they weren't that far off. SMB segment is at or above, most of those segments are at or above. And when you blend all that together for the fourth quarter full year from a RevPAR point of view, business transient was ahead, but from an occupancy point of view was still a bit behind. We do think that by the time we finish this year, assuming sort of the broader consensus view of a reasonably soft landing that by the time we get to the end of the year, we think will be at more normalized levels of demand. And we believe given very low supply numbers that are continuing and continued decent economic growth that we're going to continue to have pricing power there and everywhere else. On the group side, I'll give you a snippet of like group position being up 16%, that's the best leading indicator. But anecdotally, sitting around this very table last week with all our teams from around the world and all of our commercial and sales leads, I've said it, the demand is off the hook. I mean the demand is really strong. Every quarter is the next new high watermark in terms of bookings for all future periods. So we are seeing very good strength. We believe the group demand is quite sticky in the sense that a lot of it still is pent-up demand that are things people haven't done for a long time that they need to do in addition to incremental new demand. You're obviously seeing in the group space, the big association, citywide business start to come back, that's super sticky business because of the time frames associated with the planning and the cost. So we think group will definitely lead the system. And as a result, you asked about rate, which I'll cover on both, we think rate will be very strong. Just there is so much demand and there's just a limited amount of space, if you think about it, not only is supply low broadly, but supply of hotels over the last 10 years that have been built that have a lot of meeting space has been [nimic]. And so you have a lot of demand -- I mean, I was sitting around this table yesterday, we're planning our own conferences for like sales conferences and general managers and all these things that we have to start going out three and four years, because we can't get space in our own hotels. So demand is good as a result with very limited supply, pricing should be good. And then on leisure, we do think it will grow. We do think probably more in rate than volume, because the consumer, particularly our consumer, which is our median income levels, reasonably good. It's in the 140,000 to 150,000 range. They still have plenty of money, plenty of desire to travel. And again, there's just not a lot of new supply. So the fundamental economic setup is good. Obviously, it got supercharged coming out of COVID, so it will probably -- we think it will grow more rate than volume, but it will grow. But it will be third in line after continued recovery starting with group then business transient, then leisure transient. So we feel really good about -- again, based on a broad consensus view that we have a rational sort of reasonably soft landing and continue to see decent -- slowing broadly, but decent economic growth in 2024. Correct. The 5.5% to 6% with a strong indication to the high end of that is pure organic. I said in my prepared comments, we think SLH depends on how rapidly hotels come in, which is why there's a range, 25 to 50 basis points on top of that. And if we were to do anything else, it's all on top of that. But that is the 5.5% to 6% were leading towards the high end of it is pure organic. Well, first of all, on SLH, as you hopefully could tell from my prepared comments, we're really excited about it. We've had a relationship there for a while. We've been working with them to figure this out and we're really excited to be able to get it done. I mean if you think about it, it's sort of like the moons and the stars aligned super well for us. We're going to be able to bring the majority of 500 hotels that are super unique, small, obviously, Small Luxury -- it's Small Luxury but very heavy resort orientation and very heavily oriented to very niche markets that are super hard to get into. And so when you look at it vis-a-vis the overlap of our existing -- we have 100 open luxury hotels, we have about another 60, 70 in the pipeline. So a terrific portfolio and growing super rapidly. When you look at the overlap, there is really none just because this is a really unique collection of hotels. We did a bunch of focus groups and customer research around this over the last year and really feel like this offering from the standpoint of our customers, particularly our higher end customers is going to be super well received in terms of their ability to bucket through our channels, but earn points, burn their points, go on their vacations in these places and the like. And so we think it is literally the perfect combination. And an unbelievable way for us to take what is currently 100 -- with pipeline 150, 160 hotel luxury portfolio and turn it into 600 or 700 scattered in all the best and most unique and hard to duplicate places around the world. So we think this is great. Customers, we think, based on all the work we did, are going to really love it, and we're excited to start ramping up including them in all our channels. In terms of the economics, we feel really good about it. As I said, we want to be really straightforward. I mean the license fees that we're getting are very similar sort of in the zone of what we would typically get in all of our -- with our direct brands. One difference in this case, as I said in my comments, we'll get paid on the business we generate, which we think will be significant. I mean it will take time to ramp that up, it will be significant. And that there's real economics in this for us as well. So we think sort of like, as I said, moons and stars, fabulous for the network effect, fabulous for our customers, and we think really good for shareholders in the sense that we'll be generating meaningful fees, and we are investing nothing, it's fully capital light. I think there are always -- I mean we're looking at lots of different things all the time. I mean since the IPO road show, we have talked a lot about network effect. I mean, very consistently trying to build that out to create an ecosystem that brings customers in and builds loyalty. And so we're always looking at other opportunities. And so I think there are possibilities in that regard. But nothing -- I would say, right now, we're focused on this. This is a lot of effort and work to get these built into the system. And we'll see, we'll see, anything that we think we can do to keep building -- bringing new customers in and giving them and our existing customers more products that resonate with them, that builds more loyalty and that we can commercialize in the sense of being paid for the effort we're interested in. But nothing more to report at this point beyond SLH. Listen, absolutely no barrier. I mean I emphasize the resort, because if you look at it as a percentage of their rooms and a number of hotels, a lot of them are in resort locations. By the way, there's over 500 hotels and growing. By the way, it's not like it's static, it's growing and we think we're going to help them grow at a much faster pace by being in our system. So we think this will continue to be 500, 600, 700 and continue to grow. There are plenty that are in urban locations around the world that are small luxury boutique hotels, just percentage wise, it's more resorts. But there's a very good representation in urban environments around the world and some really interesting urban environments that we don't have luxury exposure to. And so we absolutely believe that this is also crosses over into business transient. It will also drive some group business, but prototypically these hotels have very limited meeting space just by the very nature of what they are. I mean they have some boardrooms and small meeting spaces. So it will drive some meetings and events business, but I think it will be a lot of leisure and then -- first and foremost, and then business transient. But I think business transient will be a meaningful component of it, particularly in those hotels in the right locations. I think if you looked at the map, I mean, you can go on rather than me describing it, you can go on their Web site. I mean right now, it's sort of like 60% of it is in Europe, 20% in the US, 20% in APAC. The major cities in those markets, they have -- pretty much all of them have some representation. What you'll find if you went and then double clicked on that is that locations within those cities are pretty unique just because of what they are and where they are. So they're in niche super hard to duplicate locations within most of those major cities. We ultimately think the majority of SLH hotels are going to join our system and feel confident in that. The question is just going to be with all the technology and -- I mean all of which is being worked on because we've been -- we signed it recently, we've been working with them for quite some time. So the range of 25 to 50, which we feel comfortable, just has to do with how quickly we can get all -- execute against all of the technology requirements and the like. So again, as I said, we feel good about the high end of 5.5% to 6% without any of those. The quarter [indiscernible] will depend on just the speed of execution. And so next call, we'll try and give you -- we just signed the deal, teams are working hot and heavy on it. On the next call, we can probably try and refine it a bit, we'll have a better set. We're excited about it, too. So happy to [Multiple Speakers]... They have to opt in and we and the team at SLH have already started the process of communicating with them in that process, but they have the option to opt in. Now we think as does SLH, at least the owners that we've discussed with that it's a compelling value proposition for them to be opting in, which is why we have confidence that the majority of the system ultimately will come in. But they have the option to opt in or not. We're allowing them to keep all of that, they're not branding with us. The SLH brand is maintained. So it's the same branding they've had. We're just giving them access to hundreds of millions of customers, a loyalty program all of our sort of commercial booking channels and the like, which obviously has proven to be, given the market share we drive in our system, quite a compelling value proposition. So we feel good about it for the same reasons we feel good about all of our development progress. I mean, as you would guess, we look at what all the pundits have to say, including Smith Travel, and that's interesting, but we do a ground-up process. I mean this is done by every individual hotel in the world, all 7,500 plus of them that then aggregates into us having a budget, and then we create a range around it. So that's the process we go through. Obviously, there's lots of uncertainty still on -- as we've talked about, we sort of tend always to take the consensus view, which right now is a soft landing. So there are a lot of different paths that the broader economy can take. But it feels, certainly, with what we're seeing in our business that, that is the most likely outcome. And so this is how we aggregated it together on a property-by-property basis. I would like to believe, and certainly, every year, I believe that I've been here in 16 years, we have grown market share, including last year, where we grew market share pretty nicely, and we are currently at the highest levels of market share we've ever had in our history. If we do our job again this year, we will grow market share again, which should mean that we would outperform whatever the market gives us. That is what we are trying to do. In terms of internationally, I think I said it in my comments, international is going to be a bit above the US, in part because you still have parts of Asia. One, EMEA is really strong, just basically strong, it's recovered and strong. And then you have parts of Asia Pacific that are still sort of recovering, notably the China market and the comparability benefits and that's really causing a slight overperformance in international versus US. Look forward to seeing everybody. The first on luxury lifestyle, no, this is not in lieu of that. We are still hard at work. I've made, I think, pretty clear for a long time, but much clearer lately that we intend this year to enter that space one way or another and we're hard at work. And I think you should expect sometime this year, hopefully sooner than later to see us enter that space. And we think that's something that is totally different than what we're trying to do with SLH. In terms of the value proposition of existing brands versus SLH, as I said in my earlier comments, I mean SLH is something very different than LXR, very different than Canopy, different than Waldorf, different than Conrad, different than everything we have in the sense that these are really very small luxury hotels in very niche markets in a lot of cases, but even within non-niche markets, very niche locations. And as a result, we do not believe that they are in conflict with or cannibalize anything else we're doing, just because -- I mean, I suggest anybody just go on the Web site, they got 500 plus, you can sort of get a feel for it. And I think we did huge amounts of work in terms of overlap analysis to make sure we understood that. I think you could very quickly understand that like this isn't consistent with anything else we're doing. It will be very -- what we do in luxury lifestyle will be very different. What we're already doing with LXR, our luxury soft brand is very different. Those hotels tend to be bigger, hotels, more meeting space and all of those things. So as I said, we're excited. It's very -- as big as we are at 7,500 hotels across all of these chain scales, it's really hard to find something that you would view as this complementary but we worked really hard to find that and we think SLH is that. So we do not believe that -- we believe it will bring in lots of new customers, serve our existing customers, as I said, really well, make them happier as they earn and particularly, they burn points and will not be in conflict either with our existing owners, but more importantly, not be in conflict with our existing growth opportunities and the brands that we already have on the brand park. I think we're going to see a very strong -- a much stronger inbound year, that doesn't mean outbound is going to be bad. But I think with what happened with the value of the dollar last year and you had the strength there, drove a lot of international travel, particularly to Europe, I don't think -- and people hadn't been in a while, so you put those things together and it created a real groundswell for outbound business. I think there'll be plenty of outbound. But I think the trend this year will be sort of recovering not maybe fully but getting much closer to full recovery by the end of the year on inbound international. The Chinese inbound is the big variable, which is still a small fraction of what it was. I still think that takes a more protracted period of time, just given everything going on in China, but other countries around the world are compensating for that. So we might not get all the way back this year. I think TBD, but I do think for the story, part of the strength this year is going to be about inbound international. And I think part of that will obviously index very heavily towards the big urban markets. And that combined with what I already talked about on the group side, with the resurgence of all the big citywides and association as well as SMB group business that's everywhere, but that's nice for the big cities as well. So I think you're going to see -- I think that will -- when we finish the year, we're going to feel a lot better about inbound and not bad about outbound, but I think inbound will be the story. I think you will. I mean, first of all, I mean, our numbers are really good and not to pat us on the back, but we take an unfair share of what is getting signed and an even less fair share of what's getting financed. So our numbers are not indicative of what's going on in the broader market. I think if you look in the broader market, the supply numbers are sort of circa 1%. And in my own view, you're right. Eventually, that will go back up. I mean the 30 year average is 2.5%. So it suggests if you look at long-term trends, it will go up, particularly as strong as the business has been and we think will continue to be into this year. But there are natural limitations in place, which is why you see it at 1%. I mean the 1% is sort of an output of very high cost to build and higher cost of labor, and higher interest rates, no financing availability that occurred over the last couple of years. And so you see that sort of hitting the numbers now. But the reality is while some of those things have stabilized, and that's why our starts were up double digit in the US last year, it's still very hard while financing. Interest rates have come down a little bit. Cost to build has not, but it's stabilized. Obviously, rates have gone up. I mean the economic setup works pretty well, but it really works, it's obviously really well for us because we drive very high market share and very high rates and higher than almost all of our competitors, so it works better for us. And the financing market, while it's better, okay, that's why we're able to get -- we got a lot more done last year, and I think we'll get a lot more done this year. It's not robust. And so there's a natural sort of gate that exist. And while it's getting better, I think will exist for a while. And it takes time to build these things, right? So the reality is, I think, this year, we'll still be not as constrained but more constrained financing environment that will weigh heavily to our benefit. And then I think it will continue to ease. But I think before you're going to see a lot of this stuff convert for and mass from a pipeline to under construction, particularly here in the US, I think it takes a couple of years, and then it takes a year or two to build the stuff. So I feel pretty darn good about like '24, '25 and probably most of '26 for being pretty meaningfully below the 30 year averages on supply, and that's why I made the comments that I made. I think it's just math. At some point, they got to start to finish. Thank you, everybody, again, for taking the time. Obviously, a really good year for us last year, some exciting things going on with SLH, but even the organic growth and increases in unit growth that we see, given the momentum we're taking from last year into this year. We feel really good about the progress of the company. We feel really good about where things are and outlook for the full year. And we'll look forward to catching up with you after the first quarter to give you an update. Thanks again, and have a great day."

This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our third quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thanks, Jill, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I wanted to start today by saying that our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the tragic events that are unfolding in the Middle East. Our priority remains the safety and security of our team members and guests as well as helping in any way we can to support the relief efforts for the humanitarian crisis in the region through a number of organizations, including the International Committee for the Red Cross. Turning to results. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with system-wide RevPAR, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all above the high-end of our guidance ranges. The strength of our brands, power of our commercial engines and resilient business model continue to drive strong top and bottom line performance. This supports meaningful free cash flow generation and greater shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $1.9 billion to shareholders, and we remain on track to return $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for the full year. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 6.8% year-over-year, boosted by strong international performance and continued recovery in business transient and group. Demand improved across all segments and regions with system-wide occupancy for the quarter reaching our highest level post-pandemic and only two percentage points off prior peak levels with September just one point shy of 2019. Group RevPAR rose 8% year-over-year, outperforming leisure and business transient RevPAR growth of 5% each. Compared to 2019, system-wide RevPAR grew 11.4% in the quarter with all segments accelerating sequentially versus the second quarter. Overall performance was driven by both rate and occupancy. Steady rate growth and rising demand drove leisure RevPAR up 29% versus 2019, improving roughly 300 basis points versus the second quarter. Business transient RevPAR grew 7% with both large and small accounts improving. Adjusting for holiday and calendar shifts, mid-week RevPAR increased nearly 500 basis points versus the second quarter. On the group side, RevPAR exceeded 2019 peak levels for the first full quarter since the pandemic and we continue to see positive group booking trends in the quarter for all future periods. Group position for 2024 is now up 18% year-over-year, and lead demand in the quarter for all future arrivals increased more than 15%. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued strength in international markets, along with continued improvement in business transient and group demand to drive further acceleration in RevPAR compared to 2019. Better-than-expected third quarter performance and increased expectations for the fourth quarter, partially driven by better group bookings. As a result, we now expect full year RevPAR growth of 12% to 12.5%. Turning to development. We saw another quarter of robust signings with a near-record 35,500 rooms signed increasing 80% year-over-year. Our pipeline now stands at the highest in our history, totaling 457,000 rooms, up 4% versus the second quarter and 10% year-over-year.  Signings in the quarter spanned our portfolio, demonstrating the benefits of a diversified industry-leading family of brands. Conversions accounted for 35% of signings increasing sequentially versus the second quarter. Overall, we remain on track to deliver the highest annual signings in our company's history, surpassing 2019 record levels by double-digit percentage points. We also delivered another strong quarter of construction starts with every major region exceeding our expectations, and the US in particular, delivering its strongest quarter of start since Q1 2020, up 18% year-over-year.  Roughly half of our pipeline is currently under construction, and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company accounting for more than 20% of industry share. In the quarter, we opened 107 hotels totaling nearly 16,000 rooms, up 22% year-over-year and 12% versus the second quarter. We achieved several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 700th hotel in the Asia-Pacific region, and we celebrated our 60th anniversary in Japan. We also opened our 300th lifestyle hotel in our 50,000th lifestyle room, including the global debut of Tempo by Hilton designed with well-being in mind, the brand's first property is now open in the middle of Times Square, New York as part of the TSX development. Additionally, Canopy launched in the south of France with the opening of the Canopy by Hilton Con making Hilton's entry into the city and the latest addition to a growing portfolio of Canopy properties across Europe. Curio celebrated its debut in Savannah, Georgia. Tapestry increased its portfolio with the opening of the Bankers Alley Hotel in Nashville, and Motto expanded its signature flexible design and local vibe with its second hotel in New York City. During the quarter, we also celebrated the debut of our newest cost-effective conversion brand Spark by Hilton, the grand opening of the Spark by Hilton Mystic Groton in Connecticut solidified our foray into the premium economy segment. I just visited the property last week and was blown away. I would encourage any of you that are in the area to go see it. Opening just eight months after launch, Spark is the fastest announcement to market brand in Hilton's history, with more than 400 deals in negotiation; we think this is the start of a journey to reshape the premium economy segment while expanding our customer and our owner base. Announced just five months ago, Project H3 also continues to see tremendous demand with 350 deals in negotiation. In fact, later today, we're breaking ground on the first ever property in Kokomo, Indiana, which we expect to open in late summer 2024. Positive momentum in openings has continued into the fourth quarter with several notable openings in October, including the 540 room Hilton Cancun, Mar Caribe and all-inclusive resorts. Tomorrow, we'll announce and open a 1,000-room conversion property in the Northeast part of the United States. We forecast conversions will account for approximately 30% of full year openings. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of approximately 5%. We believe we have hit an inflection point and expect a meaningful uptick in openings in the fourth quarter with continued positive momentum into next year with forecast for our highest level of signings in the air, the largest pipeline in our history, nearing the largest under-construction pipeline in our history with identified 2024 openings and positive momentum in conversions, we are confident in our ability to accelerate net unit growth to 5.5% to 6% next year and to return to our prior 6% to 7% growth rate. In terms of fee contribution, our algorithm is alive and well, and we expect fee growth above RevPAR plus net unit growth going forward. Our under-construction portfolio mix of roughly 60% focused service hotels and 40% full service remains in line with our existing supply. This balanced and diversified pipeline, along with rising RevPAR and royalty rates gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering high quality growth with increasing fees per room. We also continue strengthening our value proposition for Hilton Honors members. In the quarter, Honors membership grew 19% year-over-year to more than 173 million members and remains the fastest growing hotel loyalty program. Members accounted for 64% of occupancy, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year. Demonstrating our commitment to meeting the evolving preferences of our guests, we recently announced several new innovations. As part of our long-term commitment to digitally transform the business travel experience for millions of small and medium-sized enterprises, we will launch Hilton for Business early next year. The multifaceted program will feature a new booking website along with targeted benefits designs, especially for SMEs, which account for approximately 85% of our business mix. Additionally, we will expand our events booking capabilities, enabling customers to book meetings and event spaces with or without guestroom blocks directly on our website. For travelers who prioritize sustainability, we recently announced an expanded agreement with Tesla to install up to 20,000 universal wall connectors at 2,000 hotels making our planned EV charging network, the largest in the industry. We also continue to be recognized for our culture. During the quarter, we were named the top hospitality employer in Europe and in Asia by Great Place to Work. And just yesterday, we were named the number one Best Workplace for Women in the United States for the fifth year in a row. The strong results we're reporting today would not be possible without our more than 460,000 team members who spread the light and warmth the hospitality each and every day. Overall, we're very pleased with the performance in the quarter, and we remain very optimistic about the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead with continued strong demand, coupled with our record pipeline and accelerating net unit growth forecast. We're confident in our ability to further differentiate ourselves from the industry in the years ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the results for the quarter and our expectations for the full year.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 6.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong international performance as well as continued strength in leisure and steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $834 million in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth largely due to better-than-expected RevPAR performance and license fee growth. Management and franchise fees grew 12% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.67, increasing 27% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to regional performance. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 3% year-over-year with performance led by continued recovery in both business transient and group. Leisure demand in the US remained strong even with tougher year-over-year comps. Relative to 2019 peak levels, US RevPAR increased 10% in the third quarter, improving 200 basis points versus the second quarter. In the Americas outside the US, third quarter RevPAR increased 11% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong group demand, particularly in urban locations. In Europe, RevPAR grew 11% year-over-year. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in business travel. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 19% year-over-year led by both rate growth and strong demand from the summer travel season. In the Asia-Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR was up 39% year-over-year, led by the continued demand recovery in China. RevPAR in China was up 38% year-over-year in the quarter and 12% higher than 2019. The rest of the Asia-Pacific region also saw significant growth with RevPAR, excluding China, up 40% year-over-year. Moving to our guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 4.5% and 5.5% year-over-year and 12% to 13% versus 2019 with continued sequential improvement versus the third quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $739 million and $759 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.51 and $1.56. For the full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth to be between 12% and 12.5%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.025 billion and $3.045 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.04 and $6.09. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $39 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, and we expect to return between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the full year. Further details on our third quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. MJ, can we have our first question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning, Shaun.\nShaun Kelley: Good morning, Chris. So Chris, I think the big incremental here is obviously your 2024 improving net unit growth outlook. I think this is meaningfully better than what people were expecting out there. So you gave some color in terms of what you're seeing on obviously, signings, starts and details. But just help us kind of dig in here a little bit. What would kind of give you the confidence to kind of bump that up from where we were a quarter ago? Is there something in particular you'd like to call out for us? And specifically, just remind us of exactly the activity levels you're seeing here US as we know we're fighting that sort of tougher construction and financing environment for owners broadly, it seems like you're obviously able to buck that trend. Thank you.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. Yes, last quarter, we gave a broad range of five to six, which we felt good about, but a broader range for obvious reasons, we were middle of the year, and there was a lot of year left and thus a lot of time to see what was going to happen in signings and starts and success with conversions and the like. And so -- as you saw from what we just reported on in Kevin's and my comments, we continue to have great success in the third quarter and that's continued in the fourth quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, we're going to have a record year by double-digit percentage on signings. While starts aren't quite back to where they were, they're getting close to being back to where they were. We obviously have an elevated level of conversions from what we've seen in recent years at 30%, which we think is going to continue with across a broad range of brands and of course, including the addition of Spark. And so the confidence we have is at this point in the year, we have a very granular model. This is -- we always have a model, but in the middle of the year, by definition, we just don't have as much information. Now, as I said in my comments quite briefly, we have identified -- a lot of what we're going to deliver next year is identified. Obviously, we have a bunch of conversions that we'll do in the year for the year, but we have a lot -- we've had a lot of success there. And so the confidence is ground up region-by-region, hotel-by-hotel with some, we think, reasonably conservative assumptions for what we'll be able to execute on given the momentum we have in conversions, this is where we end up is 5.5 to 6. And so we wouldn't say it if we didn't believe it and it is a plan that is based on the underlying momentum and things that are largely in production. As I looked at it, I know we get questions all the time about when are you going to get back to six to seven, and we obviously -- and I said in my prepared comments, I have every confidence we will. I think it's possible next year if a few things go our way. I think we could be at the bottom end of that range. But we're still in October 2023. So we're going to take it one step at a time. We refined it. We feel really good about 5.5 to 6, next time we talk, we'll ever find it even more. And as I said, a few things go our way. Honestly, when I look at all of the data in a granular way, I think there's probably more upside potential than downside risk at this point.\nKevin Jacobs: And then Shaun -- just to circle back to the US, I think, look, the story, I mean, you've heard the story about things are a little bit more stressed with financing costs. But I think the story around if you are financed and you're entitled and you're ready to go and you want to build a hotel, you're better off getting underway than leaving that asset as a non-performing asset. And I think that you think about that being fueled also by the fundamental environment where people are optimistic about growth, capacity additions are going to be constrained. We continue to take share. And so I think it's a good story in the US as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, just trying to understand, longer term, the accelerating net rooms growth. How -- on average, how long is the typical full service or the typical limited service hotels staying in the pipeline? Is that time line narrowing? I mean understanding next year's accelerating rooms growth is more a function of past periods gross room signings as well as starts that you're seeing pick up here. But are you seeing the time line room staying in the pipeline narrow at all on a like-for-like basis?\nChris Nassetta: No, I would say every region is a little different. I don't have a hard stat in my head. I'll give you sort of a directional answer. I mean with limited service in the pipeline generally in the pipeline a couple of years, full service, I would say, on the order of three or four years, but it could vary greatly depending on what region of the world you're in. But I think directionally, those are -- if I average it all together, those are pretty good. And I would say what happened during COVID is that extended out a great deal because everything stopped and slowed down and then you have the supply chain issues even after things got moving again, we reopened. You have the supply chain things that slowed things down. That has now come back down to being closer to where we were, but still a little bit more extended than where we were. And I think that has a lot to do with just in a lot of parts of the world, what Kevin just said. It's just a little harder to get things done. And so it's taking a little bit longer. People are getting financed, but if they had five projects they wanted to start, they're maybe getting two or three of those finance and it's taking a little bit longer. So I think there is a little bit longer gestation period. Now when 30% of the deliveries are conversions, obviously, that's a super short gestation period from pipeline into NUG. And so that's helping -- if you take it on average, I would say, with an increase of conversions relative to being in the low 20s right before we were in COVID. I would say the gestation period, the time and pipeline is about the same. Again, I'm doing sort of quick and dirty math in my head. But if you just look at pure new construction, it's a little bit -- it's still a touch longer than it had been. And again, we sort of like not to repeat myself, we factored all of that in, meaning we know we have a team that is on the ground everywhere in the world, working with all of our owners on every project that's under construction and what we think we're going to deliver next year other than the end of the year for the year, which are largely obviously conversions at this point. Those are projects. They're on the ground, they're being -- they're under construction, and we have rational time lines for when we think that those will deliver.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. Chris, you said earlier in the call that the kind of fee growth -- you expect fee growth to outpace kind of the NUG plus RevPAR dynamic. I was wondering if you could kind of break down a little bit how to think about the NUG plus RevPAR dynamic for the operating business relative to kind of the fees and whatnot and how we should think about that fee component of that relationship?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. We do get a bunch of questions periodically on like fees per room and they're going up and going down. I mean that's the reason we put it in there. And we'll give you a lot more granularity on that on March 19 of next year when we do a full day or a good part of a day talking about it. But we just -- we put it in there because we wanted to -- we get the question enough. I wanted to publicly how we think about it. I mean, we described years ago when we had our last Analyst Day sort of an algorithm that had same-store growth, new unit growth with leverage associated with fee -- license fee increases and that, that would ultimately give us same-store fee growth or fee growth that would be greater than the combination of those two. And that is the condition that exists today. That's what we see in the business today that as we model the business going forward, we believe that will continue as we look at the models. Why? Because of the things that are happy. We're getting same store. We're adding units, and we continue to see our license fee rates go up as we renew contracts. We have 5% of the system that's sort of on average rolling out every year and getting mark-to-market. And we're moving our -- on a bunch of brands. We're moving our license fees up. So when you factor for all of that, that's how you get it on our -- in our core RevPAR base. And then our non-RevPAR base fees as I think we've said a bunch of times, we're having great success. There's a bunch of different pieces of that. The two biggest pieces of it are our credit card, co-brand business and our HGVC HCV business, both of which we think, over time, will grow at higher than algorithm on average. And so when you put all that together, those are our fees. And that's why our fees, we believe, will be growing greater than sort of RevPAR plus NUG. And that obviously then translates if you just do simple math when you look at fees per room and you add RevPAR growth into that equation and you model it out over time, it's sort of hard if you make those assumptions not to fees per room go up. So people ask us that. We think -- I think the math is pretty easy. That's why we put it in there is just to sort of marker out there. Again, we'll give -- we're going to have -- the reason we want to have an Analyst Day is to do a bunch of different things, but that will be one of them to give everybody a little bit more granularity. But -- and an abundance of sort of transparency, we obviously always have our business model and we think the math -- the arithmetic is pretty straightforward and obviously compelling.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thank you. I was going to touch on key money a little bit, which went up a bit guidance for the fourth quarter, even as conversions are also going up. Can you just remind us of your general approach to key money and how the industry dynamics around key money have been evolving as we think about not only in 4Q, but beyond?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. So, Stephen, first of all, I'd say our overall approach to key money has been very consistent the entire time we've been here. We still have less than 10% of our deals that have any key money associated with them. I think you have to recognize that in a more competitive environment for conversions, those tend to be get a little bit more competitive and a little bit more expensive. But this year, what I would say is it's just we happen to have one -- we upped our guidance for overall CapEx, I should point out that, that's not key money guidance. That's overall CapEx guidance. We upped our guidance. We've been fortunate to win a few relatively large deals at the higher end of the business where they get a little bit more expensive in the fourth quarter. And we had one big deal, as we've told you about that carried over. It really was a last year deal, but didn't end up closing until this year, which caused last year to be lighter this year to be a little bit heavier. If you look at a three-year average we're sort of south of $250 million of total CapEx, the way we guide it. And I think that's the right way to think about it going forward. We think next year will normalize and be back into that sort of low 2s -- low to mid-2s range on a total CapEx basis.\nOperator: The next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning, David.\nDavid Katz: You covered a lot of details and in particular, the NUG acceleration into next year. If you could help us unpack a little bit. Is there some expectation for improvement in the landscape? And I know Kevin mentioned taking share of the opportunities that are out there. How? Is that a function of key money? I'd love to just get a sense for how you're pitching it and why you win?\nChris Nassetta: I would say, built in, I said this is a very granular for next year, it's a very granular analysis. So it's all in production or conversion. So I would say we do think -- the environment is not great, but not bad. I mean things are getting financed. Actually, in a really tough environment, as Kevin implied, we end up taking share. So, we're getting more -- much more than our fair share of the development opportunities. Why? I mean, I'm obviously partial, but I think if you talk to a broad base of owners, I would say because our brands perform better. Our market share is the highest in the industry. And if they're only going to do a few deals. They want to do them and get the highest returns, and so they go to the brands that are going to deliver their best performance. So, I mean, it's clearly it's still a challenging financing environment, although open and slow. We haven't made any big assumption to get to these NUG numbers for next year that something changes wildly. We think it's sort of going to my guess is it will matriculate and get a little bit better because there's a chance at some point next year, rates will come down things. So, we haven't really made that assumption, as I said, because we -- what's going to happen next year is largely in production. But we do think as has been happening this year and for a number of years that we will continue to take share. And we do believe and built into this is that on conversions, again, I said I think we'll be 30 this year. I think we'll be about 30 next year too that we are going to get more than our fair share of conversions. And we have enough momentum that I have the confidence to feel good about giving you the range and outcomes on that basis. And my guess is, as I said, if a few things go our way, we might be able to outperform that we've really definitely hit an inflection point of view. If you really think about the inflection point, it was sort of the second half of last year, you started to see the momentum shift and things bottom out in terms of signings and starts. And I kept saying this to people. I know everybody has been nervous, they're not -- for good reason. But you could -- we can just see like the rack moving through the SNC [ph] so to speak, starting the second half of last year, and now you're starting to see it produce. Third quarter is up a little. You'll see the fourth quarter, we're going to have a very large delivery quarter. And our belief, just given, again, what we know is in production is you've hit a real point of inflection and you're on the way back up. So that's a lot to unpack. I think the core answer is there is no broad assumption of like the world improving from the standpoint of development and financing in any material way from where we are here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead. \nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to go back to your comments around group business, which looks like it's pacing very well up for next year. And you mentioned as you have before, that 85% is coming from smaller business enterprises. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the remaining 15%, which I guess is comprised of larger businesses? And maybe just what you're hearing in terms of their sort of appetite to book into next year at this point?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. Thanks, Smedes for the question. I think you may be conflating two different comments. Group is way up 18%, group business on the books for next year. The 85%, I was talking about SMEs was business transient. It does turn out by coincidence that 85% of our group business is small and medium groups, but that's a total coincidence. And 15% of it is sort of large, I'd say, 300-room plus groups. As we look at next -- as you look at sort of implied, I think, in some of the comments I've already made or in the prepared comments, what's going to happen next year is that it will start. I still think group business has always been dominated by just like business travel, business transient by small and medium groups. But you will see the return of the mega groups that started in the second half of this year. It takes a long time to plan these things and think about it last year. Nobody wanted to commit them much because they didn't know we were still in the open close, open close. They got to spend millions of dollars planning these events, they can't get out of them, there's penalties and everything else. So, people waited a long time, and then it takes -- then they got to get a space and it's getting much, much harder to get space for these city-wides and the big groups. So that just takes time. I think it will shift next year not radically, but I think you will see a decent shift to an orientation to the large groups because they have a huge amount of pent-up demand that needs to be satiated. And so that's going to start happening next year. My guess is you'll see a big surge in it, it will shift the stats around. Over time, I think it's probably like -- I don't have a hard data point, but sort of directionally having done this a long time. I think it's like 80-20, something like that more normally. And so I think next year, you're going to get -- you're going to get more of that instead of 85%, 15%, you're going to see the bigger groups take a leap up in the short to intermediate term to get to a more normal environment. But we're seeing sort of underneath the question, I assume, is what are we seeing in strength from small, medium, big, whatever. We're seeing -- if we sat in this very room with our sales team as we do every quarter and went through it all. We're seeing strength in everything. Group is just off the hook, strong tons of demand, peak groups or lead times are lengthening because the obvious, right? Now everything -- there's not been a lot of group hotels that have been built in this country for essentially 20 years. And so you have all this demand, you have fewer places to go. So, groups have to start planning further in advance and booking much, much further out. And so -- the demand is very good. We've not seen -- notwithstanding a lot of noise in the environment about like where is the economy going and the like for next year. It's not -- we've not seen any real impact in terms of group demand at this point to the contrary. Our teams are saying they're doing everything they can to keep up with demand.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandt Montour: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Kevin, the fourth quarter RevPAR guidance looks strong, not out of the arena of your third quarter RevPAR growth. And you don't see that sort of translate into EBITDA year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter versus sort of the third quarter. Just wondering if there's timing you want to highlight between the two quarters or anything else and why that would be a little bit diverging?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, sure, happy to, Brandt. I think, yes, obviously, we raised our guidance about the amount of the third quarter. We did increase the top line for the fourth quarter a little bit, not huge, and it is flowing through, say, for there's a little bit of timing in corporate expense, a little bit of FX and then a small amount for Israel. That's really it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask returning to the topic of unit growth. The conversion percent next year, you said about 30% as well in 2024. Can you give us a sense of sort of typically in October of the prior year, how much of those conversions would be kind of already on your books versus how much would come in sort of in the year -- for the year you don\u2019t have as much visibility on just kind of understand the visibility there? Thanks.\nChris Nassetta: It's a great question, I wish I had a great answer. Every year sort of widely different I would say less than half, it's not nothing, but a lot of the work gets done in the year. But I would say, if I had to guess that it half, maybe a bit less would be 40% to 50% would be on the books one way or another or maybe not in -- it wouldn't be in the pipeline, but it would be in some form of negotiation. I would say 40% to 50% would be in some form of negotiation.\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone. The question about how you're thinking about upcoming corporate rate negotiations for 2024? Thank you.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. We feel pretty good about it. I mean we're in the -- just getting into the thick of it. We're never near done. Keeping in mind, it's a relatively small part at this point of the business. This is like 6% of our business given that we have really pushed hard on the SME side of the business, and that's 85% of the business. So when you whittle it down, it's about 6% of the business. But we think at this point, when you add it all together, the fixed and the dynamic, most of our pricing is dynamic at this point. It's probably in the upper single-digits.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Chris, I'll ask you to pull out your crystal ball for a second. Could you share some high-level thoughts on, which regions have the most RevPAR growth potential into 2024? Are you thinking maybe next year is more of a domestic growth driven year or more of the same with international leading? Does the regional leadership change into 2024?\nChris Nassetta: I think it will be -- I mean, I think it will be reasonably balanced between the US and Rest of World, maybe a smidge lower in the US than Rest of World, but not too terribly different, at least based on what we're seeing now. And then for Rest of World, I think we see positive growth everywhere, by the way. We don't see a region where we will not have growth. We're in the middle of budget season, so it's slightly premature to judge exactly where it will be. But if you said to me, where do we think it would be recognizing we're early in the process. I would say low to mid-single-digit global RevPAR growth. And we'll, obviously, on the next call, we'll give you a refined view when we have finished the whole process. But again, I would think that would be Rest of World a little bit higher, US, not too terribly different, and the one that would lead the pack again would be Asia-Pacific for a bunch of reasons, most notably China, which, if you recall, just in terms of comps, China did open up and is now doing really well, but the first part of this year was not. So, you will have a very strong start given everything that's happening in China in the business, which there's a lot of noise about China in their economy. But from a travel tourism point of view, in China, it's very, very strong now. We think that will carry into the beginning of the year, and then you'll have some easy comps. So, we think from a pure what will RevPAR year-over-year growth point of view, where would the regions be, I would say, China and thus, APAC will lead the charge. But they're going to - I would say, given we think it will probably be in the low to mid-single-digits, they're going to converge a little bit more. And now the world because China is open, is all -- you're getting out of sort of these COVID comp issues and you're getting almost to sort of a normalized world where you have comps where everybody was open from COVID other than, as I say, the first part of the year in China, the first part of 2024 comparability issue.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just in terms of occupancy versus rate discussion, I guess, more focused on occupancy. Chris, can you talk about how we should think about occupancy exiting 2023 as a percentage or decline versus 2019? And then more importantly, is there still a day of the week that just hasn't come back? Should occupancy permanently be a couple of hundred basis points off? Just trying to think about this in the medium term? Thanks.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, I said in the prepared comments that in Q3, we actually were only 200 basis points off. And in September, we were only 100. So I think we're going to exit this year getting closer and closer to prior levels of occupancy for the industry, but at least for Hilton. I think as we get into next year, particularly as we're able to build the group base, which is if you really look at what's happening and you're getting midweek business back, leisure is obviously still strong, weekends are still stronger than they were. What's really happened, particularly in a lot of the big cities in the US is you don't have the group base back. Well, you've seen recovery, you don't have that big group base to leverage the rest of the business off of. And as already commented, we think you're going to have a really robust group year just given where bookings are right now that then is, I think, sort of the last leg of the stool allowing you to get back to occupancy levels comparable to 2019. So, I suspect next year, we will -- as that -- as you go through the year and you get that group base back, I think the rest of the segments feel very good. I mean, I know everybody wants to say, nobody is going to travel for business, but that's just that people are traveling like crazy, look around and the makeup of there's some industries technology and financial services that haven't rebounded as much and have issues like over hiring and then reduction in workforce and all that. But again, the bulk of it is driven by SMEs and they're traveling more than they were. And most of the corporates and even those corporates the people they still do have are traveling more. So I don't -- I do not -- I do believe we will get back to prior levels of occupancy. I think it will happen next year. I think we're getting -- we're not quite there, but we're getting close. I think next year, as you think about the split between rate and occupancy, it's a little early, but I would say it's probably a pretty balanced equation as between the two next year. I mean, certainly, it's early look.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask on luxury. Maybe just remind us where is the white space today as you see it? And then maybe more importantly, what are your customers still asking for as you think about investing key money dollars at the higher end price point?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, I think that the white space for us is luxury lifestyle. We've talked about it a bunch. We are doing a bunch of work in the space right now. I think next year, we will come out -- we will have a product in the market next year. So we've done a lot of work over many years, but we sort of cranked up that engine once we got Spark launched in H3 out there. That's sort of next. I think our customers, listen, I think our customers love what we have. I mean, as reflected in the fact that loyalty is amongst the largest and is certainly the fastest growing. And I think we -- I know we still represent the highest level of engagement in the sense of Honors occupancy being higher than anybody in the industry. So, I think our customers are saying to us the ecosystem that you've created, both how you do loyalty, the products you have, the geography, what we talk about frequently, the network effect that we've built combined with Honors and experiences related to Honors and how they engage with Honors is really working well. So, I don't think there is anything that if I'm being really blunt that our customers are screaming out, I just sat in 12 hours of focus groups with customers because we're going through a strategic planning process for over two nights with every segment of customers, people are loyal to us, not loyal to us, et cetera, et cetera. There was -- I mean there's a lot to unpack there. I'm not going to do it on this call, but there was nothing that our customers were saying like, gosh, you need this and you need that. Look, what we do know is that having more on the high end creates even more of a halo effect. We believe we have a significant amount already in the luxury space, in the resort space. And given our scale and breadth and depth geographically, we think it's very pleasing to our Honors members. But on the margin, having more of it, we think, is beneficial, which is why we spend the time doing it. It's why we want to do luxury lifestyle. The other reason really not only do we want our customers to have more opportunities at the high end, but we're just giving away, if I'm being honest, we're just giving away development opportunities. I'm looking at Kevin, who runs development, too. It's like I travel all over the world. We have owners that are super loyal to us, and many of them want to build a luxury lifestyle hotel, and we don't really have a product for them. And so literally, they're doing it with other people just because we don't have a product, and that makes me crazy, so that I think that it will obviously enhance our growth rate. Now, luxury lifestyle is not like H3 or Spark or Tempo or Home2 -- it's not -- not -- it's a very bespoke thing. You're not going to have thousands of these. You're not even going to have hundreds of these. I mean, look at people who have been at it for a long, long time. You'll be fortunate to have dozens of them. But every room counts and having more really high-quality products in the right locations, we think continues to build our network effect. And so I've said this many times to many investors, I sort of love where we are which is we have a -- we have a network effect that works. We have 173 by end of the year, beginning of next year, we'll have 200 million Honors members that are very loyal to us. They love Honors. They love the network that we've created. They love the brand diversification, the geographic diversification. And so there is really doing luxury lifestyle is fabulous, doing more luxury deals with Waldorf, Conrad and LXR, we'll keep doing that. Those will add to growth, but there is -- the ecosystem works. I think point in case is the success that Honors is having vis-\u00e0-vis the competition. So, I look at these as all like incremental halo incrementally. Obviously, we can always make it better. And we can always add -- want to add products that add to our growth rate. And we think luxury lifestyle will.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Mr. Crow your line is open.\nChris Nassetta: Hey Bill, are you there?\nBill Crow: I'm sorry, Chris. Good morning.\nChris Nassetta: Good morning.\nBill Crow: Chris, Kevin and Jill. Quick two-parter on maybe the last question, I'm not for today.\nChris Nassetta: A lot in that question.\nBill Crow: Well, a couple of specific questions. First of all, the headlines surrounding Country Garden in China are getting any better. And I'm just wondering as it regards the pipeline as opposed to the already constructed and opening units, what do you think the risk is to that pipeline as you stand today? The second part of the question is more specific on the key money, and we understand the hotel you're going to announce the conversion on tomorrow is in Boston, the reports are circulating that's a $40 million key money payment. I'm just trying to figure out the economic state out of payment like that.\nChris Nassetta: Let me -- I'll maybe tackle both Kevin can jump in. On Country Garden, it is not a huge component of our overall pipeline yet in China. And so I don't feel like there's any risk. And certainly, the guidance we're giving you on NUG anticipates what we think conservatively will happen there. Having said, Country Garden obviously has a lot of issues, but this venture is a totally separate entity apart from their residential business. They remain very committed to it. They have very rigorous milestones that they have to meet in order to keep the exclusivity with Home2. And if they don't, we have all sorts of options that we could move forward on doing it ourselves, et cetera, et cetera. So, Home2 is very well received by the Chinese customer and very well received by the owner community recognizing Country Garden is not building any of these. This is a MOA, where we're going out with them, and these are franchisees that are doing it, and it's not their money. It's individual property owners, developers in all these little regions of China. And so it's not a capital drain for them. They like it. It's profitable, and I think they'll stick with it. If they don't, ultimately, we have all sorts of mechanisms. If they don't meet the milestones, it's not like we have to wait very long. I suspect they will -- what they're saying to me and to us is they remain very committed to it. So I think we -- I think it's fine. I think come to the key ingredient to it is super popular, super profitable on the ones that we've opened up in the development community just like I love Home2 in the US, the development community in China loves it. So that means that we're going to get a bunch of Home2s done. Hopefully, it's with them. If it's not, we'll do it ourselves. On the deal we talked about without naming it, we're not going to name it, we would have named it if we could. So we're not going to comment on specific deals and individual key money. The way to think about it broadly is on big, complicated city center, full service or luxury, those are the deals that end up drawing -- I mean being most of the key money we spend. As Kevin said, less than 10% of our deals and our pipeline by number have any form of balance sheet support. And disproportionately, it's those kinds of deals, they're more competitive, they're more strategic in certain locations where we may have lesser density of distribution where it's really important to us. And in every single case, we are making money. I mean, we are never giving key money, and I'm not going to comment on individual deals. We're never giving key money that doesn't have us make -- creating value in a contract that is significantly higher than the key money contribution. Obviously, that's -- we're a for-profit business. We just don't approach it that way. So every deal is profitable and 90%-plus of them are infinitely profitable because we put nothing into.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Thanks, everybody, for the time today. Obviously, very pleased with Q3, but more importantly, pleased with the momentum we have going into the fourth quarter, I feel pretty good about next year. We'll get back to you on exactly what we think as we get through our budget process. But given the macro view of what next year is going to be like and the pent-up demand, particularly in group, but also in business travel, we feel very good about it. And obviously, we talked a lot about NUG today. We tried to give you a much more granular view of that. We feel good that we've hit a point of inflection and we're on the road to getting back to our 6% to 7% growth rate. So we got a busy end of the year to make all that happen and get set up for next year. We'll get back to it, and we'll look forward to getting back with you after the year is over.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 6.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong international performance as well as continued strength in leisure and steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $834 million in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth largely due to better-than-expected RevPAR performance and license fee growth. Management and franchise fees grew 12% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.67, increasing 27% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to regional performance. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 3% year-over-year with performance led by continued recovery in both business transient and group. Leisure demand in the US remained strong even with tougher year-over-year comps. Relative to 2019 peak levels, US RevPAR increased 10% in the third quarter, improving 200 basis points versus the second quarter. In the Americas outside the US, third quarter RevPAR increased 11% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong group demand, particularly in urban locations. In Europe, RevPAR grew 11% year-over-year. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in business travel. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 19% year-over-year led by both rate growth and strong demand from the summer travel season. In the Asia-Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR was up 39% year-over-year, led by the continued demand recovery in China. RevPAR in China was up 38% year-over-year in the quarter and 12% higher than 2019. The rest of the Asia-Pacific region also saw significant growth with RevPAR, excluding China, up 40% year-over-year. Moving to our guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 4.5% and 5.5% year-over-year and 12% to 13% versus 2019 with continued sequential improvement versus the third quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $739 million and $759 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.51 and $1.56. For the full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth to be between 12% and 12.5%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.025 billion and $3.045 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.04 and $6.09. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $39 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, and we expect to return between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the full year. Further details on our third quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. MJ, can we have our first question, please? And then Shaun -- just to circle back to the US, I think, look, the story, I mean, you've heard the story about things are a little bit more stressed with financing costs. But I think the story around if you are financed and you're entitled and you're ready to go and you want to build a hotel, you're better off getting underway than leaving that asset as a non-performing asset. And I think that you think about that being fueled also by the fundamental environment where people are optimistic about growth, capacity additions are going to be constrained. We continue to take share. And so I think it's a good story in the US as well. Yes. So, Stephen, first of all, I'd say our overall approach to key money has been very consistent the entire time we've been here. We still have less than 10% of our deals that have any key money associated with them. I think you have to recognize that in a more competitive environment for conversions, those tend to be get a little bit more competitive and a little bit more expensive. But this year, what I would say is it's just we happen to have one -- we upped our guidance for overall CapEx, I should point out that, that's not key money guidance. That's overall CapEx guidance. We upped our guidance. We've been fortunate to win a few relatively large deals at the higher end of the business where they get a little bit more expensive in the fourth quarter. And we had one big deal, as we've told you about that carried over. It really was a last year deal, but didn't end up closing until this year, which caused last year to be lighter this year to be a little bit heavier. If you look at a three-year average we're sort of south of $250 million of total CapEx, the way we guide it. And I think that's the right way to think about it going forward. We think next year will normalize and be back into that sort of low 2s -- low to mid-2s range on a total CapEx basis. Yes, sure, happy to, Brandt. I think, yes, obviously, we raised our guidance about the amount of the third quarter. We did increase the top line for the fourth quarter a little bit, not huge, and it is flowing through, say, for there's a little bit of timing in corporate expense, a little bit of FX and then a small amount for Israel. That's really it. Yes, I think that the white space for us is luxury lifestyle. We've talked about it a bunch. We are doing a bunch of work in the space right now. I think next year, we will come out -- we will have a product in the market next year. So we've done a lot of work over many years, but we sort of cranked up that engine once we got Spark launched in H3 out there. That's sort of next. I think our customers, listen, I think our customers love what we have. I mean, as reflected in the fact that loyalty is amongst the largest and is certainly the fastest growing. And I think we -- I know we still represent the highest level of engagement in the sense of Honors occupancy being higher than anybody in the industry. So, I think our customers are saying to us the ecosystem that you've created, both how you do loyalty, the products you have, the geography, what we talk about frequently, the network effect that we've built combined with Honors and experiences related to Honors and how they engage with Honors is really working well. So, I don't think there is anything that if I'm being really blunt that our customers are screaming out, I just sat in 12 hours of focus groups with customers because we're going through a strategic planning process for over two nights with every segment of customers, people are loyal to us, not loyal to us, et cetera, et cetera. There was -- I mean there's a lot to unpack there. I'm not going to do it on this call, but there was nothing that our customers were saying like, gosh, you need this and you need that. Look, what we do know is that having more on the high end creates even more of a halo effect. We believe we have a significant amount already in the luxury space, in the resort space. And given our scale and breadth and depth geographically, we think it's very pleasing to our Honors members. But on the margin, having more of it, we think, is beneficial, which is why we spend the time doing it. It's why we want to do luxury lifestyle. The other reason really not only do we want our customers to have more opportunities at the high end, but we're just giving away, if I'm being honest, we're just giving away development opportunities. I'm looking at Kevin, who runs development, too. It's like I travel all over the world. We have owners that are super loyal to us, and many of them want to build a luxury lifestyle hotel, and we don't really have a product for them. And so literally, they're doing it with other people just because we don't have a product, and that makes me crazy, so that I think that it will obviously enhance our growth rate. Now, luxury lifestyle is not like H3 or Spark or Tempo or Home2 -- it's not -- not -- it's a very bespoke thing. You're not going to have thousands of these. You're not even going to have hundreds of these. I mean, look at people who have been at it for a long, long time. You'll be fortunate to have dozens of them. But every room counts and having more really high-quality products in the right locations, we think continues to build our network effect. And so I've said this many times to many investors, I sort of love where we are which is we have a -- we have a network effect that works. We have 173 by end of the year, beginning of next year, we'll have 200 million Honors members that are very loyal to us. They love Honors. They love the network that we've created. They love the brand diversification, the geographic diversification. And so there is really doing luxury lifestyle is fabulous, doing more luxury deals with Waldorf, Conrad and LXR, we'll keep doing that. Those will add to growth, but there is -- the ecosystem works. I think point in case is the success that Honors is having vis-a\u0300-vis the competition. So, I look at these as all like incremental halo incrementally. Obviously, we can always make it better. And we can always add -- want to add products that add to our growth rate. And we think luxury lifestyle will."

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thanks, Jill, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I wanted to start today by saying that our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the tragic events that are unfolding in the Middle East. Our priority remains the safety and security of our team members and guests as well as helping in any way we can to support the relief efforts for the humanitarian crisis in the region through a number of organizations, including the International Committee for the Red Cross. Turning to results. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with system-wide RevPAR, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all above the high-end of our guidance ranges. The strength of our brands, power of our commercial engines and resilient business model continue to drive strong top and bottom line performance. This supports meaningful free cash flow generation and greater shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $1.9 billion to shareholders, and we remain on track to return $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for the full year. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 6.8% year-over-year, boosted by strong international performance and continued recovery in business transient and group. Demand improved across all segments and regions with system-wide occupancy for the quarter reaching our highest level post-pandemic and only two percentage points off prior peak levels with September just one point shy of 2019. Group RevPAR rose 8% year-over-year, outperforming leisure and business transient RevPAR growth of 5% each. Compared to 2019, system-wide RevPAR grew 11.4% in the quarter with all segments accelerating sequentially versus the second quarter. Overall performance was driven by both rate and occupancy. Steady rate growth and rising demand drove leisure RevPAR up 29% versus 2019, improving roughly 300 basis points versus the second quarter. Business transient RevPAR grew 7% with both large and small accounts improving. Adjusting for holiday and calendar shifts, mid-week RevPAR increased nearly 500 basis points versus the second quarter. On the group side, RevPAR exceeded 2019 peak levels for the first full quarter since the pandemic and we continue to see positive group booking trends in the quarter for all future periods. Group position for 2024 is now up 18% year-over-year, and lead demand in the quarter for all future arrivals increased more than 15%. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued strength in international markets, along with continued improvement in business transient and group demand to drive further acceleration in RevPAR compared to 2019. Better-than-expected third quarter performance and increased expectations for the fourth quarter, partially driven by better group bookings. As a result, we now expect full year RevPAR growth of 12% to 12.5%. Turning to development. We saw another quarter of robust signings with a near-record 35,500 rooms signed increasing 80% year-over-year. Our pipeline now stands at the highest in our history, totaling 457,000 rooms, up 4% versus the second quarter and 10% year-over-year.  Signings in the quarter spanned our portfolio, demonstrating the benefits of a diversified industry-leading family of brands. Conversions accounted for 35% of signings increasing sequentially versus the second quarter. Overall, we remain on track to deliver the highest annual signings in our company's history, surpassing 2019 record levels by double-digit percentage points. We also delivered another strong quarter of construction starts with every major region exceeding our expectations, and the US in particular, delivering its strongest quarter of start since Q1 2020, up 18% year-over-year.  Roughly half of our pipeline is currently under construction, and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company accounting for more than 20% of industry share. In the quarter, we opened 107 hotels totaling nearly 16,000 rooms, up 22% year-over-year and 12% versus the second quarter. We achieved several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 700th hotel in the Asia-Pacific region, and we celebrated our 60th anniversary in Japan. We also opened our 300th lifestyle hotel in our 50,000th lifestyle room, including the global debut of Tempo by Hilton designed with well-being in mind, the brand's first property is now open in the middle of Times Square, New York as part of the TSX development. Additionally, Canopy launched in the south of France with the opening of the Canopy by Hilton Con making Hilton's entry into the city and the latest addition to a growing portfolio of Canopy properties across Europe. Curio celebrated its debut in Savannah, Georgia. Tapestry increased its portfolio with the opening of the Bankers Alley Hotel in Nashville, and Motto expanded its signature flexible design and local vibe with its second hotel in New York City. During the quarter, we also celebrated the debut of our newest cost-effective conversion brand Spark by Hilton, the grand opening of the Spark by Hilton Mystic Groton in Connecticut solidified our foray into the premium economy segment. I just visited the property last week and was blown away. I would encourage any of you that are in the area to go see it. Opening just eight months after launch, Spark is the fastest announcement to market brand in Hilton's history, with more than 400 deals in negotiation; we think this is the start of a journey to reshape the premium economy segment while expanding our customer and our owner base. Announced just five months ago, Project H3 also continues to see tremendous demand with 350 deals in negotiation. In fact, later today, we're breaking ground on the first ever property in Kokomo, Indiana, which we expect to open in late summer 2024. Positive momentum in openings has continued into the fourth quarter with several notable openings in October, including the 540 room Hilton Cancun, Mar Caribe and all-inclusive resorts. Tomorrow, we'll announce and open a 1,000-room conversion property in the Northeast part of the United States. We forecast conversions will account for approximately 30% of full year openings. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of approximately 5%. We believe we have hit an inflection point and expect a meaningful uptick in openings in the fourth quarter with continued positive momentum into next year with forecast for our highest level of signings in the air, the largest pipeline in our history, nearing the largest under-construction pipeline in our history with identified 2024 openings and positive momentum in conversions, we are confident in our ability to accelerate net unit growth to 5.5% to 6% next year and to return to our prior 6% to 7% growth rate. In terms of fee contribution, our algorithm is alive and well, and we expect fee growth above RevPAR plus net unit growth going forward. Our under-construction portfolio mix of roughly 60% focused service hotels and 40% full service remains in line with our existing supply. This balanced and diversified pipeline, along with rising RevPAR and royalty rates gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering high quality growth with increasing fees per room. We also continue strengthening our value proposition for Hilton Honors members. In the quarter, Honors membership grew 19% year-over-year to more than 173 million members and remains the fastest growing hotel loyalty program. Members accounted for 64% of occupancy, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year. Demonstrating our commitment to meeting the evolving preferences of our guests, we recently announced several new innovations. As part of our long-term commitment to digitally transform the business travel experience for millions of small and medium-sized enterprises, we will launch Hilton for Business early next year. The multifaceted program will feature a new booking website along with targeted benefits designs, especially for SMEs, which account for approximately 85% of our business mix. Additionally, we will expand our events booking capabilities, enabling customers to book meetings and event spaces with or without guestroom blocks directly on our website. For travelers who prioritize sustainability, we recently announced an expanded agreement with Tesla to install up to 20,000 universal wall connectors at 2,000 hotels making our planned EV charging network, the largest in the industry. We also continue to be recognized for our culture. During the quarter, we were named the top hospitality employer in Europe and in Asia by Great Place to Work. And just yesterday, we were named the number one Best Workplace for Women in the United States for the fifth year in a row. The strong results we're reporting today would not be possible without our more than 460,000 team members who spread the light and warmth the hospitality each and every day. Overall, we're very pleased with the performance in the quarter, and we remain very optimistic about the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead with continued strong demand, coupled with our record pipeline and accelerating net unit growth forecast. We're confident in our ability to further differentiate ourselves from the industry in the years ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the results for the quarter and our expectations for the full year. Good morning, Shaun. Yes. Yes, last quarter, we gave a broad range of five to six, which we felt good about, but a broader range for obvious reasons, we were middle of the year, and there was a lot of year left and thus a lot of time to see what was going to happen in signings and starts and success with conversions and the like. And so -- as you saw from what we just reported on in Kevin's and my comments, we continue to have great success in the third quarter and that's continued in the fourth quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, we're going to have a record year by double-digit percentage on signings. While starts aren't quite back to where they were, they're getting close to being back to where they were. We obviously have an elevated level of conversions from what we've seen in recent years at 30%, which we think is going to continue with across a broad range of brands and of course, including the addition of Spark. And so the confidence we have is at this point in the year, we have a very granular model. This is -- we always have a model, but in the middle of the year, by definition, we just don't have as much information. Now, as I said in my comments quite briefly, we have identified -- a lot of what we're going to deliver next year is identified. Obviously, we have a bunch of conversions that we'll do in the year for the year, but we have a lot -- we've had a lot of success there. And so the confidence is ground up region-by-region, hotel-by-hotel with some, we think, reasonably conservative assumptions for what we'll be able to execute on given the momentum we have in conversions, this is where we end up is 5.5 to 6. And so we wouldn't say it if we didn't believe it and it is a plan that is based on the underlying momentum and things that are largely in production. As I looked at it, I know we get questions all the time about when are you going to get back to six to seven, and we obviously -- and I said in my prepared comments, I have every confidence we will. I think it's possible next year if a few things go our way. I think we could be at the bottom end of that range. But we're still in October 2023. So we're going to take it one step at a time. We refined it. We feel really good about 5.5 to 6, next time we talk, we'll ever find it even more. And as I said, a few things go our way. Honestly, when I look at all of the data in a granular way, I think there's probably more upside potential than downside risk at this point. No, I would say every region is a little different. I don't have a hard stat in my head. I'll give you sort of a directional answer. I mean with limited service in the pipeline generally in the pipeline a couple of years, full service, I would say, on the order of three or four years, but it could vary greatly depending on what region of the world you're in. But I think directionally, those are -- if I average it all together, those are pretty good. And I would say what happened during COVID is that extended out a great deal because everything stopped and slowed down and then you have the supply chain issues even after things got moving again, we reopened. You have the supply chain things that slowed things down. That has now come back down to being closer to where we were, but still a little bit more extended than where we were. And I think that has a lot to do with just in a lot of parts of the world, what Kevin just said. It's just a little harder to get things done. And so it's taking a little bit longer. People are getting financed, but if they had five projects they wanted to start, they're maybe getting two or three of those finance and it's taking a little bit longer. So I think there is a little bit longer gestation period. Now when 30% of the deliveries are conversions, obviously, that's a super short gestation period from pipeline into NUG. And so that's helping -- if you take it on average, I would say, with an increase of conversions relative to being in the low 20s right before we were in COVID. I would say the gestation period, the time and pipeline is about the same. Again, I'm doing sort of quick and dirty math in my head. But if you just look at pure new construction, it's a little bit -- it's still a touch longer than it had been. And again, we sort of like not to repeat myself, we factored all of that in, meaning we know we have a team that is on the ground everywhere in the world, working with all of our owners on every project that's under construction and what we think we're going to deliver next year other than the end of the year for the year, which are largely obviously conversions at this point. Those are projects. They're on the ground, they're being -- they're under construction, and we have rational time lines for when we think that those will deliver. Yes. We do get a bunch of questions periodically on like fees per room and they're going up and going down. I mean that's the reason we put it in there. And we'll give you a lot more granularity on that on March 19 of next year when we do a full day or a good part of a day talking about it. But we just -- we put it in there because we wanted to -- we get the question enough. I wanted to publicly how we think about it. I mean, we described years ago when we had our last Analyst Day sort of an algorithm that had same-store growth, new unit growth with leverage associated with fee -- license fee increases and that, that would ultimately give us same-store fee growth or fee growth that would be greater than the combination of those two. And that is the condition that exists today. That's what we see in the business today that as we model the business going forward, we believe that will continue as we look at the models. Why? Because of the things that are happy. We're getting same store. We're adding units, and we continue to see our license fee rates go up as we renew contracts. We have 5% of the system that's sort of on average rolling out every year and getting mark-to-market. And we're moving our -- on a bunch of brands. We're moving our license fees up. So when you factor for all of that, that's how you get it on our -- in our core RevPAR base. And then our non-RevPAR base fees as I think we've said a bunch of times, we're having great success. There's a bunch of different pieces of that. The two biggest pieces of it are our credit card, co-brand business and our HGVC HCV business, both of which we think, over time, will grow at higher than algorithm on average. And so when you put all that together, those are our fees. And that's why our fees, we believe, will be growing greater than sort of RevPAR plus NUG. And that obviously then translates if you just do simple math when you look at fees per room and you add RevPAR growth into that equation and you model it out over time, it's sort of hard if you make those assumptions not to fees per room go up. So people ask us that. We think -- I think the math is pretty easy. That's why we put it in there is just to sort of marker out there. Again, we'll give -- we're going to have -- the reason we want to have an Analyst Day is to do a bunch of different things, but that will be one of them to give everybody a little bit more granularity. But -- and an abundance of sort of transparency, we obviously always have our business model and we think the math -- the arithmetic is pretty straightforward and obviously compelling. Good morning, David. I would say, built in, I said this is a very granular for next year, it's a very granular analysis. So it's all in production or conversion. So I would say we do think -- the environment is not great, but not bad. I mean things are getting financed. Actually, in a really tough environment, as Kevin implied, we end up taking share. So, we're getting more -- much more than our fair share of the development opportunities. Why? I mean, I'm obviously partial, but I think if you talk to a broad base of owners, I would say because our brands perform better. Our market share is the highest in the industry. And if they're only going to do a few deals. They want to do them and get the highest returns, and so they go to the brands that are going to deliver their best performance. So, I mean, it's clearly it's still a challenging financing environment, although open and slow. We haven't made any big assumption to get to these NUG numbers for next year that something changes wildly. We think it's sort of going to my guess is it will matriculate and get a little bit better because there's a chance at some point next year, rates will come down things. So, we haven't really made that assumption, as I said, because we -- what's going to happen next year is largely in production. But we do think as has been happening this year and for a number of years that we will continue to take share. And we do believe and built into this is that on conversions, again, I said I think we'll be 30 this year. I think we'll be about 30 next year too that we are going to get more than our fair share of conversions. And we have enough momentum that I have the confidence to feel good about giving you the range and outcomes on that basis. And my guess is, as I said, if a few things go our way, we might be able to outperform that we've really definitely hit an inflection point of view. If you really think about the inflection point, it was sort of the second half of last year, you started to see the momentum shift and things bottom out in terms of signings and starts. And I kept saying this to people. I know everybody has been nervous, they're not -- for good reason. But you could -- we can just see like the rack moving through the SNC [ph] so to speak, starting the second half of last year, and now you're starting to see it produce. Third quarter is up a little. You'll see the fourth quarter, we're going to have a very large delivery quarter. And our belief, just given, again, what we know is in production is you've hit a real point of inflection and you're on the way back up. So that's a lot to unpack. I think the core answer is there is no broad assumption of like the world improving from the standpoint of development and financing in any material way from where we are here. Yes. Thanks, Smedes for the question. I think you may be conflating two different comments. Group is way up 18%, group business on the books for next year. The 85%, I was talking about SMEs was business transient. It does turn out by coincidence that 85% of our group business is small and medium groups, but that's a total coincidence. And 15% of it is sort of large, I'd say, 300-room plus groups. As we look at next -- as you look at sort of implied, I think, in some of the comments I've already made or in the prepared comments, what's going to happen next year is that it will start. I still think group business has always been dominated by just like business travel, business transient by small and medium groups. But you will see the return of the mega groups that started in the second half of this year. It takes a long time to plan these things and think about it last year. Nobody wanted to commit them much because they didn't know we were still in the open close, open close. They got to spend millions of dollars planning these events, they can't get out of them, there's penalties and everything else. So, people waited a long time, and then it takes -- then they got to get a space and it's getting much, much harder to get space for these city-wides and the big groups. So that just takes time. I think it will shift next year not radically, but I think you will see a decent shift to an orientation to the large groups because they have a huge amount of pent-up demand that needs to be satiated. And so that's going to start happening next year. My guess is you'll see a big surge in it, it will shift the stats around. Over time, I think it's probably like -- I don't have a hard data point, but sort of directionally having done this a long time. I think it's like 80-20, something like that more normally. And so I think next year, you're going to get -- you're going to get more of that instead of 85%, 15%, you're going to see the bigger groups take a leap up in the short to intermediate term to get to a more normal environment. But we're seeing sort of underneath the question, I assume, is what are we seeing in strength from small, medium, big, whatever. We're seeing -- if we sat in this very room with our sales team as we do every quarter and went through it all. We're seeing strength in everything. Group is just off the hook, strong tons of demand, peak groups or lead times are lengthening because the obvious, right? Now everything -- there's not been a lot of group hotels that have been built in this country for essentially 20 years. And so you have all this demand, you have fewer places to go. So, groups have to start planning further in advance and booking much, much further out. And so -- the demand is very good. We've not seen -- notwithstanding a lot of noise in the environment about like where is the economy going and the like for next year. It's not -- we've not seen any real impact in terms of group demand at this point to the contrary. Our teams are saying they're doing everything they can to keep up with demand. It's a great question, I wish I had a great answer. Every year sort of widely different I would say less than half, it's not nothing, but a lot of the work gets done in the year. But I would say, if I had to guess that it half, maybe a bit less would be 40% to 50% would be on the books one way or another or maybe not in -- it wouldn't be in the pipeline, but it would be in some form of negotiation. I would say 40% to 50% would be in some form of negotiation. Yes. We feel pretty good about it. I mean we're in the -- just getting into the thick of it. We're never near done. Keeping in mind, it's a relatively small part at this point of the business. This is like 6% of our business given that we have really pushed hard on the SME side of the business, and that's 85% of the business. So when you whittle it down, it's about 6% of the business. But we think at this point, when you add it all together, the fixed and the dynamic, most of our pricing is dynamic at this point. It's probably in the upper single-digits. I think it will be -- I mean, I think it will be reasonably balanced between the US and Rest of World, maybe a smidge lower in the US than Rest of World, but not too terribly different, at least based on what we're seeing now. And then for Rest of World, I think we see positive growth everywhere, by the way. We don't see a region where we will not have growth. We're in the middle of budget season, so it's slightly premature to judge exactly where it will be. But if you said to me, where do we think it would be recognizing we're early in the process. I would say low to mid-single-digit global RevPAR growth. And we'll, obviously, on the next call, we'll give you a refined view when we have finished the whole process. But again, I would think that would be Rest of World a little bit higher, US, not too terribly different, and the one that would lead the pack again would be Asia-Pacific for a bunch of reasons, most notably China, which, if you recall, just in terms of comps, China did open up and is now doing really well, but the first part of this year was not. So, you will have a very strong start given everything that's happening in China in the business, which there's a lot of noise about China in their economy. But from a travel tourism point of view, in China, it's very, very strong now. We think that will carry into the beginning of the year, and then you'll have some easy comps. So, we think from a pure what will RevPAR year-over-year growth point of view, where would the regions be, I would say, China and thus, APAC will lead the charge. But they're going to - I would say, given we think it will probably be in the low to mid-single-digits, they're going to converge a little bit more. And now the world because China is open, is all -- you're getting out of sort of these COVID comp issues and you're getting almost to sort of a normalized world where you have comps where everybody was open from COVID other than, as I say, the first part of the year in China, the first part of 2024 comparability issue. Yes. I mean, I said in the prepared comments that in Q3, we actually were only 200 basis points off. And in September, we were only 100. So I think we're going to exit this year getting closer and closer to prior levels of occupancy for the industry, but at least for Hilton. I think as we get into next year, particularly as we're able to build the group base, which is if you really look at what's happening and you're getting midweek business back, leisure is obviously still strong, weekends are still stronger than they were. What's really happened, particularly in a lot of the big cities in the US is you don't have the group base back. Well, you've seen recovery, you don't have that big group base to leverage the rest of the business off of. And as already commented, we think you're going to have a really robust group year just given where bookings are right now that then is, I think, sort of the last leg of the stool allowing you to get back to occupancy levels comparable to 2019. So, I suspect next year, we will -- as that -- as you go through the year and you get that group base back, I think the rest of the segments feel very good. I mean, I know everybody wants to say, nobody is going to travel for business, but that's just that people are traveling like crazy, look around and the makeup of there's some industries technology and financial services that haven't rebounded as much and have issues like over hiring and then reduction in workforce and all that. But again, the bulk of it is driven by SMEs and they're traveling more than they were. And most of the corporates and even those corporates the people they still do have are traveling more. So I don't -- I do not -- I do believe we will get back to prior levels of occupancy. I think it will happen next year. I think we're getting -- we're not quite there, but we're getting close. I think next year, as you think about the split between rate and occupancy, it's a little early, but I would say it's probably a pretty balanced equation as between the two next year. I mean, certainly, it's early look. Hey Bill, are you there? Good morning. A lot in that question. Let me -- I'll maybe tackle both Kevin can jump in. On Country Garden, it is not a huge component of our overall pipeline yet in China. And so I don't feel like there's any risk. And certainly, the guidance we're giving you on NUG anticipates what we think conservatively will happen there. Having said, Country Garden obviously has a lot of issues, but this venture is a totally separate entity apart from their residential business. They remain very committed to it. They have very rigorous milestones that they have to meet in order to keep the exclusivity with Home2. And if they don't, we have all sorts of options that we could move forward on doing it ourselves, et cetera, et cetera. So, Home2 is very well received by the Chinese customer and very well received by the owner community recognizing Country Garden is not building any of these. This is a MOA, where we're going out with them, and these are franchisees that are doing it, and it's not their money. It's individual property owners, developers in all these little regions of China. And so it's not a capital drain for them. They like it. It's profitable, and I think they'll stick with it. If they don't, ultimately, we have all sorts of mechanisms. If they don't meet the milestones, it's not like we have to wait very long. I suspect they will -- what they're saying to me and to us is they remain very committed to it. So I think we -- I think it's fine. I think come to the key ingredient to it is super popular, super profitable on the ones that we've opened up in the development community just like I love Home2 in the US, the development community in China loves it. So that means that we're going to get a bunch of Home2s done. Hopefully, it's with them. If it's not, we'll do it ourselves. On the deal we talked about without naming it, we're not going to name it, we would have named it if we could. So we're not going to comment on specific deals and individual key money. The way to think about it broadly is on big, complicated city center, full service or luxury, those are the deals that end up drawing -- I mean being most of the key money we spend. As Kevin said, less than 10% of our deals and our pipeline by number have any form of balance sheet support. And disproportionately, it's those kinds of deals, they're more competitive, they're more strategic in certain locations where we may have lesser density of distribution where it's really important to us. And in every single case, we are making money. I mean, we are never giving key money, and I'm not going to comment on individual deals. We're never giving key money that doesn't have us make -- creating value in a contract that is significantly higher than the key money contribution. Obviously, that's -- we're a for-profit business. We just don't approach it that way. So every deal is profitable and 90%-plus of them are infinitely profitable because we put nothing into. Thanks, everybody, for the time today. Obviously, very pleased with Q3, but more importantly, pleased with the momentum we have going into the fourth quarter, I feel pretty good about next year. We'll get back to you on exactly what we think as we get through our budget process. But given the macro view of what next year is going to be like and the pent-up demand, particularly in group, but also in business travel, we feel very good about it. And obviously, we talked a lot about NUG today. We tried to give you a much more granular view of that. We feel good that we've hit a point of inflection and we're on the road to getting back to our 6% to 7% growth rate. So we got a busy end of the year to make all that happen and get set up for next year. We'll get back to it, and we'll look forward to getting back with you after the year is over."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.\nJill Chapman: Thank you, MJ. Welcome to Hilton's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the Company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our second quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us today. We're excited to report strong second quarter results with RevPAR, adjusted EBITDA and EPS exceeding our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter had a record $811 million, the highest single quarter in our company's history. Performance continued to be driven by solid fundamentals, along with continued share gains. Our industry-leading brands, strong commercial engines and powerful partnerships continue to strengthen our system and differentiate us from the competition while a culture of innovation continued to fuel additional growth opportunities. Despite macro challenges over the near term, we're confident in our ability to continue driving solid top line and bottom line growth and, in turn, growing free cash flow. Given the strength of our results thus far and our expectations for the rest of the year, we're increasing our guidance for return of capital for the full year to between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion. Turning to results in the quarter. System-wide RevPAR increased 12.1% year-over-year as strong demand drove continued pricing power across all segments. System-wide occupancy improved four points during the quarter to reach 77% in June, our highest level post pandemic. Business transient RevPAR remained strong, growing 11% year-over-year as trends continue to normalize. Leisure RevPAR increased 7% versus last year, driven by solid rate growth and despite more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Group recovery remained robust in the quarter with RevPAR growing 19% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, system-wide RevPAR grew more than 9% in the quarter with all segments performing well versus prior peaks and accelerating sequentially versus the first quarter. Stable demand and rising rates drove leisure RevPAR growth of 26% versus 2019 and business transient growth of 6% and group RevPAR was roughly flat versus prior peak levels and improved versus the first quarter. As we look to the back half of the year, we expect continued strength driven by recovery in international markets, business transient and group demand. On the group side, we continue to see very positive trends. Our bookings in the quarter for 2024 arrivals grew 30%, with group position now at 13%, up driven by the corporate segment. And our sales team saw the largest revenue bookings in our history for all future arrival periods. Based on all of that, we now expect full year RevPAR growth of between 10% and 12%. Turning to development. We signed more than 36,000 rooms in the second quarter, representing the largest quarterly signs in our history. Conversions accounted for nearly 1/3 of signings in the U.S. Signings in international markets doubled versus last year, accounting for roughly half of system-wide signings in the quarter, driven by strong momentum across Europe and Asia Pacific. In Europe, we signed agreements across 14 countries, including our first Tapestry Hotel in the French Riviera and our first Curio in Croatia. In China, Hilton Garden Inn continued to show tremendous growth since launching our new franchise business model. In the quarter, we signed approximately 3,700 HCI rooms in China more than 3x last year and accounting for more than 1/3 of our signings in China. Signings in America were up 20 in the Americas were up 25 year-over-year with strong interest in the U.S. despite tighter credit conditions. We've signed more than 50 true hotels year-to-date, representing the strongest pace since 2017 as the operating success of existing true properties is linked to a surge in new signings. Results were further helped by Spark with approximately 60 hotels signed and another 400 in negotiation just six months since its launch. Nearly all deals are conversions from third-party brands and half represent new owners to Hilton, with our first park scheduled to open in September and roughly 20 by year-end, Spark is well positioned to disrupt the premium economy segment while expanding our customer and owner base, especially in markets where there is no Hilton brand presence today. In addition to the strong start for Spark, we recently launched an inventive new extended stay brand in the U.S. Under the working title Project H3, the apartment-style accommodations are designed for guests booking 20 or more nights built with the staying power of Hilton's award-winning hospitality. We have received tremendous interest from owners and developers due to the strong market opportunity, cost-efficient build and high-margin model, and we currently have more than 300 deals in negotiation. Our system-wide pipeline now stands at a record 3,000 properties totaling approximately 441,000 rooms, increasing 7% year-over-year and 3% from last quarter. Following another strong quarter of starts, up more than 73% year-over-year roughly and over 40% year-to-date, roughly half of our pipeline is currently under construction. We have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company ensuring guests will have even more options to stay with us in the years to come. Specifically in the U.S., our under construction pipeline has continued to increase, up 15% year-over-year which will contribute to increased openings later this year and next. In fact, in the coming weeks, we're going to open nearly 2,000 additional hotel rooms in New York Times Square with the debut of our first-ever tempo by Hilton than a new tri-brand property featuring Home2 Suites, Hampton Inn and Motto. In the quarter, we celebrated several milestones, including the openings of our 2,900 Hampton Inn and our 600 Home2 Suites property, which remains one of the fastest-growing brands in the industry. Additionally, we surpassed 150,000 rooms in Asia Pacific, including the openings of the Hilton Okinawa, Miyako Island Resort in Japan and the Conrad Shenzhen, our first luxury hotel in China's thriving technology hub. We expect openings to accelerate as the year progresses given strong international and conversion trends and expect conversions to account for around 30% of openings. For the full year, we expect net unit growth of approximately 5%. With forecasts for our highest level of signings, the largest pipeline in our history and approaching the largest under-construction pipeline in our history, we expect net unit growth to accelerate to 5% to 6% next year and to return to 6% to 7% over the next couple of years. As part of our commitment to deliver exceptional experiences for guests, we remain focused on initiatives to drive increased loyalty and satisfaction. We know, for instance, that food and beverage experiences are an integral part of travel and want to ensure our hotels themselves are great dining destinations. We recently formed a first-of-its-kind partnership with the James Beard Foundation serving as the premier sponsor of the 2023 restaurant and Chef awards and continue expanding our partnerships with world-class talents such as Michael Mina, Jose Andres, Nancy Silverton and Paul McGee. Hilton Honors remains the fastest-growing hotel loyalty program with more than 165 million members, up 20% year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all major regions. Honors members accounted for 64% of occupancy in the quarter, up 2 points year-over-year. Hilton team members and our award-winning culture continue to differentiate our brands from the competition, just yesterday, our Waldorf Astoria Home2 and Tru brands were named best in category by J.D. Power for their respective segments in North America. Last week, Hilton was again named as a top employer for millennials for the sixth consecutive year. Since 2016, we've been recognized by Great Place to Work as the world's best hospitality company in over 60 countries. We're thankful for the great work our team members do to serve our guests around the world. We have incredible opportunities ahead to further position ourselves as the leader in hospitality, and we're very excited for the future of travel. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you a few more details on the quarter and expectations for the full year.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 12% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong demand growth in APAC as well as continued strength in leisure and steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $811 million in the second quarter up 19% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Performance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth, largely due to better-than-expected RevPAR performance as well as strong performance in Europe and Japan, benefiting our ownership portfolio. Management franchise fees grew 16% year-over-year, driven by continued RevPAR improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.63 increasing 26% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance. Second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 6% year-over-year with performance led by continued recovery in both business transient and group segments. Leisure demand in the U.S. remained strong but grew more modestly year-over-year due to tougher comparisons. In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 22% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong group demand particularly at our resort properties. In Europe, RevPAR grew 26% year-over-year. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, particularly from the U.S. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 30% year-over-year, led by rate growth and strong demand from our [logis] travel. In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR was up 79% year-over-year led by the continued demand recovery in China. RevPAR in China was up 103% year-over-year in the quarter, an 18-point sequential improvement from the prior quarter and 3% higher than 2019. The rest of the Asia Pacific region also saw significant growth with RevPAR, excluding China, up 52% year-over-year. Moving to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 4% and 6% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $790 million and $810 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.60 and $1.65. For full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth to be between 10% and 12%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.975 billion and $3.025 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $5.93 and $6.06. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $40 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And as Chris mentioned earlier, we now expect to return between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the full year. Further details on our second quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible so, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. MJ, can we have our first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Maybe the first question relates to your net unit growth target for this year, approximately 5% versus the 5% to 5.5% previously. Can you talk about what's driving that? I mean how specific to the U.S., is that -- can you talk about the rate of China development recovery? And then obviously, we all heard what your expectations are for next year in terms of net rooms growth. What gives you the confidence for that acceleration? And what specifically, whether it's brand or geographies is driving that acceleration?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, great question. And no, I'm not surprised that, that would be the first question. For the record, I think, on the last call, probably three different times I said around 5%. So the truth is, since our last call, I don't think our view has really changed much about where our NUG would be this year. And so it is what it is, it was always a bit back-end loaded. And the simple reason for that, Joe, is in the numbers. If you look at starts, what's been happening with starts, we had a big surge in starts in the second half of last year. Starts were up second half of '22, 40%. And if you look at what they are in the first half of this year, as I stated in my introductory comments, they're up 40%. So that means that a bunch of stuff is just translating into the second half of this year and into next year. And so it really is entirely sort of the timing of -- in the sequencing of how that happens. So, we thought it would be around 5%. We still think it will be around 5%. Our confidence in going back on the way back up, I do feel like -- if we look at the data, it's not just pure optimism, although everybody knows I'm an optimistic sort. I mean if you look at the data, as I already said, starts were way up in the second half of last year. They've been way up in the first half of this year we continue to see good momentum there. Same with signings, I mean, we expect, as I said in my comments, have a record year in signings relative to our prior peak and that -- all of those things are translating into both our optimism about the second half of this year being much stronger than the first half and 2024 being much, much better. It's a bunch of different things that are contributing to that. It's really all regions, even though arguably the U.S. credit conditions are -- make it more challenging. As I already said, we're still up year-to-date over the last -- over the trailing 12 months, 15% in starts. And we have some other nice things that are going to add to our growth here in the United States with Spark. We're only going to open 20 this year. You should assume we're going to open a lot more than that next year and Home3 will start contributing H3 will start contributing next year, probably not a ton, but that is a much more financeable product, even in today's environment because it's probably more apartment than it is a hotel. We are broadly having really good success on conversions and Europe, which had been slow, has really started to pick up. And Asia Pacific really led by China has woken up and the engines have not just restarted, but they're really starting to fire on many more cylinders, I wouldn't say it's all the way there yet, but in the second quarter and our expectation for third and fourth is we're going to start to get a very good momentum. And so that's why we feel pretty darn good on the NUG for next year. Obviously, for giving you a range, I would sort of direct you to the middle of it. If some things go our way and the world stays relatively stable, I think we can be mid-range of that or above, but it's a little bit early in the year to go quite that far. We'll, obviously, next quarter and the following quarter, we'll update you. But I think -- what I would say to people is, again, it's objectively based on things that success we're having in conversions, the success we're having in demand for Spark, conversions all over the world, Spark here. By the way, we will take Spark to Europe relatively quickly. And just what we have in the pipeline, I mean, almost half of our pipelines under construction more than anybody in the industry. And once they start, they almost always finish. So that pickup starting in Q3 last year is starting to pay dividends. And thankfully, the pickup in starts has continued everywhere in the world. And as I said, the world is a big place. So there's a little bit more pressure in the U.S. even though the numbers are still good but a lot less pressure in some other parts of the world that had been feeling it, which is the benefit of a big diversified global business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: I guess if we've covered the net unit growth side. Chris, I'll ask a little bit of the same around sort of the RevPAR outlook. I'd like to gear it to sort of incremental kind of changes or upside for the second half? Just kind of what's the biggest difference to kind of your prior outlook that gave you some confidence there? And then just any pressures or concerns you're seeing on the leisure normalization point. It's a question we take a lot and just kind of maybe update us on the latest you're seeing as we move through some of these really tough comps in the summer. How is behavior out there? And what's going better or a little worse than anticipated at this point?\nChris Nassetta: Yes, happy to. So yes, we moved our numbers up for the second half of the year and thus impacted the full year. That was set on the basis that we're just seeing better results. We -- as we say very regularly, we're not economists, so we try and take the consensus view of what's going on in the macro. The consensus view last quarter was that the second half of the year would see a little bit more meaningful slowdown. I think the consensus for you right now, I mean, you can pick somebody, but it broadly is that it's going to slow down, but it's more of a soft landing and later in the year and more into next year. And so when we factor for that and we look at the momentum, obviously, we've already booked a half a year and we look at what we have reasonable sight lines now into the third quarter, which we feel very good about. And as we look at the fourth quarter, we would probably say the macro views that things will slow. And so we've assumed that, but probably the macro view is that they saw a little bit less than maybe last quarter. And so when you flush all that through, it results in an increase in our guidance. Now there's possible upside if the fourth quarter keeps going like we saw in the second and what it looks like we're going to see in the third, there may be potential. But it certainly warrant increasing our guidance based on where -- what we've already booked for the year, what we see at a macro view in the late part of the year. I mean the interesting thing is like everybody wants to will the business backwards, but we don't really see it. I gave you the stats on leisure, business transient and group. I gave you some sense of where we have really good forward-looking information, which is really on the group segment remaining really, really strong. I mean, obviously, leisure is growing at a somewhat slower pace because of the comps, but I mean it's still way over the prior high watermarks and business transient keeps grinding up and getting better and the same with group. So, as I'm sitting here today, honestly, while we will take a macro view of later in the year because we're not economists, we're not seeing any signs of weakness. I know there's a lot of questions on the leisure business. I mean what I would say to you is like we're not seeing -- we're having it a wildly strong summer in leisure. I mean the only places where leisure has backed off a bit is where you would expect it, where it's normalizing from like crazy highs. It's still in those markets, which I'll talk about way over '19 levels. But I mean it's just sort of coming back, not even to earth, but sort of in our universe, I guess. And those are markets like South Florida, Hawaii, parts of Southern California where it was just like it was insane. But broadly, we have a very diversified leisure business. Broadly, we're not really -- again, other than comps being harder, we continue to see good growth, and we expect to -- and at least what sight lines we have in the business transient, talking to a bunch of customers, which I've done very recently. And certainly, our sales team talks to them all the time, and we got everybody together as we always do last week to talk about it. They're feeling quite good, particularly the SMBs, which is at this point, 85% plus of our business. They're traveling more. They're feeling reasonably good about soft landing in their business. And then group and there's pent-up demand there and group, there's still huge amounts of pent-up demand that haven't been released, as I said, we're -- we had the best booking quarter in our history ever in the second quarter and our position is great for next year. And you're still not where you're going to be with all the big associations because that was really driven by corporate group. So a bunch of the big association groups, I mean, they are booking, but that's multiyear booking cycles, that's still to come. And so we don't see weakness. Obviously, we're sentient and we know what the Fed is trying to do. We'll hear this afternoon, what the next steps are? I expect they are going to raise rates. But I do think we're probably getting to the end-ish of that tightening cycle. Inflation is coming down, some of the lag caters that will eventually come into the inflation numbers. Housing in particular, is definitely real time coming down and will eventually show up. And so, I do think -- we'll see. Again, I'm not an economist, but I do think consensus view is starting to center around a softer landing, maybe late this year or sometime next year. And that feels rational based on everything going on. And as I said, our business, we're not seeing any real cracks anywhere. And of course, the places in the world that had been lagging are now starting to like produce. So, the most significant lag everywhere was doing really well, but China -- and now China is eclipsing prior high watermarks and getting going on development, as I already said, but also operationally, eclipsing 2019 numbers. So not to be a [indiscernible], it all feels pretty good and if we can orchestrate a slowdown but a reasonably soft landing, I think the rest of this year is going to be very solid and in line or better than what we said. And I think next year will be a darn good year because I still think there'll be strength in leisure. But particularly, there'll be if you get a reasonably decent slowdown soft landing, you're going to have continued growth in business transient, particularly with SMBs, which is the vast majority of the business. And group is going to be pretty sticky because people just have to do some of the stuff and particularly in a soft landing environment, I don't think you're going to see a big change there, anytime soon. So, it's early. I'm not going to -- like, obviously, I'm not going to give guidance yet for next year. We're not it's sort of crazy to do that. We got a lot of year to see how things play out. But I sit here today, I feel quite good about the rest of this year. I actually feel quite good about as we later this summer, get into budget season, how we feel about next year. And that's reflected, as you not surprisingly. And the guidance we're giving the increase in our return of capital, I mean I think that should be read for what it is.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: I know you don't want to get 2024 guidance, but if we go all the way back to the split off, you had outlined this algorithm of 1% to 3% RevPAR growth kind of translating to 14% to 23% EPS algorithm with kind of 6% NUG. You're talking about the reacceleration of NUG basically in that range. But what other changes in the business should investors be thinking through as we compare and contrast that algorithm to today whether it's thinking about royalty rates or pipeline or other fees?\nChris Nassetta: I think that the algorithm stands. I mean -- and in fact, even -- by the way, while NUG has been a little bit lower, RevPAR has been higher. I mean it's a pretty perfect hedge, meaning -- we've been running a little lower on one a little higher on the other. My guess is it's going to flip around over the next couple of years. And as I said, we're going to get back to 6% to 7% and same-store growth is going to normalize. But we think the algorithm is alive and well and will deliver at those -- in those ranges that we've talked about as a result of increased growth rates from where we are, increased license fee rates, overall RevPAR growth, the deals that we've done on the licensing side, which generally drag us up because they're at or above algorithm growth rates. We feel very good about that algorithm that we laid out in 2016 that it's alive and well in producing. And as a result, we're producing today more free cash flow than we ever had in history, which is what allows us to return so much capital. Again, that will keep -- both of those things will keep going up as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: I wanted to talk about just the strategic philosophies around brands. You've been highly productive at launching brands and just observing that a lot of the growth has been sort of in the middle and mid-scale and limited service, et cetera. How do you think about launching stuff potentially at the higher end? Or do you not sort of want or need those? Or -- and just help us understand how you decide where to launch.\nChris Nassetta: Sure, David. Thanks. Really good question. So yes, I got here with Kevin and others about 16 years ago, and this company had brands that were pretty good, but not performing that well today, we have 22 brands. So we have, I think, really built a very powerful sort of engine of innovation to figure out what customers want, what segments we're missing and to give them more of what they want and do it with very high-quality brands and then deliver commercial performance that's winning performance and market-leading performance is that we attract lots of capital. I don't think we have a brand and we have some that are early, but I don't think we have a brand. I know we don't that isn't performing at -- either equal to or above everybody in the space. And so listen, I say that sort of patting us on the back because I'm very proud of that. Every company has different strategies. We think this strategy is a winning strategy because it delivers better products for our customers over time that meet the market in a modern context, and it's better from a return point of view because we're doing it with blood, sweat and tears and not investing capital. And so it's an infinite return and better for the customers is sort of how do you not like it. Many of those brands, not all, and I'll talk about that, have been in the mid-market. Why? Because that's the biggest opportunity. And so we're trying to serve any customer for any need to have anywhere they want in the world. But obviously, we have focused a lot on where the big markets are, where the big addressable TAMs are total addressable markets. And there's no way you could debate that every segment is important, but the mid-market is where the people are. I mean the big demographic trend in the world. I don't have to tell anybody on this call is growing middle classes all over the world, right? And that's where the money is and those people can afford mid-market hotels. And so when you wake up in 10 or 20 years, the bulk of the rooms growth in the world, that's the bulk of the money that's going to be made is in the mid-market. So that's why we have focused there. But we have not focused exclusively there. We've done a bunch of things in the lifestyle space, with Urban Micro like Motto, with Tempo with Canopy at the upper upscale lifestyle segment. And obviously, in the luxury space, we have made huge strides. I mean, Waldorf existed but wasn't really a brand and Conrad was not much to speak about. And LXR didn't exist. And so, we've gone from essentially a few hotels to 100 world-class luxury hotels with another nearly 60 in the pipeline. And by the way, I said it, but this morning, if you look at Bloomberg or whatever, Waldorf Astoria was ranked the number one luxury brand Eclipse Ritz-Carlton and customer satisfaction in North America. So, we're making really good strides there. And I think there are more opportunities. I would say, listen, we've talked about this for a long time. And the only reason we haven't done it is because we've had other market opportunities that we thought would drive, would serve more customers, drive higher growth and create more value for shareholders, but luxury lifestyle is definitely -- I mean, we're in and around the lifestyle segment, LXR, to a degree is sort of luxury lifestyle. But we don't have a pure hard brand in the luxury lifestyle. Yes, we will. I would say we're doing developmental work there. We want to give our babies spark and H3. While H3, we need to give a name, which we're close to. And then we need to make sure they become little toddlers and are successful but we're doing developmental work in luxury lifestyle. I would expect in the next year, we'll launch something in that space to sort of add to the three brands we have already in the luxury space to give us another shot on goal for luxury opportunities around the world. But the -- and so luxury and lifestyle are hugely important to us because customers like it, and we give them lots and lots of opportunities, but again, the big mass market opportunity every -- in every major market in the world, is the mid-market. And so, we are not ashamed of saying we are -- we have every intention to have the best brands in every market to serve mid-market because we think that's where the most money will be made over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years.\nDavid Katz: Understood, and if I can just follow up on one detail and if I'm over beating the horse, apologies. With respect to the NUG for the remainder of this year, I just want to be as clear as possible about whether there was some on tough comps pull forward or any projects that have slid into next year that are elevating.\nChris Nassetta: I'm not really. I mean not really. As I said in the last call, I said around 5%. And if you go listen to it, maybe three times I mean a little bit, although it's not meaning -- I mean, listen, we were hoping from the standpoint of the momentum that we have in Spark. We were hoping to have 50 hotels open this year, I think by the last quarter, we realized that, that wasn't going to happen. But we're going to have, as I said, we're going to probably have 20. There's no problem. I mean we have 400 deals in negotiation with hundreds more coming over the threshold. It's just -- and the supply chain stuff is now set up and moving. It was a lot of moving parts as we get set up. And so -- that probably has a teeny bit of impact. I mean 20 to 50 is a few thousand rooms, but otherwise, not really -- No. I mean, again, I said around 5%. I'm still -- we still think it's around 5.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, David, I think not to go too far on. I think I'd just add that there's a reason why we signaled last quarter, another quarter has gone by. So, the second quarter is sort of in terms of openings played out the way we were thinking it would, which is why we were signaling we weren't yet ready to adjust the official guidance. All we've done now is crystallized with a happy year in the books and have a year left that what we thought was going to happen in the second quarter happened. And then if you think about the momentum, I mean, Chris already talked about this, but the momentum in approvals and starts, I'd say, it was a better experience in the second quarter than we were expecting a quarter ago.\nOperator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you a little bit about occupancy levels. When we look at the U.S. data, and I think is true for Hilton versus 2019 is a reasonable sort of gap to prior peak occupancy levels or pre-pandemic occupancy levels. But it sounds like from what you're saying, you think maybe the continued improvement in group trends will kind of close that gap? Or is certainly be something else you're seeing? Or do you think it's just structurally lower going forward? Just kind of curious how you think that evolves over the next -- through the balance of the year and maybe just going forward?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. For us, it's been better than the industry. We're 3 or 4 percentage points off of depending on when you look at it off of peak occupancies. I think that you sort of noted some of the issues. I think part of it is happening because of the group. It's still -- our group is getting there, but it's still building. Part of it is -- and that's impacting a bunch of the cities, right, that have recovered a lot most of them. There are a couple of exceptions or one big exception, but most of the cities have recovered. But from an occupancy point of view, they're still off because they don't have the big citywide spec. So I do think it is partly the group. And then the other thing that's going on is, I sort of kid not to be a smartass about it, but part of it is in, right? So if you said to me, could we drive occupancy consistent with the prior peak. The answer is, yes, I could probably do it in the next couple of days, but it wouldn't be the right answer. Meaning, we are pushing hard on price because we've been obviously in a highly inflationary environment. And from the standpoint of trying to make our hotel owners the most money, that relative trade is the right trade, keep pushing price hard even though it might impact occupancy. The bottom line is better because the flow-through on rates a heck of a lot better than the flow-through on occupancy. So part of this is, yes, there's still goods coming back. You have business transient is still particularly the big corporates are only 92% back, part of -- and they'll come back no matter what they say, by the way, over the next few years, they'll come back. You heard it here. I'm telling you they'll come back. But a bigger part of it is, honestly, yield management strategies. I mean, we're really trying to push rate, and we don't want to give -- we're not as worried because it's a better outcome for every a better outcome for us, our owners make more money to drive higher margins.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandt Montour: Just a follow-up on that, Chris. Industry ADR growth has been tracking below inflation since April. Inflation is probably expected to ease further. And I know your pricing is based on supply and demand and you're pushing rate. And I'm trying to just reconcile those two forces as we look into the back half of this year, and maybe you could also just add in what your core SME or your core business transient ADR pricing growth is looking like and if that is in excess of inflation today.\nChris Nassetta: The answer is yes. I mean there is a tiny disconnect in timing. But I'd say the core pricing of our transient products, whether that's leisure or leisure transient or business transient is keeping up with inflation at its current levels. And obviously, we expect that to continue to come down. We feel good about the pricing power, again, with all the assumptions I already commented on about my view or the macro view that we've adopted for the back half of the year. And as we go into next year, and we think the broader environment is generally supportive for continued rate strength. I mean the one thing -- it's funny we talked -- I kid our team around here, it's like we've been living a little bit in bizarro world coming through COVID, obviously, and then in the aftermath, where you all be about fundamentals. That's all we would ever talk about on these calls. It all has ever talked about with investors, the fundamentals of demand, what's going on with demand and what's going on with supply. In the bizarro world, nobody talks -- nobody cares about supply. But we're now in a lie. I mean, everything is just getting reasonably close to a more normalized environment. prices are higher, okay, but that's just a broader reset that's happened throughout the entire economy, which I think unless you have broad disinflation, which it doesn't feel like that's happening anytime soon, that's sustained. And so you've sort of set a new water level, if you will, for pricing. And then eventually, in the very near term, it's going to get back to basic fundamentals, like what's going on with base demand and what's going on in supply. And I think the thing that doesn't get enough attention, like thankfully, as you can see in our starts and signings and NUG and our expectations for the future, we get a heck of a lot more than our fair share. But what's really going on in supply, particularly in the U.S. is anemic levels of industry growth that are sub if the 30-year average is 2.5%, it's running like 0.8% and it will be, and it's been running low. And given the environment, it's going to stay low. And so when you get to a more normalized environment, which is we're sort of morphing slowly into over the next year or two, you're going to find yourself in an environment where demand should be reasonably healthy if the economy is okay against a historically low supply side environment in the industry. And so, I think it's going to feel pretty good. And I think it's going to be another factor for sustaining performance and rate integrity.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Can you talk a little bit about the profile of your owners for new development and how that may be changing? With the signings activity you talked about in the second half of last year, first half of this year, any new trends or maybe some surprises you could speak to with respect to the organizations or the individuals that are investing in new development?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Duane, I'd say, look, no surprises really. I mean, I think Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks, I mean, I think half of the Spark owners are new to Hilton, right? And that's not a surprise to us when you're heading into a different segment you're heading into a different group of owners. And we view that as a positive thing, right? You're filling the top of the funnel with a lot more demand for the product going forward. You're diversifying your own base even further. I mean we've always had a really diversified owner base but we're diversifying it even further. And we're responding to -- if you think about -- Chris said before, when he answered David's question is like evolving the product base to respond to where the demand is, well, the owner base evolves in that same way, too, right? The capital follows the opportunities. And so, if we were living in a world not that long ago, where 70% to 80% of our deals every year were with existing owners, we're still doing the same absolute amount of volume with our existing owners. I have to assume, I don't have the stats in front of me, I have to assume we're doing more business with our existing owners, but then we're actually adding a whole lot more owners around the world. So, I think globally, we're down to like 50% or 60% of our deals are with existing owners annually. So, no surprises, but we view it as a huge net positive for the business.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. The other minor segment, I think that's well said, is on H3. I mentioned in my comments, it's a hybrid, and it's probably more apartment than hotel. We've been really excited about the institutional interest that we have from larger institutions that either want to develop or work with a partner and fund the development of large numbers of H3 just because of the cost to build the -- it's we think a 60% kind of margin business, and they really like the segment of demand and its existing profile and growth profile. So that's been not surprising because we -- when we were developing H3, that was our hope and expectation, but it's nice to see it come to life. I mean, as I said, we're negotiating 300 deals and that's not with 300 different people at this point. We barely opened it up. This is with a relatively limited number of very well-heeled more institutional type players. We will ultimately open the floodgates on H3 once we get it going. But it's been very nice to see.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Obviously, great news on the RevPAR outlook, I did have a question circling back to the net unit growth. You mentioned Spark, and maybe it sounds like some timing in China that was a little bit pushed out. But when we think about the strong start numbers that you've talked about, can you help us think about timing of interest rates are still moving up a little bit here? And obviously, some of those big increases in starts are due to sort of comping the pandemics, so there's that going on, making the comps look different than normal. I guess just trying to think about the timing from here in terms of the factors like what has everything do you think bottomed. It seems like maybe not yet in terms of -- with interest rates still moving up, but help us think about the timing of like rates moving up, starts being high, but -- and kind of where you see things bottoming in terms of that.\nChris Nassetta: Yes. Just for the record, in the signings numbers, then starts signings will be above prior high watermarks pretty materially, and starts will be about -- even though the comps are resi be about where we were at our prior high watermark. So, it's not just the benefit of comps. I'll let Kevin take the next part of it. But I mean, Spark, the beauty of Spark is it's a relatively low-cost entry product. And so, it doesn't really require a lot of financing.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Both Spark on H3 are more easily financeable products in this environment. So again, that's not why we launched those brands. We launched those brands because there's a ton of customer and owner and for the product. But if you think about the way it's playing out, it's sort of another example of diversification being a great thing. We have products that are more financeable. I think our lower-end products around the world are more financeable. And then I think I'd couple of things I'd guide you to as well. I think when you think about a tighter credit environment because not just rates, it's availability of capital, that's not a -- that's a Western world phenomenon. It's not just U.S., but it is highly concentrated in the U.S. Only 40% of our deliveries this year are going to be in the U.S., right? So it's a big world out there. We've got a lot of diversification. And I think that for all of the reasons we've given you, we think momentum can continue. And if you think about mean Chris talked about bizarro world on fundamentals. It's also bizarro world a little bit on development because it sort of starts with approvals you got to sign them, you got to get them in the ground and then they deliver, and that's all usually on a lag. And we've had COVID, and we've had a bunch of changes. But I think if you think about development being on a lag, it has to start somewhere. So, the outlook for approvals and starts bodes well for the future. The fact that we're rounding out the product base with more easily financeable products bodes well for the future, the fact that we have more limited service and lower-end products to deploy in emerging markets bodes well for the future. And it's not to say there won't be hiccups along the way, but we do believe that it's a progression back to normal, if you will, from here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bellisario: Wanted to go back to the new credit card deal that Amex announced on Friday, you guys didn't mention it. So maybe hoping you could provide any commentary or incremental fees or economics that you expect to receive? And then maybe what's new or different in this deal versus what you last signed in 2017?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I think, look, there's a fair amount of that is competitively sensitive, and we're not going to get into a lot of details, but I can sort of give you a sense for what's new and different. I think, look, the economics are a little bit better, which is as a result of the program just being better. I think our -- if you look at total spend in the program for this year, it's going to be about 2/3 higher than it was in 2019, right? So, we're growing the program massively. It's been a hugely successful partnership with American Express. We believe that those -- we've said -- we don't give you a lot of details on packet, and we apologize for that. But again, it's pretty sensitive competitively. It's been growing ahead of algorithm. We think it will continue to grow at or ahead of algorithm over time. It's a 10-year deal. I think a lot of people would have predicted the last time we did a credit card deal that credit cards were going to go somehow go away and be replaced by other forms of payments. I think it's quite the contrary. I think travel co-brand cards have become extremely successful and attractive products. They drive engagement across the system. It's not just about the economics on the card. And I think Amex feels the same way. So we're super excited about the deal and probably will stop short on too many more details than what we've already said.\nMichael Bellisario: Got it. And then just one follow-up, any incremental economics included in the increased full year guidance from the credit card deal?\nKevin Jacobs: I mean we've been assuming that we've been working on this for a while. So I think there's nothing new on that front.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chad Benyon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: I wanted to ask about the owned portfolio. The performance in the quarter recovered better than M&F fee portfolio, leading to some of the positive variance versus your Q2 midpoint EBITDA guide. Kevin, you noted, I think, strength in Europe and Japan, obviously, where you probably have some of the smaller concentration. But can you kind of help us think if the outlook has changed for this segment as we kind of look into the back half of the year, given how much improvement you saw in the second quarter, does that give you more confidence that you could see some margin improvement and just overall EBITDA growth year-over-year in the back half?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, no problem. Yes, there's a lot there. First of all, the whole portfolio is concentrated effectively in U.K., Ireland, Europe and Japan, so particularly Central Europe and Japan have been quite strong. There's no real sort of change in -- I mean, a little bit of year-over-year growth for subsidies last year. That's just a little bit of noise. I think basically, there's operating leverage in the business, right? Their own hotels, their leases, right? So there's even more operating leverage than a regular owned hotel. So they've been growing at a rate that is quite in excess of the overall fee business. As long as fundamentals stay growing, that will continue to be the case. And I think we -- our outlook for the segment is a little bit better now this quarter than it was last quarter because our outlook for Europe and Japan is better.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: Just on the two new brands, [Arch] and H3. Are those going to be enough to get U.S. now back up to 5% that the international business will [indiscernible] recovery factor 6 to 7. And then maybe just related to that, by giving us some big numbers on where you think Spark can do in the near term. If I go back to when Motto was launched now 60 hotels, I think you're 8 to 10, when you launched Tempo, you talked about maybe 20 to 30 having got a Tempo yet, but one coming through, just maybe what's different here versus maybe where -- what those brands achieved in the shorter term?\nChris Nassetta: Yes. Good question. I think the answer is yes on not just Spark and H3 in the U.S., but Home2 in the U.S., Hampton is growing in the U.S. I'll come back Tempo is just getting started. So I think the combination of all of those brands, the benefit of conversions in soft brands will get us back, I am confident to those levels. The difference between like a Tempo and Motto and Spark is night and day, honestly. I mean here's what happened at Tempo and Motto. We launched them about a day before the pandemic and they are all new build. I mean it's pretty much with both those brands. There are some adaptive reuse that will go on, but it is a vast majority of those -- our new builds. And so we got into COVID, there was no financing if everything slowed down. Those brands, I think, will do incredibly well. I think Tempo, we have I don't even have the pipeline number in my head. But as we open Times Square, we've got dozens of those under development around the country. We're getting ready to take the show on the road around the world and now that we're in -- even though the environment has some uncertainty in financing and all that, it's a heck of a lot better than it was in COVID. So, you'll start to see a great trajectory and Tempo, there's nothing wrong. Tempos are great, owners love it. It's just COVID got in the away. Basically saying same for Motto, Spark is a totally different thing. One, it's not -- we're not COVID. While there are challenges out there, it's 100%, 100% conversion brand. And it's basically taking hotels that are in much weaker brands and converting them into our system where there's huge opportunities for market share gains and it doesn't cost in terms of the quantum of money to do it, it's a relatively low ticket for owners to do it, thus, why we have so much interest. So I think the ramp on that will be much, much faster, and it's a very different thing. But I wouldn't diminish the opportunities in Motto and Tempo. They're going to -- particularly Tempo, Mottos, a micro hotel in just the biggest urban markets, we'll do a lot more of them. But I mean, Tempo will be a mega brand. It just got caught up in getting launched a minute before COVID.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I wouldn't connect -- is a shorter way of saying, I wouldn't connect too many dots. I mean the world is just different, and the brands, as Chris said, are different. And again, the beauty of Spark is you don't have to get a building built to do a Spark. It's all going to be buildings that are already built.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChris Nassetta: Thank you, MJ. Everybody, we appreciate as we always do, you spending a little bit of your morning with us. We know it's a busy time and lots of earnings releases. We obviously remain really optimistic. Obviously, Q2 was a great quarter for us. That's flowing through plus some given our expectations for the second half of the year. Again, we're optimistic on our unit growth and optimistic for not just the end of this year, but in the next year, we'll be able to deliver. But most importantly, the algorithm that we've described is alive and well and working and we continue to grow. We continue to maintain incredible cost discipline. The Company is at the highest margins by 800 basis points ever run at, thus producing the greatest amount of free cash flow in our history, and we intend to be super disciplined about how we allocate that otherwise known as giving it back to our shareholders. And so in any event, we'll look forward after Q3, giving you an update on how everything is going. I hope everybody has a great rest of the summer.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 12% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong demand growth in APAC as well as continued strength in leisure and steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $811 million in the second quarter up 19% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Performance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth, largely due to better-than-expected RevPAR performance as well as strong performance in Europe and Japan, benefiting our ownership portfolio. Management franchise fees grew 16% year-over-year, driven by continued RevPAR improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.63 increasing 26% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance. Second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 6% year-over-year with performance led by continued recovery in both business transient and group segments. Leisure demand in the U.S. remained strong but grew more modestly year-over-year due to tougher comparisons. In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 22% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong group demand particularly at our resort properties. In Europe, RevPAR grew 26% year-over-year. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, particularly from the U.S. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 30% year-over-year, led by rate growth and strong demand from our [logis] travel. In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR was up 79% year-over-year led by the continued demand recovery in China. RevPAR in China was up 103% year-over-year in the quarter, an 18-point sequential improvement from the prior quarter and 3% higher than 2019. The rest of the Asia Pacific region also saw significant growth with RevPAR, excluding China, up 52% year-over-year. Moving to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 4% and 6% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $790 million and $810 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.60 and $1.65. For full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth to be between 10% and 12%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.975 billion and $3.025 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $5.93 and $6.06. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $40 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And as Chris mentioned earlier, we now expect to return between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the full year. Further details on our second quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible so, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. MJ, can we have our first question, please? Yes, David, I think not to go too far on. I think I'd just add that there's a reason why we signaled last quarter, another quarter has gone by. So, the second quarter is sort of in terms of openings played out the way we were thinking it would, which is why we were signaling we weren't yet ready to adjust the official guidance. All we've done now is crystallized with a happy year in the books and have a year left that what we thought was going to happen in the second quarter happened. And then if you think about the momentum, I mean, Chris already talked about this, but the momentum in approvals and starts, I'd say, it was a better experience in the second quarter than we were expecting a quarter ago. Yes, Duane, I'd say, look, no surprises really. I mean, I think Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks, I mean, I think half of the Spark owners are new to Hilton, right? And that's not a surprise to us when you're heading into a different segment you're heading into a different group of owners. And we view that as a positive thing, right? You're filling the top of the funnel with a lot more demand for the product going forward. You're diversifying your own base even further. I mean we've always had a really diversified owner base but we're diversifying it even further. And we're responding to -- if you think about -- Chris said before, when he answered David's question is like evolving the product base to respond to where the demand is, well, the owner base evolves in that same way, too, right? The capital follows the opportunities. And so, if we were living in a world not that long ago, where 70% to 80% of our deals every year were with existing owners, we're still doing the same absolute amount of volume with our existing owners. I have to assume, I don't have the stats in front of me, I have to assume we're doing more business with our existing owners, but then we're actually adding a whole lot more owners around the world. So, I think globally, we're down to like 50% or 60% of our deals are with existing owners annually. So, no surprises, but we view it as a huge net positive for the business. Yes. Both Spark on H3 are more easily financeable products in this environment. So again, that's not why we launched those brands. We launched those brands because there's a ton of customer and owner and for the product. But if you think about the way it's playing out, it's sort of another example of diversification being a great thing. We have products that are more financeable. I think our lower-end products around the world are more financeable. And then I think I'd couple of things I'd guide you to as well. I think when you think about a tighter credit environment because not just rates, it's availability of capital, that's not a -- that's a Western world phenomenon. It's not just U.S., but it is highly concentrated in the U.S. Only 40% of our deliveries this year are going to be in the U.S., right? So it's a big world out there. We've got a lot of diversification. And I think that for all of the reasons we've given you, we think momentum can continue. And if you think about mean Chris talked about bizarro world on fundamentals. It's also bizarro world a little bit on development because it sort of starts with approvals you got to sign them, you got to get them in the ground and then they deliver, and that's all usually on a lag. And we've had COVID, and we've had a bunch of changes. But I think if you think about development being on a lag, it has to start somewhere. So, the outlook for approvals and starts bodes well for the future. The fact that we're rounding out the product base with more easily financeable products bodes well for the future, the fact that we have more limited service and lower-end products to deploy in emerging markets bodes well for the future. And it's not to say there won't be hiccups along the way, but we do believe that it's a progression back to normal, if you will, from here. Yes. I think, look, there's a fair amount of that is competitively sensitive, and we're not going to get into a lot of details, but I can sort of give you a sense for what's new and different. I think, look, the economics are a little bit better, which is as a result of the program just being better. I think our -- if you look at total spend in the program for this year, it's going to be about 2/3 higher than it was in 2019, right? So, we're growing the program massively. It's been a hugely successful partnership with American Express. We believe that those -- we've said -- we don't give you a lot of details on packet, and we apologize for that. But again, it's pretty sensitive competitively. It's been growing ahead of algorithm. We think it will continue to grow at or ahead of algorithm over time. It's a 10-year deal. I think a lot of people would have predicted the last time we did a credit card deal that credit cards were going to go somehow go away and be replaced by other forms of payments. I think it's quite the contrary. I think travel co-brand cards have become extremely successful and attractive products. They drive engagement across the system. It's not just about the economics on the card. And I think Amex feels the same way. So we're super excited about the deal and probably will stop short on too many more details than what we've already said. I mean we've been assuming that we've been working on this for a while. So I think there's nothing new on that front. Yes, no problem. Yes, there's a lot there. First of all, the whole portfolio is concentrated effectively in U.K., Ireland, Europe and Japan, so particularly Central Europe and Japan have been quite strong. There's no real sort of change in -- I mean, a little bit of year-over-year growth for subsidies last year. That's just a little bit of noise. I think basically, there's operating leverage in the business, right? Their own hotels, their leases, right? So there's even more operating leverage than a regular owned hotel. So they've been growing at a rate that is quite in excess of the overall fee business. As long as fundamentals stay growing, that will continue to be the case. And I think we -- our outlook for the segment is a little bit better now this quarter than it was last quarter because our outlook for Europe and Japan is better. Yes. I wouldn't connect -- is a shorter way of saying, I wouldn't connect too many dots. I mean the world is just different, and the brands, as Chris said, are different. And again, the beauty of Spark is you don't have to get a building built to do a Spark. It's all going to be buildings that are already built."

            "name": "Chris Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us today. We're excited to report strong second quarter results with RevPAR, adjusted EBITDA and EPS exceeding our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter had a record $811 million, the highest single quarter in our company's history. Performance continued to be driven by solid fundamentals, along with continued share gains. Our industry-leading brands, strong commercial engines and powerful partnerships continue to strengthen our system and differentiate us from the competition while a culture of innovation continued to fuel additional growth opportunities. Despite macro challenges over the near term, we're confident in our ability to continue driving solid top line and bottom line growth and, in turn, growing free cash flow. Given the strength of our results thus far and our expectations for the rest of the year, we're increasing our guidance for return of capital for the full year to between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion. Turning to results in the quarter. System-wide RevPAR increased 12.1% year-over-year as strong demand drove continued pricing power across all segments. System-wide occupancy improved four points during the quarter to reach 77% in June, our highest level post pandemic. Business transient RevPAR remained strong, growing 11% year-over-year as trends continue to normalize. Leisure RevPAR increased 7% versus last year, driven by solid rate growth and despite more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Group recovery remained robust in the quarter with RevPAR growing 19% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, system-wide RevPAR grew more than 9% in the quarter with all segments performing well versus prior peaks and accelerating sequentially versus the first quarter. Stable demand and rising rates drove leisure RevPAR growth of 26% versus 2019 and business transient growth of 6% and group RevPAR was roughly flat versus prior peak levels and improved versus the first quarter. As we look to the back half of the year, we expect continued strength driven by recovery in international markets, business transient and group demand. On the group side, we continue to see very positive trends. Our bookings in the quarter for 2024 arrivals grew 30%, with group position now at 13%, up driven by the corporate segment. And our sales team saw the largest revenue bookings in our history for all future arrival periods. Based on all of that, we now expect full year RevPAR growth of between 10% and 12%. Turning to development. We signed more than 36,000 rooms in the second quarter, representing the largest quarterly signs in our history. Conversions accounted for nearly 1/3 of signings in the U.S. Signings in international markets doubled versus last year, accounting for roughly half of system-wide signings in the quarter, driven by strong momentum across Europe and Asia Pacific. In Europe, we signed agreements across 14 countries, including our first Tapestry Hotel in the French Riviera and our first Curio in Croatia. In China, Hilton Garden Inn continued to show tremendous growth since launching our new franchise business model. In the quarter, we signed approximately 3,700 HCI rooms in China more than 3x last year and accounting for more than 1/3 of our signings in China. Signings in America were up 20 in the Americas were up 25 year-over-year with strong interest in the U.S. despite tighter credit conditions. We've signed more than 50 true hotels year-to-date, representing the strongest pace since 2017 as the operating success of existing true properties is linked to a surge in new signings. Results were further helped by Spark with approximately 60 hotels signed and another 400 in negotiation just six months since its launch. Nearly all deals are conversions from third-party brands and half represent new owners to Hilton, with our first park scheduled to open in September and roughly 20 by year-end, Spark is well positioned to disrupt the premium economy segment while expanding our customer and owner base, especially in markets where there is no Hilton brand presence today. In addition to the strong start for Spark, we recently launched an inventive new extended stay brand in the U.S. Under the working title Project H3, the apartment-style accommodations are designed for guests booking 20 or more nights built with the staying power of Hilton's award-winning hospitality. We have received tremendous interest from owners and developers due to the strong market opportunity, cost-efficient build and high-margin model, and we currently have more than 300 deals in negotiation. Our system-wide pipeline now stands at a record 3,000 properties totaling approximately 441,000 rooms, increasing 7% year-over-year and 3% from last quarter. Following another strong quarter of starts, up more than 73% year-over-year roughly and over 40% year-to-date, roughly half of our pipeline is currently under construction. We have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company ensuring guests will have even more options to stay with us in the years to come. Specifically in the U.S., our under construction pipeline has continued to increase, up 15% year-over-year which will contribute to increased openings later this year and next. In fact, in the coming weeks, we're going to open nearly 2,000 additional hotel rooms in New York Times Square with the debut of our first-ever tempo by Hilton than a new tri-brand property featuring Home2 Suites, Hampton Inn and Motto. In the quarter, we celebrated several milestones, including the openings of our 2,900 Hampton Inn and our 600 Home2 Suites property, which remains one of the fastest-growing brands in the industry. Additionally, we surpassed 150,000 rooms in Asia Pacific, including the openings of the Hilton Okinawa, Miyako Island Resort in Japan and the Conrad Shenzhen, our first luxury hotel in China's thriving technology hub. We expect openings to accelerate as the year progresses given strong international and conversion trends and expect conversions to account for around 30% of openings. For the full year, we expect net unit growth of approximately 5%. With forecasts for our highest level of signings, the largest pipeline in our history and approaching the largest under-construction pipeline in our history, we expect net unit growth to accelerate to 5% to 6% next year and to return to 6% to 7% over the next couple of years. As part of our commitment to deliver exceptional experiences for guests, we remain focused on initiatives to drive increased loyalty and satisfaction. We know, for instance, that food and beverage experiences are an integral part of travel and want to ensure our hotels themselves are great dining destinations. We recently formed a first-of-its-kind partnership with the James Beard Foundation serving as the premier sponsor of the 2023 restaurant and Chef awards and continue expanding our partnerships with world-class talents such as Michael Mina, Jose Andres, Nancy Silverton and Paul McGee. Hilton Honors remains the fastest-growing hotel loyalty program with more than 165 million members, up 20% year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all major regions. Honors members accounted for 64% of occupancy in the quarter, up 2 points year-over-year. Hilton team members and our award-winning culture continue to differentiate our brands from the competition, just yesterday, our Waldorf Astoria Home2 and Tru brands were named best in category by J.D. Power for their respective segments in North America. Last week, Hilton was again named as a top employer for millennials for the sixth consecutive year. Since 2016, we've been recognized by Great Place to Work as the world's best hospitality company in over 60 countries. We're thankful for the great work our team members do to serve our guests around the world. We have incredible opportunities ahead to further position ourselves as the leader in hospitality, and we're very excited for the future of travel. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you a few more details on the quarter and expectations for the full year. Yes, great question. And no, I'm not surprised that, that would be the first question. For the record, I think, on the last call, probably three different times I said around 5%. So the truth is, since our last call, I don't think our view has really changed much about where our NUG would be this year. And so it is what it is, it was always a bit back-end loaded. And the simple reason for that, Joe, is in the numbers. If you look at starts, what's been happening with starts, we had a big surge in starts in the second half of last year. Starts were up second half of '22, 40%. And if you look at what they are in the first half of this year, as I stated in my introductory comments, they're up 40%. So that means that a bunch of stuff is just translating into the second half of this year and into next year. And so it really is entirely sort of the timing of -- in the sequencing of how that happens. So, we thought it would be around 5%. We still think it will be around 5%. Our confidence in going back on the way back up, I do feel like -- if we look at the data, it's not just pure optimism, although everybody knows I'm an optimistic sort. I mean if you look at the data, as I already said, starts were way up in the second half of last year. They've been way up in the first half of this year we continue to see good momentum there. Same with signings, I mean, we expect, as I said in my comments, have a record year in signings relative to our prior peak and that -- all of those things are translating into both our optimism about the second half of this year being much stronger than the first half and 2024 being much, much better. It's a bunch of different things that are contributing to that. It's really all regions, even though arguably the U.S. credit conditions are -- make it more challenging. As I already said, we're still up year-to-date over the last -- over the trailing 12 months, 15% in starts. And we have some other nice things that are going to add to our growth here in the United States with Spark. We're only going to open 20 this year. You should assume we're going to open a lot more than that next year and Home3 will start contributing H3 will start contributing next year, probably not a ton, but that is a much more financeable product, even in today's environment because it's probably more apartment than it is a hotel. We are broadly having really good success on conversions and Europe, which had been slow, has really started to pick up. And Asia Pacific really led by China has woken up and the engines have not just restarted, but they're really starting to fire on many more cylinders, I wouldn't say it's all the way there yet, but in the second quarter and our expectation for third and fourth is we're going to start to get a very good momentum. And so that's why we feel pretty darn good on the NUG for next year. Obviously, for giving you a range, I would sort of direct you to the middle of it. If some things go our way and the world stays relatively stable, I think we can be mid-range of that or above, but it's a little bit early in the year to go quite that far. We'll, obviously, next quarter and the following quarter, we'll update you. But I think -- what I would say to people is, again, it's objectively based on things that success we're having in conversions, the success we're having in demand for Spark, conversions all over the world, Spark here. By the way, we will take Spark to Europe relatively quickly. And just what we have in the pipeline, I mean, almost half of our pipelines under construction more than anybody in the industry. And once they start, they almost always finish. So that pickup starting in Q3 last year is starting to pay dividends. And thankfully, the pickup in starts has continued everywhere in the world. And as I said, the world is a big place. So there's a little bit more pressure in the U.S. even though the numbers are still good but a lot less pressure in some other parts of the world that had been feeling it, which is the benefit of a big diversified global business. Yes, happy to. So yes, we moved our numbers up for the second half of the year and thus impacted the full year. That was set on the basis that we're just seeing better results. We -- as we say very regularly, we're not economists, so we try and take the consensus view of what's going on in the macro. The consensus view last quarter was that the second half of the year would see a little bit more meaningful slowdown. I think the consensus for you right now, I mean, you can pick somebody, but it broadly is that it's going to slow down, but it's more of a soft landing and later in the year and more into next year. And so when we factor for that and we look at the momentum, obviously, we've already booked a half a year and we look at what we have reasonable sight lines now into the third quarter, which we feel very good about. And as we look at the fourth quarter, we would probably say the macro views that things will slow. And so we've assumed that, but probably the macro view is that they saw a little bit less than maybe last quarter. And so when you flush all that through, it results in an increase in our guidance. Now there's possible upside if the fourth quarter keeps going like we saw in the second and what it looks like we're going to see in the third, there may be potential. But it certainly warrant increasing our guidance based on where -- what we've already booked for the year, what we see at a macro view in the late part of the year. I mean the interesting thing is like everybody wants to will the business backwards, but we don't really see it. I gave you the stats on leisure, business transient and group. I gave you some sense of where we have really good forward-looking information, which is really on the group segment remaining really, really strong. I mean, obviously, leisure is growing at a somewhat slower pace because of the comps, but I mean it's still way over the prior high watermarks and business transient keeps grinding up and getting better and the same with group. So, as I'm sitting here today, honestly, while we will take a macro view of later in the year because we're not economists, we're not seeing any signs of weakness. I know there's a lot of questions on the leisure business. I mean what I would say to you is like we're not seeing -- we're having it a wildly strong summer in leisure. I mean the only places where leisure has backed off a bit is where you would expect it, where it's normalizing from like crazy highs. It's still in those markets, which I'll talk about way over '19 levels. But I mean it's just sort of coming back, not even to earth, but sort of in our universe, I guess. And those are markets like South Florida, Hawaii, parts of Southern California where it was just like it was insane. But broadly, we have a very diversified leisure business. Broadly, we're not really -- again, other than comps being harder, we continue to see good growth, and we expect to -- and at least what sight lines we have in the business transient, talking to a bunch of customers, which I've done very recently. And certainly, our sales team talks to them all the time, and we got everybody together as we always do last week to talk about it. They're feeling quite good, particularly the SMBs, which is at this point, 85% plus of our business. They're traveling more. They're feeling reasonably good about soft landing in their business. And then group and there's pent-up demand there and group, there's still huge amounts of pent-up demand that haven't been released, as I said, we're -- we had the best booking quarter in our history ever in the second quarter and our position is great for next year. And you're still not where you're going to be with all the big associations because that was really driven by corporate group. So a bunch of the big association groups, I mean, they are booking, but that's multiyear booking cycles, that's still to come. And so we don't see weakness. Obviously, we're sentient and we know what the Fed is trying to do. We'll hear this afternoon, what the next steps are? I expect they are going to raise rates. But I do think we're probably getting to the end-ish of that tightening cycle. Inflation is coming down, some of the lag caters that will eventually come into the inflation numbers. Housing in particular, is definitely real time coming down and will eventually show up. And so, I do think -- we'll see. Again, I'm not an economist, but I do think consensus view is starting to center around a softer landing, maybe late this year or sometime next year. And that feels rational based on everything going on. And as I said, our business, we're not seeing any real cracks anywhere. And of course, the places in the world that had been lagging are now starting to like produce. So, the most significant lag everywhere was doing really well, but China -- and now China is eclipsing prior high watermarks and getting going on development, as I already said, but also operationally, eclipsing 2019 numbers. So not to be a [indiscernible], it all feels pretty good and if we can orchestrate a slowdown but a reasonably soft landing, I think the rest of this year is going to be very solid and in line or better than what we said. And I think next year will be a darn good year because I still think there'll be strength in leisure. But particularly, there'll be if you get a reasonably decent slowdown soft landing, you're going to have continued growth in business transient, particularly with SMBs, which is the vast majority of the business. And group is going to be pretty sticky because people just have to do some of the stuff and particularly in a soft landing environment, I don't think you're going to see a big change there, anytime soon. So, it's early. I'm not going to -- like, obviously, I'm not going to give guidance yet for next year. We're not it's sort of crazy to do that. We got a lot of year to see how things play out. But I sit here today, I feel quite good about the rest of this year. I actually feel quite good about as we later this summer, get into budget season, how we feel about next year. And that's reflected, as you not surprisingly. And the guidance we're giving the increase in our return of capital, I mean I think that should be read for what it is. I think that the algorithm stands. I mean -- and in fact, even -- by the way, while NUG has been a little bit lower, RevPAR has been higher. I mean it's a pretty perfect hedge, meaning -- we've been running a little lower on one a little higher on the other. My guess is it's going to flip around over the next couple of years. And as I said, we're going to get back to 6% to 7% and same-store growth is going to normalize. But we think the algorithm is alive and well and will deliver at those -- in those ranges that we've talked about as a result of increased growth rates from where we are, increased license fee rates, overall RevPAR growth, the deals that we've done on the licensing side, which generally drag us up because they're at or above algorithm growth rates. We feel very good about that algorithm that we laid out in 2016 that it's alive and well in producing. And as a result, we're producing today more free cash flow than we ever had in history, which is what allows us to return so much capital. Again, that will keep -- both of those things will keep going up as well. Sure, David. Thanks. Really good question. So yes, I got here with Kevin and others about 16 years ago, and this company had brands that were pretty good, but not performing that well today, we have 22 brands. So we have, I think, really built a very powerful sort of engine of innovation to figure out what customers want, what segments we're missing and to give them more of what they want and do it with very high-quality brands and then deliver commercial performance that's winning performance and market-leading performance is that we attract lots of capital. I don't think we have a brand and we have some that are early, but I don't think we have a brand. I know we don't that isn't performing at -- either equal to or above everybody in the space. And so listen, I say that sort of patting us on the back because I'm very proud of that. Every company has different strategies. We think this strategy is a winning strategy because it delivers better products for our customers over time that meet the market in a modern context, and it's better from a return point of view because we're doing it with blood, sweat and tears and not investing capital. And so it's an infinite return and better for the customers is sort of how do you not like it. Many of those brands, not all, and I'll talk about that, have been in the mid-market. Why? Because that's the biggest opportunity. And so we're trying to serve any customer for any need to have anywhere they want in the world. But obviously, we have focused a lot on where the big markets are, where the big addressable TAMs are total addressable markets. And there's no way you could debate that every segment is important, but the mid-market is where the people are. I mean the big demographic trend in the world. I don't have to tell anybody on this call is growing middle classes all over the world, right? And that's where the money is and those people can afford mid-market hotels. And so when you wake up in 10 or 20 years, the bulk of the rooms growth in the world, that's the bulk of the money that's going to be made is in the mid-market. So that's why we have focused there. But we have not focused exclusively there. We've done a bunch of things in the lifestyle space, with Urban Micro like Motto, with Tempo with Canopy at the upper upscale lifestyle segment. And obviously, in the luxury space, we have made huge strides. I mean, Waldorf existed but wasn't really a brand and Conrad was not much to speak about. And LXR didn't exist. And so, we've gone from essentially a few hotels to 100 world-class luxury hotels with another nearly 60 in the pipeline. And by the way, I said it, but this morning, if you look at Bloomberg or whatever, Waldorf Astoria was ranked the number one luxury brand Eclipse Ritz-Carlton and customer satisfaction in North America. So, we're making really good strides there. And I think there are more opportunities. I would say, listen, we've talked about this for a long time. And the only reason we haven't done it is because we've had other market opportunities that we thought would drive, would serve more customers, drive higher growth and create more value for shareholders, but luxury lifestyle is definitely -- I mean, we're in and around the lifestyle segment, LXR, to a degree is sort of luxury lifestyle. But we don't have a pure hard brand in the luxury lifestyle. Yes, we will. I would say we're doing developmental work there. We want to give our babies spark and H3. While H3, we need to give a name, which we're close to. And then we need to make sure they become little toddlers and are successful but we're doing developmental work in luxury lifestyle. I would expect in the next year, we'll launch something in that space to sort of add to the three brands we have already in the luxury space to give us another shot on goal for luxury opportunities around the world. But the -- and so luxury and lifestyle are hugely important to us because customers like it, and we give them lots and lots of opportunities, but again, the big mass market opportunity every -- in every major market in the world, is the mid-market. And so, we are not ashamed of saying we are -- we have every intention to have the best brands in every market to serve mid-market because we think that's where the most money will be made over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years. I'm not really. I mean not really. As I said in the last call, I said around 5%. And if you go listen to it, maybe three times I mean a little bit, although it's not meaning -- I mean, listen, we were hoping from the standpoint of the momentum that we have in Spark. We were hoping to have 50 hotels open this year, I think by the last quarter, we realized that, that wasn't going to happen. But we're going to have, as I said, we're going to probably have 20. There's no problem. I mean we have 400 deals in negotiation with hundreds more coming over the threshold. It's just -- and the supply chain stuff is now set up and moving. It was a lot of moving parts as we get set up. And so -- that probably has a teeny bit of impact. I mean 20 to 50 is a few thousand rooms, but otherwise, not really -- No. I mean, again, I said around 5%. I'm still -- we still think it's around 5. Yes. For us, it's been better than the industry. We're 3 or 4 percentage points off of depending on when you look at it off of peak occupancies. I think that you sort of noted some of the issues. I think part of it is happening because of the group. It's still -- our group is getting there, but it's still building. Part of it is -- and that's impacting a bunch of the cities, right, that have recovered a lot most of them. There are a couple of exceptions or one big exception, but most of the cities have recovered. But from an occupancy point of view, they're still off because they don't have the big citywide spec. So I do think it is partly the group. And then the other thing that's going on is, I sort of kid not to be a smartass about it, but part of it is in, right? So if you said to me, could we drive occupancy consistent with the prior peak. The answer is, yes, I could probably do it in the next couple of days, but it wouldn't be the right answer. Meaning, we are pushing hard on price because we've been obviously in a highly inflationary environment. And from the standpoint of trying to make our hotel owners the most money, that relative trade is the right trade, keep pushing price hard even though it might impact occupancy. The bottom line is better because the flow-through on rates a heck of a lot better than the flow-through on occupancy. So part of this is, yes, there's still goods coming back. You have business transient is still particularly the big corporates are only 92% back, part of -- and they'll come back no matter what they say, by the way, over the next few years, they'll come back. You heard it here. I'm telling you they'll come back. But a bigger part of it is, honestly, yield management strategies. I mean, we're really trying to push rate, and we don't want to give -- we're not as worried because it's a better outcome for every a better outcome for us, our owners make more money to drive higher margins. The answer is yes. I mean there is a tiny disconnect in timing. But I'd say the core pricing of our transient products, whether that's leisure or leisure transient or business transient is keeping up with inflation at its current levels. And obviously, we expect that to continue to come down. We feel good about the pricing power, again, with all the assumptions I already commented on about my view or the macro view that we've adopted for the back half of the year. And as we go into next year, and we think the broader environment is generally supportive for continued rate strength. I mean the one thing -- it's funny we talked -- I kid our team around here, it's like we've been living a little bit in bizarro world coming through COVID, obviously, and then in the aftermath, where you all be about fundamentals. That's all we would ever talk about on these calls. It all has ever talked about with investors, the fundamentals of demand, what's going on with demand and what's going on with supply. In the bizarro world, nobody talks -- nobody cares about supply. But we're now in a lie. I mean, everything is just getting reasonably close to a more normalized environment. prices are higher, okay, but that's just a broader reset that's happened throughout the entire economy, which I think unless you have broad disinflation, which it doesn't feel like that's happening anytime soon, that's sustained. And so you've sort of set a new water level, if you will, for pricing. And then eventually, in the very near term, it's going to get back to basic fundamentals, like what's going on with base demand and what's going on in supply. And I think the thing that doesn't get enough attention, like thankfully, as you can see in our starts and signings and NUG and our expectations for the future, we get a heck of a lot more than our fair share. But what's really going on in supply, particularly in the U.S. is anemic levels of industry growth that are sub if the 30-year average is 2.5%, it's running like 0.8% and it will be, and it's been running low. And given the environment, it's going to stay low. And so when you get to a more normalized environment, which is we're sort of morphing slowly into over the next year or two, you're going to find yourself in an environment where demand should be reasonably healthy if the economy is okay against a historically low supply side environment in the industry. And so, I think it's going to feel pretty good. And I think it's going to be another factor for sustaining performance and rate integrity. Yes. The other minor segment, I think that's well said, is on H3. I mentioned in my comments, it's a hybrid, and it's probably more apartment than hotel. We've been really excited about the institutional interest that we have from larger institutions that either want to develop or work with a partner and fund the development of large numbers of H3 just because of the cost to build the -- it's we think a 60% kind of margin business, and they really like the segment of demand and its existing profile and growth profile. So that's been not surprising because we -- when we were developing H3, that was our hope and expectation, but it's nice to see it come to life. I mean, as I said, we're negotiating 300 deals and that's not with 300 different people at this point. We barely opened it up. This is with a relatively limited number of very well-heeled more institutional type players. We will ultimately open the floodgates on H3 once we get it going. But it's been very nice to see. Yes. Just for the record, in the signings numbers, then starts signings will be above prior high watermarks pretty materially, and starts will be about -- even though the comps are resi be about where we were at our prior high watermark. So, it's not just the benefit of comps. I'll let Kevin take the next part of it. But I mean, Spark, the beauty of Spark is it's a relatively low-cost entry product. And so, it doesn't really require a lot of financing. Yes. Good question. I think the answer is yes on not just Spark and H3 in the U.S., but Home2 in the U.S., Hampton is growing in the U.S. I'll come back Tempo is just getting started. So I think the combination of all of those brands, the benefit of conversions in soft brands will get us back, I am confident to those levels. The difference between like a Tempo and Motto and Spark is night and day, honestly. I mean here's what happened at Tempo and Motto. We launched them about a day before the pandemic and they are all new build. I mean it's pretty much with both those brands. There are some adaptive reuse that will go on, but it is a vast majority of those -- our new builds. And so we got into COVID, there was no financing if everything slowed down. Those brands, I think, will do incredibly well. I think Tempo, we have I don't even have the pipeline number in my head. But as we open Times Square, we've got dozens of those under development around the country. We're getting ready to take the show on the road around the world and now that we're in -- even though the environment has some uncertainty in financing and all that, it's a heck of a lot better than it was in COVID. So, you'll start to see a great trajectory and Tempo, there's nothing wrong. Tempos are great, owners love it. It's just COVID got in the away. Basically saying same for Motto, Spark is a totally different thing. One, it's not -- we're not COVID. While there are challenges out there, it's 100%, 100% conversion brand. And it's basically taking hotels that are in much weaker brands and converting them into our system where there's huge opportunities for market share gains and it doesn't cost in terms of the quantum of money to do it, it's a relatively low ticket for owners to do it, thus, why we have so much interest. So I think the ramp on that will be much, much faster, and it's a very different thing. But I wouldn't diminish the opportunities in Motto and Tempo. They're going to -- particularly Tempo, Mottos, a micro hotel in just the biggest urban markets, we'll do a lot more of them. But I mean, Tempo will be a mega brand. It just got caught up in getting launched a minute before COVID. Thank you, MJ. Everybody, we appreciate as we always do, you spending a little bit of your morning with us. We know it's a busy time and lots of earnings releases. We obviously remain really optimistic. Obviously, Q2 was a great quarter for us. That's flowing through plus some given our expectations for the second half of the year. Again, we're optimistic on our unit growth and optimistic for not just the end of this year, but in the next year, we'll be able to deliver. But most importantly, the algorithm that we've described is alive and well and working and we continue to grow. We continue to maintain incredible cost discipline. The Company is at the highest margins by 800 basis points ever run at, thus producing the greatest amount of free cash flow in our history, and we intend to be super disciplined about how we allocate that otherwise known as giving it back to our shareholders. And so in any event, we'll look forward after Q3, giving you an update on how everything is going. I hope everybody has a great rest of the summer."

Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.  With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Nassetta: Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report that demand for travel remains strong, maintaining the trend that we saw in the back half of last year, which led to both our top and bottom line results finishing the quarter above the high end of our guidance. As we move forward, fundamentals remain strong, and we expect secular tailwinds to continue to support growth. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we're optimistic that the power of our network effect, our industry-leading RevPAR premiums and our fee-based capital-light business model will continue to drive strong operating performance, unit growth and meaningful cash flow, enabling us to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 30% year-over-year and 8% compared to 2019. Rate continued to drive growth, up 11% compared to 2019, and system-wide occupancy reached 68%, up from the prior quarter and just 2 points shy of peak levels. Globally, all segments outperformed expectations, and the lifting of COVID restrictions in China drove significant recovery in demand across Asia Pacific throughout the quarter. As a result, RevPAR in the month of March exceeded 2019 levels across all regions and segments for the first time since the pandemic began. Given our strong results and positive momentum, we're raising both top and bottom line guidance for the full year, which Kevin will cover in more detail in just a few minutes. Turning to the segment details. Leisure trends remained strong throughout the quarter with RevPAR surpassing 2019 by approximately 15%, ahead of prior quarter performance. Strong leisure transient demand continue to drive rates up in the mid-teens above 2019 and occupancy fully recovered back to 2019 levels, driven by the surge in travel in Asia Pacific. Business transient also continued to improve with RevPAR up 4% from 2019, reflecting the resiliency of business travel, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, which remained roughly 85% of our segment mix. Recovery in group remains robust with RevPAR finishing roughly in line with 2019 with steady improvement each month in the quarter and March exceeding 2019 by 5%. Demand for future bookings also remained strong with full year group position up 28% year-over-year and 3% versus 2019. Additionally, new group leads ended in the quarter 13% higher than 2019, an increase of 6 points compared to prior quarter. Looking at the full year, based on the better-than-expected Q1 results, the accelerated demand across Asia and continued positive momentum in group, we now expect full year system-wide top line growth between 8% and 11% versus 2022, assuming some slowdown in the back half of the year due to macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in the U.S. Turning to development. In the first quarter, we opened 64 properties totaling over 9,000 rooms, celebrating several milestones, including the opening of our 500th hotel in China, our 100th addition to the Tapestry Collection and the opening of the Canopy Toronto Yorkville, the Lifestyle brand's debut in Canada. We also opened 2 new Embassy Suite resort properties in Virginia Beach and Aruba with the Aruba addition marking the brand's 10th international property. And after recently being ranked the #1 Hotel Franchise in Entrepreneur Magazine's Franchise 500 for a record-breaking 14th year in a row, Hampton by Hilton expanded its global presence to 37 countries with the brand's first property in Ecuador. While we expect to see some impact from the current financing environment, we are encouraged by the progress on the signings and starts front. We signed approximately 25,000 rooms during the quarter, growing our pipeline to a record 428,000 rooms, more than half of which are currently under construction. Signings in the quarter outpaced prior year across all regions. And conversion signings in the quarter were 24% higher than prior year, benefiting in part from the rollout of our newly-launched brand, Spark by Hilton. The initial interest in Spark has been tremendous. We currently have more than 300 deals in various stages of negotiation, and our teams are working hard to deliver this exciting new premium economy conversion brand with hotels opening later this year. Hilton Garden Inn also continues to be an engine of global growth with 14 new signings across 6 countries in the quarter and over 60 working deals in 22 countries. Additionally, in April, we announced the signing of the Waldorf Astoria Jaipur, marking the debut of the brand in India and further demonstrating our commitment to expanding our world-class luxury brands across the globe. Construction starts for the quarter totaled over 19,000 rooms, up nearly 20% from prior year, and starts in the U.S. were up more than 50% year-over-year. Our global under construction pipeline is up 8% compared to March 2022. And per STR, we continue to lead the industry in total rooms under construction. Taking all this into account, we still expect to deliver net unit growth within our guidance range this year and remain confident in our ability to return to 6% to 7% net unit growth over the next couple of years. On the loyalty front, Hilton Honors grew to more than 158 million members, a 19% increase year-over-year and remains the fastest-growing hotel loyalty program. In the quarter, Hilton Honors members accounted for 62% of occupancy, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. Additionally, in an effort to further provide our loyal guests with an elevated wellness experience, in April, we announced the international expansion of our partnership with Peloton, bringing Peloton bikes to properties across the UK, Germany, Canada and Puerto Rico, building on our existing partnership to make Peloton bikes available in all U.S. hotels. As one of the world's largest hospitality companies, we recognize Hilton has the responsibility to protect the planet and to support the communities we serve to ensure our hotel destinations remain vibrant and resilient for generations of travelers to come. In early April, we published our 2022 Travel with Purpose Report, outlining our latest progress towards our 2030 environmental, social and governance goals, including our efforts to reduce our environmental impact while creating engines of opportunity within our communities and preserving the beautiful destinations where we live, work and travel. We remain committed to driving responsible travel and tourism globally while furthering positive environmental and social impact and sound governance across our operations and our communities. All of our success would not be possible without the dedicated efforts of our talented team, and we continue to be recognized for our remarkable workplace culture. Recently, Great Place to Work and Fortune ranked Hilton the #2 workplace in the U.S., our eighth consecutive year on the list, and once again, the top-ranked hospitality company, an accomplishment I'm truly proud of. Overall, despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that our world-class brands, dedicated team members and resilient business model have us incredibly well positioned for the future.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the quarter and our expectations for the full year.\nKevin Jacobs : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 30% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis and increased 8% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by strong demand in APAC as well as continued strength in leisure and steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $641 million in the first quarter, up 43% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth across all regions as well as strong performance in Europe and Japan benefiting our ownership portfolio. Management and franchise fees grew 30% year-over-year, driven by continued RevPAR improvement. Continued good cost discipline further benefited results. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.24, increasing 75% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 21% year-over-year with performance continuing to be led by strong leisure demand. Both business transient and group RevPAR finished above 2019 peak levels for the second consecutive quarter, driven by strong rate growth. In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR increased 56% year-over-year and 35% versus 2019. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand at resort properties where RevPAR was up over 60% compared to peak levels. In Europe, RevPAR grew 68% year-over-year and was 13% higher than 2019. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, particularly from the U.S. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 32% year-over-year and 42% versus 2019, led by strong rate growth and group demand. In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR was up 91% year-over-year and down only 4% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 5% compared to 2019, 32 points better than prior quarter as demand recovery accelerated due to the lifting of COVID restrictions. The rest of the Asia Pacific region also saw a significant improvement with RevPAR, excluding China, up 19% versus 2019, representing an 11-point improvement versus prior quarter. Turning to development. Our pipeline grew year-over-year and sequentially and now totals 428,000 rooms with nearly 60% located outside the U.S. and over half under construction. Looking at the full year, despite the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, we still expect net unit growth between 5% and 5.5%. Moving to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 10% and 12% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $770 million and $790 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.54 and $1.59. For full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth of between 8% and 11%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.875 billion and $2.95 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $5.68 and $5.88. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of 15% -- $0.15 per share during the first quarter for a total of $41 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $600 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, and we expect to return between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the full year. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.  This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question, please. Chad, can we have our first question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli : Chris, just in terms of the way you guys are thinking about the year, your guidance, obviously, from a RevPAR perspective, up about 350 basis points at the midpoint. First quarter obviously contributes some of that lift. You guys spoke to a tougher macroeconomic situation in the second half of the year on your fourth quarter call. How much has your outlook on the second half changed as obviously, you get some contribution from the first quarter, you have a lot of visibility in the second quarter? Just trying to understand within the context of that guidance, if you've had any kind of change or pushing out of when you guys believe or when you're interpreting the macroeconomic conditions will toughen.\nChristopher Nassetta : Yes, a really good question. Obviously, I think I used the macroeconomic uncertainty two or three times for a reason because there is an uncertain environment. I mean, what we're seeing today is, as you heard in what you saw in our numbers and in the prepared comments is very good strength across all our segments. Leisure continues to be super strong. Business transient in the quarter, both demand and pricing, has returned to prior peak levels and group is motoring on its way. It's just longer in gestation to get there. But based on the trends, it's going to get there in the second half of the year, I think, with a great deal of certainty. So we are not -- you didn't really ask it this way, but I think part of it is we're not seeing any cracks in terms of demand patterns. There is a lot of momentum. I sit at this very table every Monday morning with my entire executive committee, representing every region of the world. And the first question I ask, are you seeing any cracks? Any issues with demand broadly? Any issues regionally? Any issues from a segment point of view? And the truth is we're just not seeing it. Having said that, we know here in the U.S. and in many other places around the world, there's an inflation issue. Now it's being -- it is being managed. It's becoming -- it is in the process of normalizing, particularly here in the U.S., but it's not there. And the Fed has said it's going to deal with it. I believe that -- I take them at their word. And I think ultimately, that means you're going to continue to have a slowing of the broader economic environment that, at some point, has to have some impact on us. It hasn't yet for a bunch of reasons, I suggested: one, I still think we have a lot of pent-up demand; two, we are still benefiting from a secular shift in spending patterns broadly. So while people may have a little less to spend, they're spending more of it on experiences and a lot less of it on things. You see that throughout the economy. And international travel is finally, with China opening up, while it's not back anywhere near where it has been, international travel is really on a steep up-slope. And all of those things are keeping the momentum in demand in the business. Recognizing also, by the way, that capacity additions are at historical lows and are probably going to stay there for a while. So when I said very quickly in my comments, fundamentals remain strong, I mean, fundamentals are supply and demand. Demand is good for the reasons I suggest that supply in the industry is anemic. Thankfully, we get a lot more than our fair share of the supply, so that's good for us. But the basic fundamentals in the business are good. Having said all of that, we do expect things will slow down. You asked a question which I'm actually going to answer, which is, do I feel any differently than I did sitting here a quarter ago. And I would say, yes, I would say number one, the economy appears to be more resilient. Inflation is being tamed. I have a higher degree of confidence at this point. I'm not the right person to ask, but well, I'll tell you what I think. I have a higher degree of confidence that the Fed will land the plane reasonably well and that we're not going to have a deep dark kind of recession. We're going to have a slowdown, maybe a recession. It feels a lot more like it will be reasonably modest at this point. So I feel better about that. And I definitely feel like things have been pushed out a little bit. One, just time has gone by. We have now a quarter under our belt. We're deep into understanding half of the year. I mean, we're not done. There's a bunch of the second quarter left, but we have pretty good sight lines at this point into Q2. And that feels like the momentum is continuing. So you get a half a year sort of under your belt. It gives you more confidence. And so I feel better about, thus why we increased our guidance on the top line and bottom line because I feel like there's enough momentum in our business. The economy broadly is pretty resilient. There's more confidence in the Fed being able to sort of do this without wreaking too much havoc. So I'd say net-net, yes, I feel a bit better. Having said that, we did and I said it intentionally in the prepared comments, we do assume because we are sentient and we know what's going on, that at some point, you will see some slowing. I think realistically, it's more late third quarter and into the fourth quarter. I honestly think there's a chance it kicks into next year, given the broader momentum and the strength of the consumer broadly. But I don't know. And so what we've tried to do in our guidance is, build in an expectation that this -- these efforts of the Fed here and in other parts of the world will eventually work and that we're going to see some, at least, modest slowdown. And so that's sort of what -- we feel better than we did. We still think there's a lot of uncertainty, and we've tried to factor for that in our guidance in the second half of the year.\nCarlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, Chris. And then if I could, just one quick follow-up. In the period, obviously, I think managed franchise RevPAR was 29%. Unit growth on the franchise side was 4.4. The fees -- franchise fees grew about 23%. I'm assuming that, that's a comp issue with some ancillary non-RevPAR fees in the 1Q of '22?\nChristopher Nassetta : Correct. Yes. I mean, the way to think about those is those are normalizing in growth rates, above algorithm growth, above typical growth you would assume sort of on a same-store basis. But we're still particularly because of Omicron, on the fee side, we have a supercharged fee growth rate in the first quarter. But I think the way to think about, over the intermediate, even longer term, is we think all of those ancillary license fees and otherwise, they're going to grow better than our typical algorithm growth. You're just -- yes, you have some year-over-year normalization going on in Omicron impact.\nKevin Jacobs : And a little bit of mix as well, so the franchise business is a little more concentrated in the U.S. where RevPAR growth has not been as robust as outside the U.S.\nOperator: And the next question is from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.\nJoseph Greff : Chris, I'd love to hear your views on and your understanding of what developers are feeling right now, just given changes in the credit markets and the banking environment, particularly with maybe limited service developers that are more reliant on regional bank for financing. Are they requesting more capital help from you guys? Do you think maybe they're pulling forward some deals maybe in an effort to circumvent future tightening? Can you talk about what your expectation is for maybe pipeline growth for the balance of the year? And then I have a follow-up.\nChristopher Nassetta : Yes. I mean, it's early. So we've obviously been talking to a lot of our ownership community as the banking issues have sort of taken hold. And I would say there's a broad range that anecdotally go from, we haven't seen much impact. We're still getting finance. As you can see in our numbers in starts in the U.S. being so far up. Now part of that was before the banking, the regional local banking set of issues, but part of it was after. They're still getting the best owners with the best relationships are getting their deals done, and our market share in a tougher environment goes up. So proportionately relative to others in the industry, we typically do even better. But we also have folks that are saying very hard to find the money and some in the middle that are saying like they're talking to their banks and their banks are saying, \"Hey, we're going to be there for you. Just give me like 90 days. Let me see how this all plays out.\" And so I think it's early to know. I think being objective about it, which I always am trying to be, I think the Fed seems to be managing through this reasonably well. There's some ongoing things today or this week going on, but I think the Fed, I think, is pretty committed to making sure there isn't sort of a run on regional banks broadly. So I think we're in reasonably good shape that way. But I think that the net result is for a period of time, there'll be less credit available, okay? I still think we'll get more than our fair share of it because our brands are better performing, and we'll see our share go up as we historically do when times get tougher for financing, et cetera. But it's hard to believe that in the short to intermediate term, there's not going to be some impact. It hasn't shown up. It didn't show up in the first quarter. We haven't seen it yet, but I think in terms of pipeline, people, I think our expectation at this point for the year is the pipeline is going to keep growing. The bigger question is going to be the conversion under construction. In the first quarter, it was very, very good, as you heard, in the data. I think that will get more challenging. I think it just stands to reason that will get more challenging. And so listen, the good news for us is we tend to get -- our share goes up. It's a big world. While China has been a little bit slower to sort of pick up steam on the development side, it is picking up steam, I think, particularly as we think about next year, I think it's going to be a big net contributor. And conversions are -- have been and continue to be a big focus of ours. We think we'll do meaningfully more as a percentage of overall delivery this year as conversion somewhat aided by this year a little bit, but a lot, I think, next year by Spark, which is 100% conversion, very low cost of entry in a relative very, very lightly, if dependent at all, on the banking community. So that's not why we did Spark. We did Spark for all the right reasons, to better serve, create a bigger and better network effect, but just in time management, the timing of it actually is quite good. As we said, it's not going to do a lot for this year, but I think over -- starting next year and beyond, it will add significantly. But the net of all that, Joe, is, again, answering -- I'm trying to give a little bit of color across the board. We do expect that what's going on in the banking system, particularly for limited service, which is disproportionately financed by the regional and local banks, that they're going to pull in their horns. They're going to survive. Most of them are going to get through this, but there's going to be less credit available, and that's going to slow things down a bit.\nJoseph Greff : Great. Thank you for that, Chris. And just my follow-up question is this, the system-wide RevPAR is flat, which is sort of what's baked into the second half guidance. But if we just think about it for the intermediate term, not that you're guiding to anything beyond the second half, do you think fee growth can be in excess of RevPAR growth, just given the rooms growth in the last few years?\nChristopher Nassetta : Should be, yes. It should be mathematically, yes. The algorithm is, as you know, so the same-store plus unit growth. And we've been delivering on average even through COVID, 5-ish, maybe a tick over, even in an environment that is being impacted by some of the things I just described. We believe we'll continue to do that as we manage our way over the next couple of years back up to the 6% to 7%. And so even in a no growth same-store environment, which is not certainly what we're experiencing now for the record, as you can see, but even in that environment, fees would continue to grow with unit growth.\nOperator: And the next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley : Chris, I kind of wanted to stick with the development activity, but maybe let's just go out a little bit longer term. And if you could help us pull from a little bit of your experience of how this played out during the global financial crisis a little bit. Just help us think about, if we think about some of the -- there's kind of three drivers, I think, about domestic unit growth, obviously, decently reliant on the financial system; the conversion activity, where you've got a pretty interesting pipeline of brands that might even be stronger than back then; and then the international side. Can you help us think about sort of buckets 2 and 3? And as we get on to '24 and '25, how much could those help carry the weight? And how protected do you think, let's call it, a broad mid-single-digit net unit growth target should be in a variety of different scenarios as people are just trying to think about broader fallout here from financing and again, a more difficult macro broadly?\nChristopher Nassetta : Yes. I mean, that's the right question to ask. And that's why I said, yes, we do expect to see some impact. But I also said, maybe I backed into it but I'll say it more directly, we feel good about being in that range you described. We've been around 5 through the toughest down cycle in recorded history. Through COVID, we've stayed sort of 5-ish or a tick above. And we think over the next period of time, as these things sort of work their way through the system, that we'll be able to say there. How are we going to do it? Well, one, we're going to gain share because our products perform better, and we have the highest market share brands in the business. We're going to keep pushing market share higher. And so while there's going to be potentially less new build activity domestically, we will plan to work hard to get an even larger share of that. Conversions, we do believe that we're uniquely suited certainly relative to The Great Recession by having not only more shots on goal in terms of brands. But Spark, again, there's -- long term, we think Spark is probably the most disruptive thing that we'll have ever done in terms of giving customers, at that price point, a really good product. But it's also, the timing of it is convenient and helpful because it depends very little on financing. Most of the other conversions still depend on financing. A lot of conversions, not all, but a lot of conversions do happen around asset transactions where people say I'm a buyer and a seller and I'm going to change brands and upgrade properties. We'll still convert a bunch of other types of properties that -- where they're not changing ownership, but no change -- lower change of ownership puts a little pressure on that. But Spark is I guess that we'll keep giving in the sense of unit growth because, again, you're talking about 20,000 rooms. You're talking about a $2 million sort of bogey for somebody to convert and get into our system versus even at the lowest price point, newbuilds that require financing and/or writing checks of $10 million, $15 million or, in most cases, much higher than that. So conversions will play a big part in it. And as I already said, it's a big world. So what's going on here in the U.S. is with the banking system is unlike The Great Recession where the whole financial system around the world was sort of imperiled in free fall, this really at the moment is more of a U.S. thing, obviously touched Europe a little bit and Switzerland, but it has largely been sort of continued to be a U.S. thing. And so you have the opportunities around the whole rest of the world. Notably, as I said, China, in the sense that China is probably taking a quarter or two more. So I think China won't contribute what I would have hoped it would this year, but I think it will be made up for next in '24 and '25 because the engines are really cranking up. It's just a process. So it will be conversions, international growth and increased market share of what does get done in the U.S. The other thing that is going on is we launched Spark. We're getting ready, and I'll maybe tickle the ivories a little bit. We're getting ready to launch another brand sort of at the -- in the extended-stay space at the lower end, mid-scale, very low end of mid-scale, below home to that we have -- we've been working with our ownership community and customers on that while it will be a newbuild product, it will be a very efficient build cost. So again, the things -- my history of this living through The Great Recession, all that is your lower cost to build products that have -- that are very high margin because people make the most money doing it and they're the lowest risk and they're the easiest financed. Those are the ones that get going the fastest. And so again, we didn't develop this brand that we're getting ready to launch, hopefully, in the next 30 or 60 days because of this. We launched because customers want it, owners want to build it. But again, it won't have any effect this year but starting probably the latter part of '24, more likely '25 as people look at a brand that can deliver just astronomical margins on a very efficient per unit build cost, we think it will build a lot of excitement. Home2 has been off the hooks in demand throughout all of COVID and otherwise because people make -- such customers love it, it's very high margin. We think customers are going to love this. It's something different. It's at a lower price point. But the margins are much even higher than that. And so again, it will take time to gestate that, but we think that is a mega brand opportunity for us that as we think about more likely '25, '26, even in an environment that's been more challenging -- is more challenging from a financing point of view, as the financing markets come back and they always do, it's those products that really get done fastest. And so we feel good about being around 5 and headed back to 6 to 7 over the next couple of years, and it will be a combo platter of all of those things that you said and that I just spoke to.\nOperator: And the next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi.\nSmedes Rose : I just wanted to ask you quickly on that extended-stay launch. We've seen a lot of products from different brands being launched to the extended-stay segment. And I was just curious, what do you think is driving so much interest from customers? And are they abandoning another segment of mid-scale? We don't get data or at least in our case, we don't get extended-stay data specifically. We just see the chain scale data. I'm just wondering what sort of shifts you're seeing within that, that it's leading so many people to launch into that sector.\nChristopher Nassetta : We were already seeing it pre-COVID, where there was just a demand for workforce housing and people -- more mobility in their lives and they wanted to be places and work from different places. And they didn't -- they were going to be there long enough to commit. They're like, get an apartment and pay a one year's deposit and all that fun stuff. And so we are already seeing demand that was outstripping supply. And then COVID hit. And while a lot of things have normalized, and I've talked about this on prior calls a bunch of times, the one thing that happened is it accelerated the idea of mobility. While the office environment is normalizing, a lot of people are going back. It's not exactly what it was. More people are going to be remote as a percentage of the workforce permanently. More are going to have flexibility and sort of different times of year, times of the week, Mondays and Fridays. And all of that is continuing to just -- as those patterns shift, it's building more and more demand against a limited amount of supply. And so the fundamentals we think are just great. The way I think about the product that we're developing, and I'm getting ahead of myself, but it's coming really soon. I mean, down we have -- we've built it. We've done 99% of the work. It's almost a hybrid. It's like an apartment efficiency meets hotel. And I'd say it's almost like 60-40. It's more apartment efficiency. There's so many workforce housing needs that are just unmet with this kind of product for somebody who needs to be somewhere 30, 60, 90, 120 days. So you're talking about average length of stay of probably 20 to 30 days on average versus most of the core extended-stay brands are like 5 to 10 maybe, somewhere in that range, if you look at the industry. So it's a different demand base, different types of locations, which is why we love it because we're not serving it, meaning it's not competitive with what we're doing with Home2 and certainly not competitive with Homewood because it's serving a totally different need, mostly in totally different markets. And as I said, we -- I didn't intend to go this far, sorry. But this is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hotels over time. This is not like we're going to do 50 or 100 of these. I mean, you'll wake up over time in 10 years, and will -- it will be like Home2. We'll have 4, 5, 6. We'll have a lot of these because we think the need is there now and growing. And we -- while a lot of people are doing things in this arena, I think we've proven by launching brands that we do uniquely have done it pretty well to launch brands and get to scale and build network effect, not just broadly for the company but within brands. And we've done that, I think, as well or better than anybody. And I think we have an opportunity to do it here. And our system delivers. The system delivers the highest market share in the business. So if you're an owner thinking about I'm going to build a similar product somewhere else, I mean, you're going to look at the system strength. And ultimately, I think, historically, people vote with their feet. They vote with a product that they think will work better from a customer point of view, ultimately, higher margins and drive higher share. And so we got to do it again, but we've got a pretty good track record of doing this stuff. We've spent a lot of time on this. And hopefully, by the next time we talk, it will be out of the shoot and we'll be talking about how many deals we got lined up.\nSmedes Rose : And can I just ask you a quick other question? The difference between the gross room additions in the first quarter and then that room just seemed kind of wider than what we've seen. Is that -- was that just -- is that sort of a seasonal thing or was there something in particular on the deletion side that you can call out or...\nKevin Jacobs : Are you talking about the difference between -- if you do Q1 in the guidance, Smedes?\nSmedes Rose : Well, just the first quarter gross room additions and then the net room additions that seem just pickup...\nKevin Jacobs : No, there's -- no. Removals is right in line with normal. We'll end up about 1%, 1% and change for the year. Just the gross rooms from a timing perspective -- I mean, I think I don't want to repeat what Chris said earlier on the call. But I think from a timing perspective, for the full year, gross room additions were lower in the first quarter and deletions were about the same. So that's the difference.\nOperator: And the next question is from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Grambling : Maybe following up on some of your comments about the new brand launches, Spark and then it sounds like another one in the extended-stay. When you think about going into some of these lower-end chain scales, I think many of the peers often see higher attrition rates or deletion rates. What can you do to ensure that the attrition rates from your brands are more resilient long term? And have you seen any evidence of that from your current lower of chain scale brands such as Tru?\nChristopher Nassetta : No. You mean, attrition meaning losing hotels out of the system? No, I mean, here's the -- listen, and not to be too simplistic about it. But what we do is really made much easier by delivering commercial performance. So having great brands that resonate with customers, loyalty that connects the dots, that customers are engaged with, product and service in those particular brands that really resonates with customers. And ultimately, our commercial engines and commercial strategies that deliver the highest level of market share. And so if you look at our -- if you look at like Tru or Hampton almost -- I would say, almost 100%, I don't know, 90% to 100% of the deals that exit the system within those brands. And I don't think any Trus have exited the system that I'm aware of. It's a relatively new brand. I'm probably -- probably none. But Hampton is by our choice, meaning that their time is up. They're in a location or they're in a physical state that we just don't think works anymore. And so that's by our choice. We have very little attrition. And back to where I started, the reason we have very little attrition is our mega category brands are category killers. They drive incredibly high share. So as we think about Spark, as we think about our new extended-stay brand, we have to get it right, which we will. We have to drive really high share, which we will. The product has to really work for customers, which is what drives that. And people don't want to leave, right? So our history is super, super good in the mega categories. If you go through the whole list of all our extended, Home2, Homewood, Hampton, Tru, the attrition there is almost all. The vast, vast majority of it is by our choice.\nStephen Grambling : That's helpful context, and that's my one question.\nOperator: The next question is from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz : I wanted to just go back to Spark because obviously, a lot of enthusiasm and success and it's unlike things that you've done before. If we look at the makeup of the deals that you've put together, I'd love some color on what's in there. Are those independents that are looking for a brand? Are those switching from other brands for one reason or another? Are any of the hotels switching within your system into it that may have otherwise departed for one reason or another?\nChristopher Nassetta : Yes. Of the 300 -- I'll get this direction. Of the 300 bang around it, I would say it's almost all. It's very little of us. So there are a few Hamptons of the 300. So a teeny number of Hamptons that we would probably otherwise say will exit the system that we think for Spark will work even though they wouldn't work for Hampton. But that's a teeny tiny amount. The rest of it is almost -- there's a little bit of independent on that data point, but it's almost all coming from other brands in that -- in the economy space and spread around what you would guess. And I have some of that data but I'm not sharing it.\nDavid Katz : Fair enough and understood. My follow-up is when we look at the revenue intensity of adding in this category, how does that measure up with your other brands? Obviously, the upper upscale, a unit is generating more, right? But how does the fee structure and the revenue intensity of this measure up and add to your system?\nChristopher Nassetta : Yes. The fee structure is quite similar to other fee structures. They are smaller and it is at a lower rate. We think the rate here is probably $80 to $90 versus the net Tru, which is $120 -- in the $120s with Hampton being at like $140. So it's -- they're a similar size so a lot of the Trus and Hamptons, they're at a lower ADR by design. And so yes, per pound fees will be a little bit less and certainly versus upper upscale business. You have to remember in our world is we're trying to create a network effect. So this is a massive customer acquisition tool for us. There's 70 million or 80 million people traveling in this segment, half of whom are younger people that travel and this is all they can afford. And while we serve some of them, we're not serving many of them. So the opportunity is for us to get them hooked on our system early by giving them the best product that they can find in the economy space because every single hotel, every customer-facing element of the hotel has to be done or it doesn't get our name. And we regulate the gate. Nobody comes in. Nobody passes through the gate until that's done. And so the other thing to remember is it's an infinite yield. So we built -- we bring in tens of millions of new customers that are going to trade up. They're going to grow up and they're going to use our other products. They're going to trade in and around our products. And we built this brand with a lot of hard work and elbow grease from the standpoint of the deals that we're getting. While they may be per pound a little lighter, we're not paying for them. I mean, thus the infinite yield. There's no investment. We continue to build these incremental fee streams. And when you add up what the potential, I mean, I suspect 30 years ago, somebody said that about Hampton. Well, I mean, Hampton at that time was a $50 rate, and it's 100, 120-room hotel. How much money can that make you? Well, Hampton is a value well into the billions of dollars because turns out when you do a few thousand of them, it adds up. And the ultimate potential of Spark is bigger than Hampton because it's a bigger slice of the pie. So we're very excited about it. We think it is going to add not just new unit growth, but it's going to add significantly to earnings as it ramps up and ultimately to the overall value of the company.\nDavid Katz : Sounds like no meaningful key money there either?\nChristopher Nassetta : No.\nKevin Jacobs : Yes, I think David, just to add just a little bit, and Chris covered it, yes. I mean, the capital intensity of our -- in our business is much higher at the upper end, right? So the higher you go in the chain scale, the more the deals are competitive and you're contributing capital. And the other thing I'd say is why I think sort of working with you for a while, I think where you were headed with that. I think from a revenue intensity perspective, Chris described it. As you layer in these lower fee per room hotels, mathematically, of course, your fee per room does go down. But when we model it out over a long period of time, you'd be surprised the fees per room do not...\nChristopher Nassetta : Keep going up.\nKevin Jacobs : They keep going up over time, and we continue to grow at what we often talk about as algorithm. So if you take same-store sales plus NUG, the fees per room and the fee growth continues at that pace. And part of that is because of the non-RevPAR-driven fees that Chris mentioned earlier in the call, which we think will continue to grow at a higher rate than algorithm. So you put that all in your model and it's -- it's surprisingly steady/continues to grow. \nChristopher Nassetta : There is no year where fees per room are going down just because the arithmetic. And we continue to have RevPAR growth on the existing pool of assets that continues to go up. And yes, fees per room as we model it 5, 10 years out, just keep going up.\nOperator: The next question is from Robin Farley from UBS.\nRobin Farley : I wanted to ask a little bit about the business transient performance in the quarter. I know you talked about RevPAR being ahead of 2019 levels. But I wonder if you could give us a sense of where either occupancy or number of business transient nights in the quarter compared to Q1 of '19. It seemed like from kind of broader industry trends, that Q4 didn't show that much sequential improvement from Q3 in terms of that change versus 2019. And maybe you'll say, of course, it may not matter at all when you have RevPAR performance as strong as what you have. So I'm certainly not saying it's not a strong quarter, but I'm kind of curious what's going on with that business transient night piece event.\nChristopher Nassetta : Yes. On a global basis, business transient, actually fourth quarter to first quarter ticked up. So on a -- it was about -- in the fourth quarter, about 1.03 and it went to 1.04. But importantly, on an aggregate occupancy basis in the first quarter, for the first time, it actually got back or slightly above where it was at the prior peak. Now that's not a U.S., that's a global number. So why is that happening in the face of everything you're reading? And it's really simple, which is why I said it in the comments, it's SME. It's like what we're all filtering through is big corporate America. Big corporate America is worried about the world, all the uncertainty and maybe curbing some of their appetite for travel. Having said that, I've met with -- we had a big customer event, and I didn't get that impression even at a big corporate America. I think incrementally year-over-year, they're all traveling more but maybe not as much as they would have thought. But the SMEs continue, which are 85% of our business, continue to perform really, really well. And the big corporates weren't really back in any event. And so since they had not come back to prior levels, while they may recover more slowly, they're not, my impression from talking to a bunch of them, they're not really cutting because they already had cut so much and they hadn't built it back. They're just -- maybe it's flattening for them. But I said it many times over the last few years. We have, by choice, we were always quite dependent 80% of our business was SMEs. It's 85% now by choice, meaning we have shifted our mix because it's higher rated business, it's more resilient in the sense that it's more fragmented by the very nature of what it is. So business transient is alive and well. And I'd say in the first quarter, both the price was above and volume was at or slightly above, and that trend continues into Q2 although we're early in Q2.\nRobin Farley : Okay, great. Very helpful. And then just the other question, kind of a small one is your distribution through OTAs, I have to imagine that as business transient is coming back, that your OTA distribution is moving down compared to last year, just given that leisure is not as big a percent of total.\nChristopher Nassetta : It's normalizing. It's slightly elevated relative to pre-COVID but not much and has come down a bunch. And we expect probably by the end of the year, certainly into next, it will be normalized with where it was, which is where we want it to be.\nOperator: The next question is from Brandt Montour from Barclays.\nBrandt Montour : I was wondering if you could just dig in a little bit to the drivers of the conversion activity, taking Spark out of it. Chris, you mentioned potentially lower hotel transaction activity from financing headwinds putting pressure as well as financing being a headwind in and of itself for doing non-Spark hire and conversions. I guess could you stack that up against some of the maybe positive tailwinds, perhaps enforcement of brand standards across the industry, foresee more trade down or even more independents getting more nervous looking for brands? How do you look at all those factors on a net basis later into the year?\nKevin Jacobs : Yes, I'll take this one, Brandt. I think outside of Spark as we've covered that, I think you've got a couple of factors. One is yes, in sort of an environment where people are expecting demand to soften, they tend to seek out brands more often, and obviously, they tend to seek out the stronger brand. So it's being driven by somewhat of demand for independent hotels converting to brands. And then I think the other factor is in an environment where credit's tighter, a cash-flowing hotel, right, so acquiring a hotel and that's already cash-flowing, it's easier to finance than new construction. So I think those are the two primary drivers. And then you think about some of the things that are going on around the world. But they're generally driven by transactions and generally in a softening demand environment, easier to finance and more demand for the branded systems.\nOperator: The next question is from Bill Crow from Raymond James.\nBill Crow : As we think about the change to your guidance for 2023, how much of that is driven by areas outside the U.S.? And has there really been any change or any positive change to U.S. expectations?\nKevin Jacobs : Yes. I think, Bill, what you're seeing is it's kind of -- it's across the board. It's positive change to all regions. Largely, I think Chris covered this earlier in the call, largely concentrated with the demand strength continuing into the second quarter and us taking the second quarter up a little bit, a little bit in the third quarter and then the -- and if you think about pushing out the anticipated slowdown in the back half of the year, but there is improvement in the outlook in all regions, including the U.S.\nBill Crow : A follow-up. I'm going to actually switch my follow-up, and I want to actually address something you just said, Chris, which is that large corporates seem to be flat in their demand. And I'm just curious whether this early in the recovery, and I know there are issues going on in tech and financial services in particular, but does this give credence to that argument that business travel never fully recovers?\nChristopher Nassetta : I mean, I don't think so. Well, the #1 prima facie evidence it has. So I mean, Bill, but I just finished on a couple of questions ago, in the data in the first quarter, business travel has already recovered. I think what it means for us is in the intermediate term, as you get more certainty in the environment, there's upside in business travel, meaning we've done a good job of shifting to SMEs. With that shift, we're sort of, on a volume basis, back to where we were. Rate base is higher. The big corporates still have to travel. By the way, the big corporates are also not one size fits all. It's really where you see the impact is technology, banking consulting. If you look at a lot of the other big corporate sectors, they're still growing, but those sectors weighed it down. As those sectors stabilize and start to think about the future and being competitive and getting their sales forces back out and get out of cost-cutting mode, which they will, they always do, I look at it as upside. So I think when you wake up in a year or two and we're in a little -- we're in -- whenever we get to a more certain environment, hopefully it's sooner than later, I think the opportunity will be that business travel, both volume and price, will be higher than the prior peak. I think the same thing for the group business. I think this has done -- what's happened in the last three years has done nothing but reinforced -- I mean, we're definitely benefiting from a lot of pent-up demand, but it's done nothing but reinforce, as I talk to all of our group customers and the like, that the need for people to be congregating to do the things that they do in culture and collaboration and innovation and all of those fun things. So I kind of famously said when we get through this in like April, May of 2020, I think it will look a lot more like it did than it does. And I think that's -- I still think that. And I think the data largely supports it. If you look at the business mix, like this quarter versus pre COVID and the big segments of business transient, leisure transient and group, we're within a point. I mean, right now, the only difference is leisure is a point higher then group's a point lower. Otherwise, it's about where it was, right? And that's because group takes time to sort of -- to come back. And in the meantime, leisure has been strong. But ultimately, as we get strong high-rated groups back, we will continue to mix more of that in. So I do not personally believe there is credence to that argument. I think the data supports that argument at this moment.\nBill Crow : Look forward to seeing you early next month.\nChristopher Nassetta : Yes. Same.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChristopher Nassetta : Thank you, Chad. Thanks, everybody, for the time today. Interesting times with all -- the word of the day is uncertainty. But as you can see, we feel very good about what we delivered in the first quarter. We feel great about the second quarter. Frankly, we feel pretty good about the full year. We're making sure that we're keeping our eyes wide open about what's going on in the world. But we continue to do well and deliver, and most importantly, return more and more capital, which we'll continue to do. So thank you for the time, and we look forward to catching up with you after the quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Kevin Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 30% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis and increased 8% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by strong demand in APAC as well as continued strength in leisure and steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $641 million in the first quarter, up 43% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth across all regions as well as strong performance in Europe and Japan benefiting our ownership portfolio. Management and franchise fees grew 30% year-over-year, driven by continued RevPAR improvement. Continued good cost discipline further benefited results. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.24, increasing 75% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 21% year-over-year with performance continuing to be led by strong leisure demand. Both business transient and group RevPAR finished above 2019 peak levels for the second consecutive quarter, driven by strong rate growth. In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR increased 56% year-over-year and 35% versus 2019. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand at resort properties where RevPAR was up over 60% compared to peak levels. In Europe, RevPAR grew 68% year-over-year and was 13% higher than 2019. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, particularly from the U.S. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 32% year-over-year and 42% versus 2019, led by strong rate growth and group demand. In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR was up 91% year-over-year and down only 4% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 5% compared to 2019, 32 points better than prior quarter as demand recovery accelerated due to the lifting of COVID restrictions. The rest of the Asia Pacific region also saw a significant improvement with RevPAR, excluding China, up 19% versus 2019, representing an 11-point improvement versus prior quarter. Turning to development. Our pipeline grew year-over-year and sequentially and now totals 428,000 rooms with nearly 60% located outside the U.S. and over half under construction. Looking at the full year, despite the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, we still expect net unit growth between 5% and 5.5%. Moving to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 10% and 12% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $770 million and $790 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.54 and $1.59. For full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth of between 8% and 11%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.875 billion and $2.95 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $5.68 and $5.88. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of 15% -- $0.15 per share during the first quarter for a total of $41 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $600 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, and we expect to return between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the full year. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.  This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question, please. Chad, can we have our first question? And a little bit of mix as well, so the franchise business is a little more concentrated in the U.S. where RevPAR growth has not been as robust as outside the U.S. Are you talking about the difference between -- if you do Q1 in the guidance, Smedes? No, there's -- no. Removals is right in line with normal. We'll end up about 1%, 1% and change for the year. Just the gross rooms from a timing perspective -- I mean, I think I don't want to repeat what Chris said earlier on the call. But I think from a timing perspective, for the full year, gross room additions were lower in the first quarter and deletions were about the same. So that's the difference. Yes, I think David, just to add just a little bit, and Chris covered it, yes. I mean, the capital intensity of our -- in our business is much higher at the upper end, right? So the higher you go in the chain scale, the more the deals are competitive and you're contributing capital. And the other thing I'd say is why I think sort of working with you for a while, I think where you were headed with that. I think from a revenue intensity perspective, Chris described it. As you layer in these lower fee per room hotels, mathematically, of course, your fee per room does go down. But when we model it out over a long period of time, you'd be surprised the fees per room do not... They keep going up over time, and we continue to grow at what we often talk about as algorithm. So if you take same-store sales plus NUG, the fees per room and the fee growth continues at that pace. And part of that is because of the non-RevPAR-driven fees that Chris mentioned earlier in the call, which we think will continue to grow at a higher rate than algorithm. So you put that all in your model and it's -- it's surprisingly steady/continues to grow. Yes, I'll take this one, Brandt. I think outside of Spark as we've covered that, I think you've got a couple of factors. One is yes, in sort of an environment where people are expecting demand to soften, they tend to seek out brands more often, and obviously, they tend to seek out the stronger brand. So it's being driven by somewhat of demand for independent hotels converting to brands. And then I think the other factor is in an environment where credit's tighter, a cash-flowing hotel, right, so acquiring a hotel and that's already cash-flowing, it's easier to finance than new construction. So I think those are the two primary drivers. And then you think about some of the things that are going on around the world. But they're generally driven by transactions and generally in a softening demand environment, easier to finance and more demand for the branded systems. Yes. I think, Bill, what you're seeing is it's kind of -- it's across the board. It's positive change to all regions. Largely, I think Chris covered this earlier in the call, largely concentrated with the demand strength continuing into the second quarter and us taking the second quarter up a little bit, a little bit in the third quarter and then the -- and if you think about pushing out the anticipated slowdown in the back half of the year, but there is improvement in the outlook in all regions, including the U.S."

            "name": "Christopher Nassetta",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report that demand for travel remains strong, maintaining the trend that we saw in the back half of last year, which led to both our top and bottom line results finishing the quarter above the high end of our guidance. As we move forward, fundamentals remain strong, and we expect secular tailwinds to continue to support growth. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we're optimistic that the power of our network effect, our industry-leading RevPAR premiums and our fee-based capital-light business model will continue to drive strong operating performance, unit growth and meaningful cash flow, enabling us to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 30% year-over-year and 8% compared to 2019. Rate continued to drive growth, up 11% compared to 2019, and system-wide occupancy reached 68%, up from the prior quarter and just 2 points shy of peak levels. Globally, all segments outperformed expectations, and the lifting of COVID restrictions in China drove significant recovery in demand across Asia Pacific throughout the quarter. As a result, RevPAR in the month of March exceeded 2019 levels across all regions and segments for the first time since the pandemic began. Given our strong results and positive momentum, we're raising both top and bottom line guidance for the full year, which Kevin will cover in more detail in just a few minutes. Turning to the segment details. Leisure trends remained strong throughout the quarter with RevPAR surpassing 2019 by approximately 15%, ahead of prior quarter performance. Strong leisure transient demand continue to drive rates up in the mid-teens above 2019 and occupancy fully recovered back to 2019 levels, driven by the surge in travel in Asia Pacific. Business transient also continued to improve with RevPAR up 4% from 2019, reflecting the resiliency of business travel, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, which remained roughly 85% of our segment mix. Recovery in group remains robust with RevPAR finishing roughly in line with 2019 with steady improvement each month in the quarter and March exceeding 2019 by 5%. Demand for future bookings also remained strong with full year group position up 28% year-over-year and 3% versus 2019. Additionally, new group leads ended in the quarter 13% higher than 2019, an increase of 6 points compared to prior quarter. Looking at the full year, based on the better-than-expected Q1 results, the accelerated demand across Asia and continued positive momentum in group, we now expect full year system-wide top line growth between 8% and 11% versus 2022, assuming some slowdown in the back half of the year due to macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in the U.S. Turning to development. In the first quarter, we opened 64 properties totaling over 9,000 rooms, celebrating several milestones, including the opening of our 500th hotel in China, our 100th addition to the Tapestry Collection and the opening of the Canopy Toronto Yorkville, the Lifestyle brand's debut in Canada. We also opened 2 new Embassy Suite resort properties in Virginia Beach and Aruba with the Aruba addition marking the brand's 10th international property. And after recently being ranked the #1 Hotel Franchise in Entrepreneur Magazine's Franchise 500 for a record-breaking 14th year in a row, Hampton by Hilton expanded its global presence to 37 countries with the brand's first property in Ecuador. While we expect to see some impact from the current financing environment, we are encouraged by the progress on the signings and starts front. We signed approximately 25,000 rooms during the quarter, growing our pipeline to a record 428,000 rooms, more than half of which are currently under construction. Signings in the quarter outpaced prior year across all regions. And conversion signings in the quarter were 24% higher than prior year, benefiting in part from the rollout of our newly-launched brand, Spark by Hilton. The initial interest in Spark has been tremendous. We currently have more than 300 deals in various stages of negotiation, and our teams are working hard to deliver this exciting new premium economy conversion brand with hotels opening later this year. Hilton Garden Inn also continues to be an engine of global growth with 14 new signings across 6 countries in the quarter and over 60 working deals in 22 countries. Additionally, in April, we announced the signing of the Waldorf Astoria Jaipur, marking the debut of the brand in India and further demonstrating our commitment to expanding our world-class luxury brands across the globe. Construction starts for the quarter totaled over 19,000 rooms, up nearly 20% from prior year, and starts in the U.S. were up more than 50% year-over-year. Our global under construction pipeline is up 8% compared to March 2022. And per STR, we continue to lead the industry in total rooms under construction. Taking all this into account, we still expect to deliver net unit growth within our guidance range this year and remain confident in our ability to return to 6% to 7% net unit growth over the next couple of years. On the loyalty front, Hilton Honors grew to more than 158 million members, a 19% increase year-over-year and remains the fastest-growing hotel loyalty program. In the quarter, Hilton Honors members accounted for 62% of occupancy, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. Additionally, in an effort to further provide our loyal guests with an elevated wellness experience, in April, we announced the international expansion of our partnership with Peloton, bringing Peloton bikes to properties across the UK, Germany, Canada and Puerto Rico, building on our existing partnership to make Peloton bikes available in all U.S. hotels. As one of the world's largest hospitality companies, we recognize Hilton has the responsibility to protect the planet and to support the communities we serve to ensure our hotel destinations remain vibrant and resilient for generations of travelers to come. In early April, we published our 2022 Travel with Purpose Report, outlining our latest progress towards our 2030 environmental, social and governance goals, including our efforts to reduce our environmental impact while creating engines of opportunity within our communities and preserving the beautiful destinations where we live, work and travel. We remain committed to driving responsible travel and tourism globally while furthering positive environmental and social impact and sound governance across our operations and our communities. All of our success would not be possible without the dedicated efforts of our talented team, and we continue to be recognized for our remarkable workplace culture. Recently, Great Place to Work and Fortune ranked Hilton the #2 workplace in the U.S., our eighth consecutive year on the list, and once again, the top-ranked hospitality company, an accomplishment I'm truly proud of. Overall, despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that our world-class brands, dedicated team members and resilient business model have us incredibly well positioned for the future.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the quarter and our expectations for the full year. Yes, a really good question. Obviously, I think I used the macroeconomic uncertainty two or three times for a reason because there is an uncertain environment. I mean, what we're seeing today is, as you heard in what you saw in our numbers and in the prepared comments is very good strength across all our segments. Leisure continues to be super strong. Business transient in the quarter, both demand and pricing, has returned to prior peak levels and group is motoring on its way. It's just longer in gestation to get there. But based on the trends, it's going to get there in the second half of the year, I think, with a great deal of certainty. So we are not -- you didn't really ask it this way, but I think part of it is we're not seeing any cracks in terms of demand patterns. There is a lot of momentum. I sit at this very table every Monday morning with my entire executive committee, representing every region of the world. And the first question I ask, are you seeing any cracks? Any issues with demand broadly? Any issues regionally? Any issues from a segment point of view? And the truth is we're just not seeing it. Having said that, we know here in the U.S. and in many other places around the world, there's an inflation issue. Now it's being -- it is being managed. It's becoming -- it is in the process of normalizing, particularly here in the U.S., but it's not there. And the Fed has said it's going to deal with it. I believe that -- I take them at their word. And I think ultimately, that means you're going to continue to have a slowing of the broader economic environment that, at some point, has to have some impact on us. It hasn't yet for a bunch of reasons, I suggested: one, I still think we have a lot of pent-up demand; two, we are still benefiting from a secular shift in spending patterns broadly. So while people may have a little less to spend, they're spending more of it on experiences and a lot less of it on things. You see that throughout the economy. And international travel is finally, with China opening up, while it's not back anywhere near where it has been, international travel is really on a steep up-slope. And all of those things are keeping the momentum in demand in the business. Recognizing also, by the way, that capacity additions are at historical lows and are probably going to stay there for a while. So when I said very quickly in my comments, fundamentals remain strong, I mean, fundamentals are supply and demand. Demand is good for the reasons I suggest that supply in the industry is anemic. Thankfully, we get a lot more than our fair share of the supply, so that's good for us. But the basic fundamentals in the business are good. Having said all of that, we do expect things will slow down. You asked a question which I'm actually going to answer, which is, do I feel any differently than I did sitting here a quarter ago. And I would say, yes, I would say number one, the economy appears to be more resilient. Inflation is being tamed. I have a higher degree of confidence at this point. I'm not the right person to ask, but well, I'll tell you what I think. I have a higher degree of confidence that the Fed will land the plane reasonably well and that we're not going to have a deep dark kind of recession. We're going to have a slowdown, maybe a recession. It feels a lot more like it will be reasonably modest at this point. So I feel better about that. And I definitely feel like things have been pushed out a little bit. One, just time has gone by. We have now a quarter under our belt. We're deep into understanding half of the year. I mean, we're not done. There's a bunch of the second quarter left, but we have pretty good sight lines at this point into Q2. And that feels like the momentum is continuing. So you get a half a year sort of under your belt. It gives you more confidence. And so I feel better about, thus why we increased our guidance on the top line and bottom line because I feel like there's enough momentum in our business. The economy broadly is pretty resilient. There's more confidence in the Fed being able to sort of do this without wreaking too much havoc. So I'd say net-net, yes, I feel a bit better. Having said that, we did and I said it intentionally in the prepared comments, we do assume because we are sentient and we know what's going on, that at some point, you will see some slowing. I think realistically, it's more late third quarter and into the fourth quarter. I honestly think there's a chance it kicks into next year, given the broader momentum and the strength of the consumer broadly. But I don't know. And so what we've tried to do in our guidance is, build in an expectation that this -- these efforts of the Fed here and in other parts of the world will eventually work and that we're going to see some, at least, modest slowdown. And so that's sort of what -- we feel better than we did. We still think there's a lot of uncertainty, and we've tried to factor for that in our guidance in the second half of the year. Correct. Yes. I mean, the way to think about those is those are normalizing in growth rates, above algorithm growth, above typical growth you would assume sort of on a same-store basis. But we're still particularly because of Omicron, on the fee side, we have a supercharged fee growth rate in the first quarter. But I think the way to think about, over the intermediate, even longer term, is we think all of those ancillary license fees and otherwise, they're going to grow better than our typical algorithm growth. You're just -- yes, you have some year-over-year normalization going on in Omicron impact. Yes. I mean, it's early. So we've obviously been talking to a lot of our ownership community as the banking issues have sort of taken hold. And I would say there's a broad range that anecdotally go from, we haven't seen much impact. We're still getting finance. As you can see in our numbers in starts in the U.S. being so far up. Now part of that was before the banking, the regional local banking set of issues, but part of it was after. They're still getting the best owners with the best relationships are getting their deals done, and our market share in a tougher environment goes up. So proportionately relative to others in the industry, we typically do even better. But we also have folks that are saying very hard to find the money and some in the middle that are saying like they're talking to their banks and their banks are saying, \"Hey, we're going to be there for you. Just give me like 90 days. Let me see how this all plays out.\" And so I think it's early to know. I think being objective about it, which I always am trying to be, I think the Fed seems to be managing through this reasonably well. There's some ongoing things today or this week going on, but I think the Fed, I think, is pretty committed to making sure there isn't sort of a run on regional banks broadly. So I think we're in reasonably good shape that way. But I think that the net result is for a period of time, there'll be less credit available, okay? I still think we'll get more than our fair share of it because our brands are better performing, and we'll see our share go up as we historically do when times get tougher for financing, et cetera. But it's hard to believe that in the short to intermediate term, there's not going to be some impact. It hasn't shown up. It didn't show up in the first quarter. We haven't seen it yet, but I think in terms of pipeline, people, I think our expectation at this point for the year is the pipeline is going to keep growing. The bigger question is going to be the conversion under construction. In the first quarter, it was very, very good, as you heard, in the data. I think that will get more challenging. I think it just stands to reason that will get more challenging. And so listen, the good news for us is we tend to get -- our share goes up. It's a big world. While China has been a little bit slower to sort of pick up steam on the development side, it is picking up steam, I think, particularly as we think about next year, I think it's going to be a big net contributor. And conversions are -- have been and continue to be a big focus of ours. We think we'll do meaningfully more as a percentage of overall delivery this year as conversion somewhat aided by this year a little bit, but a lot, I think, next year by Spark, which is 100% conversion, very low cost of entry in a relative very, very lightly, if dependent at all, on the banking community. So that's not why we did Spark. We did Spark for all the right reasons, to better serve, create a bigger and better network effect, but just in time management, the timing of it actually is quite good. As we said, it's not going to do a lot for this year, but I think over -- starting next year and beyond, it will add significantly. But the net of all that, Joe, is, again, answering -- I'm trying to give a little bit of color across the board. We do expect that what's going on in the banking system, particularly for limited service, which is disproportionately financed by the regional and local banks, that they're going to pull in their horns. They're going to survive. Most of them are going to get through this, but there's going to be less credit available, and that's going to slow things down a bit. Should be, yes. It should be mathematically, yes. The algorithm is, as you know, so the same-store plus unit growth. And we've been delivering on average even through COVID, 5-ish, maybe a tick over, even in an environment that is being impacted by some of the things I just described. We believe we'll continue to do that as we manage our way over the next couple of years back up to the 6% to 7%. And so even in a no growth same-store environment, which is not certainly what we're experiencing now for the record, as you can see, but even in that environment, fees would continue to grow with unit growth. Yes. I mean, that's the right question to ask. And that's why I said, yes, we do expect to see some impact. But I also said, maybe I backed into it but I'll say it more directly, we feel good about being in that range you described. We've been around 5 through the toughest down cycle in recorded history. Through COVID, we've stayed sort of 5-ish or a tick above. And we think over the next period of time, as these things sort of work their way through the system, that we'll be able to say there. How are we going to do it? Well, one, we're going to gain share because our products perform better, and we have the highest market share brands in the business. We're going to keep pushing market share higher. And so while there's going to be potentially less new build activity domestically, we will plan to work hard to get an even larger share of that. Conversions, we do believe that we're uniquely suited certainly relative to The Great Recession by having not only more shots on goal in terms of brands. But Spark, again, there's -- long term, we think Spark is probably the most disruptive thing that we'll have ever done in terms of giving customers, at that price point, a really good product. But it's also, the timing of it is convenient and helpful because it depends very little on financing. Most of the other conversions still depend on financing. A lot of conversions, not all, but a lot of conversions do happen around asset transactions where people say I'm a buyer and a seller and I'm going to change brands and upgrade properties. We'll still convert a bunch of other types of properties that -- where they're not changing ownership, but no change -- lower change of ownership puts a little pressure on that. But Spark is I guess that we'll keep giving in the sense of unit growth because, again, you're talking about 20,000 rooms. You're talking about a $2 million sort of bogey for somebody to convert and get into our system versus even at the lowest price point, newbuilds that require financing and/or writing checks of $10 million, $15 million or, in most cases, much higher than that. So conversions will play a big part in it. And as I already said, it's a big world. So what's going on here in the U.S. is with the banking system is unlike The Great Recession where the whole financial system around the world was sort of imperiled in free fall, this really at the moment is more of a U.S. thing, obviously touched Europe a little bit and Switzerland, but it has largely been sort of continued to be a U.S. thing. And so you have the opportunities around the whole rest of the world. Notably, as I said, China, in the sense that China is probably taking a quarter or two more. So I think China won't contribute what I would have hoped it would this year, but I think it will be made up for next in '24 and '25 because the engines are really cranking up. It's just a process. So it will be conversions, international growth and increased market share of what does get done in the U.S. The other thing that is going on is we launched Spark. We're getting ready, and I'll maybe tickle the ivories a little bit. We're getting ready to launch another brand sort of at the -- in the extended-stay space at the lower end, mid-scale, very low end of mid-scale, below home to that we have -- we've been working with our ownership community and customers on that while it will be a newbuild product, it will be a very efficient build cost. So again, the things -- my history of this living through The Great Recession, all that is your lower cost to build products that have -- that are very high margin because people make the most money doing it and they're the lowest risk and they're the easiest financed. Those are the ones that get going the fastest. And so again, we didn't develop this brand that we're getting ready to launch, hopefully, in the next 30 or 60 days because of this. We launched because customers want it, owners want to build it. But again, it won't have any effect this year but starting probably the latter part of '24, more likely '25 as people look at a brand that can deliver just astronomical margins on a very efficient per unit build cost, we think it will build a lot of excitement. Home2 has been off the hooks in demand throughout all of COVID and otherwise because people make -- such customers love it, it's very high margin. We think customers are going to love this. It's something different. It's at a lower price point. But the margins are much even higher than that. And so again, it will take time to gestate that, but we think that is a mega brand opportunity for us that as we think about more likely '25, '26, even in an environment that's been more challenging -- is more challenging from a financing point of view, as the financing markets come back and they always do, it's those products that really get done fastest. And so we feel good about being around 5 and headed back to 6 to 7 over the next couple of years, and it will be a combo platter of all of those things that you said and that I just spoke to. We were already seeing it pre-COVID, where there was just a demand for workforce housing and people -- more mobility in their lives and they wanted to be places and work from different places. And they didn't -- they were going to be there long enough to commit. They're like, get an apartment and pay a one year's deposit and all that fun stuff. And so we are already seeing demand that was outstripping supply. And then COVID hit. And while a lot of things have normalized, and I've talked about this on prior calls a bunch of times, the one thing that happened is it accelerated the idea of mobility. While the office environment is normalizing, a lot of people are going back. It's not exactly what it was. More people are going to be remote as a percentage of the workforce permanently. More are going to have flexibility and sort of different times of year, times of the week, Mondays and Fridays. And all of that is continuing to just -- as those patterns shift, it's building more and more demand against a limited amount of supply. And so the fundamentals we think are just great. The way I think about the product that we're developing, and I'm getting ahead of myself, but it's coming really soon. I mean, down we have -- we've built it. We've done 99% of the work. It's almost a hybrid. It's like an apartment efficiency meets hotel. And I'd say it's almost like 60-40. It's more apartment efficiency. There's so many workforce housing needs that are just unmet with this kind of product for somebody who needs to be somewhere 30, 60, 90, 120 days. So you're talking about average length of stay of probably 20 to 30 days on average versus most of the core extended-stay brands are like 5 to 10 maybe, somewhere in that range, if you look at the industry. So it's a different demand base, different types of locations, which is why we love it because we're not serving it, meaning it's not competitive with what we're doing with Home2 and certainly not competitive with Homewood because it's serving a totally different need, mostly in totally different markets. And as I said, we -- I didn't intend to go this far, sorry. But this is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hotels over time. This is not like we're going to do 50 or 100 of these. I mean, you'll wake up over time in 10 years, and will -- it will be like Home2. We'll have 4, 5, 6. We'll have a lot of these because we think the need is there now and growing. And we -- while a lot of people are doing things in this arena, I think we've proven by launching brands that we do uniquely have done it pretty well to launch brands and get to scale and build network effect, not just broadly for the company but within brands. And we've done that, I think, as well or better than anybody. And I think we have an opportunity to do it here. And our system delivers. The system delivers the highest market share in the business. So if you're an owner thinking about I'm going to build a similar product somewhere else, I mean, you're going to look at the system strength. And ultimately, I think, historically, people vote with their feet. They vote with a product that they think will work better from a customer point of view, ultimately, higher margins and drive higher share. And so we got to do it again, but we've got a pretty good track record of doing this stuff. We've spent a lot of time on this. And hopefully, by the next time we talk, it will be out of the shoot and we'll be talking about how many deals we got lined up. No. You mean, attrition meaning losing hotels out of the system? No, I mean, here's the -- listen, and not to be too simplistic about it. But what we do is really made much easier by delivering commercial performance. So having great brands that resonate with customers, loyalty that connects the dots, that customers are engaged with, product and service in those particular brands that really resonates with customers. And ultimately, our commercial engines and commercial strategies that deliver the highest level of market share. And so if you look at our -- if you look at like Tru or Hampton almost -- I would say, almost 100%, I don't know, 90% to 100% of the deals that exit the system within those brands. And I don't think any Trus have exited the system that I'm aware of. It's a relatively new brand. I'm probably -- probably none. But Hampton is by our choice, meaning that their time is up. They're in a location or they're in a physical state that we just don't think works anymore. And so that's by our choice. We have very little attrition. And back to where I started, the reason we have very little attrition is our mega category brands are category killers. They drive incredibly high share. So as we think about Spark, as we think about our new extended-stay brand, we have to get it right, which we will. We have to drive really high share, which we will. The product has to really work for customers, which is what drives that. And people don't want to leave, right? So our history is super, super good in the mega categories. If you go through the whole list of all our extended, Home2, Homewood, Hampton, Tru, the attrition there is almost all. The vast, vast majority of it is by our choice. Yes. Of the 300 -- I'll get this direction. Of the 300 bang around it, I would say it's almost all. It's very little of us. So there are a few Hamptons of the 300. So a teeny number of Hamptons that we would probably otherwise say will exit the system that we think for Spark will work even though they wouldn't work for Hampton. But that's a teeny tiny amount. The rest of it is almost -- there's a little bit of independent on that data point, but it's almost all coming from other brands in that -- in the economy space and spread around what you would guess. And I have some of that data but I'm not sharing it. Yes. The fee structure is quite similar to other fee structures. They are smaller and it is at a lower rate. We think the rate here is probably $80 to $90 versus the net Tru, which is $120 -- in the $120s with Hampton being at like $140. So it's -- they're a similar size so a lot of the Trus and Hamptons, they're at a lower ADR by design. And so yes, per pound fees will be a little bit less and certainly versus upper upscale business. You have to remember in our world is we're trying to create a network effect. So this is a massive customer acquisition tool for us. There's 70 million or 80 million people traveling in this segment, half of whom are younger people that travel and this is all they can afford. And while we serve some of them, we're not serving many of them. So the opportunity is for us to get them hooked on our system early by giving them the best product that they can find in the economy space because every single hotel, every customer-facing element of the hotel has to be done or it doesn't get our name. And we regulate the gate. Nobody comes in. Nobody passes through the gate until that's done. And so the other thing to remember is it's an infinite yield. So we built -- we bring in tens of millions of new customers that are going to trade up. They're going to grow up and they're going to use our other products. They're going to trade in and around our products. And we built this brand with a lot of hard work and elbow grease from the standpoint of the deals that we're getting. While they may be per pound a little lighter, we're not paying for them. I mean, thus the infinite yield. There's no investment. We continue to build these incremental fee streams. And when you add up what the potential, I mean, I suspect 30 years ago, somebody said that about Hampton. Well, I mean, Hampton at that time was a $50 rate, and it's 100, 120-room hotel. How much money can that make you? Well, Hampton is a value well into the billions of dollars because turns out when you do a few thousand of them, it adds up. And the ultimate potential of Spark is bigger than Hampton because it's a bigger slice of the pie. So we're very excited about it. We think it is going to add not just new unit growth, but it's going to add significantly to earnings as it ramps up and ultimately to the overall value of the company. No. Keep going up. There is no year where fees per room are going down just because the arithmetic. And we continue to have RevPAR growth on the existing pool of assets that continues to go up. And yes, fees per room as we model it 5, 10 years out, just keep going up. Yes. On a global basis, business transient, actually fourth quarter to first quarter ticked up. So on a -- it was about -- in the fourth quarter, about 1.03 and it went to 1.04. But importantly, on an aggregate occupancy basis in the first quarter, for the first time, it actually got back or slightly above where it was at the prior peak. Now that's not a U.S., that's a global number. So why is that happening in the face of everything you're reading? And it's really simple, which is why I said it in the comments, it's SME. It's like what we're all filtering through is big corporate America. Big corporate America is worried about the world, all the uncertainty and maybe curbing some of their appetite for travel. Having said that, I've met with -- we had a big customer event, and I didn't get that impression even at a big corporate America. I think incrementally year-over-year, they're all traveling more but maybe not as much as they would have thought. But the SMEs continue, which are 85% of our business, continue to perform really, really well. And the big corporates weren't really back in any event. And so since they had not come back to prior levels, while they may recover more slowly, they're not, my impression from talking to a bunch of them, they're not really cutting because they already had cut so much and they hadn't built it back. They're just -- maybe it's flattening for them. But I said it many times over the last few years. We have, by choice, we were always quite dependent 80% of our business was SMEs. It's 85% now by choice, meaning we have shifted our mix because it's higher rated business, it's more resilient in the sense that it's more fragmented by the very nature of what it is. So business transient is alive and well. And I'd say in the first quarter, both the price was above and volume was at or slightly above, and that trend continues into Q2 although we're early in Q2. It's normalizing. It's slightly elevated relative to pre-COVID but not much and has come down a bunch. And we expect probably by the end of the year, certainly into next, it will be normalized with where it was, which is where we want it to be. I mean, I don't think so. Well, the #1 prima facie evidence it has. So I mean, Bill, but I just finished on a couple of questions ago, in the data in the first quarter, business travel has already recovered. I think what it means for us is in the intermediate term, as you get more certainty in the environment, there's upside in business travel, meaning we've done a good job of shifting to SMEs. With that shift, we're sort of, on a volume basis, back to where we were. Rate base is higher. The big corporates still have to travel. By the way, the big corporates are also not one size fits all. It's really where you see the impact is technology, banking consulting. If you look at a lot of the other big corporate sectors, they're still growing, but those sectors weighed it down. As those sectors stabilize and start to think about the future and being competitive and getting their sales forces back out and get out of cost-cutting mode, which they will, they always do, I look at it as upside. So I think when you wake up in a year or two and we're in a little -- we're in -- whenever we get to a more certain environment, hopefully it's sooner than later, I think the opportunity will be that business travel, both volume and price, will be higher than the prior peak. I think the same thing for the group business. I think this has done -- what's happened in the last three years has done nothing but reinforced -- I mean, we're definitely benefiting from a lot of pent-up demand, but it's done nothing but reinforce, as I talk to all of our group customers and the like, that the need for people to be congregating to do the things that they do in culture and collaboration and innovation and all of those fun things. So I kind of famously said when we get through this in like April, May of 2020, I think it will look a lot more like it did than it does. And I think that's -- I still think that. And I think the data largely supports it. If you look at the business mix, like this quarter versus pre COVID and the big segments of business transient, leisure transient and group, we're within a point. I mean, right now, the only difference is leisure is a point higher then group's a point lower. Otherwise, it's about where it was, right? And that's because group takes time to sort of -- to come back. And in the meantime, leisure has been strong. But ultimately, as we get strong high-rated groups back, we will continue to mix more of that in. So I do not personally believe there is credence to that argument. I think the data supports that argument at this moment. Yes. Same. Thank you, Chad. Thanks, everybody, for the time today. Interesting times with all -- the word of the day is uncertainty. But as you can see, we feel very good about what we delivered in the first quarter. We feel great about the second quarter. Frankly, we feel pretty good about the full year. We're making sure that we're keeping our eyes wide open about what's going on in the world. But we continue to do well and deliver, and most importantly, return more and more capital, which we'll continue to do. So thank you for the time, and we look forward to catching up with you after the quarter."

Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Nassetta: Thank you. Jill. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. Our third quarter results continued to demonstrate the strength of our business model as strong net unit growth helped drive solid bottom line performance. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS both exceeded the high end of our guidance, despite softer-than-expected RevPAR performance. We opened more hotel rooms than any other quarter in the history of our company and surpassed 8,000 hotels in our system. We also reached a milestone 200 million Hilton Honors members in the quarter, as our award-winning program, industry-leading brands and exceptional service continued to increase guest loyalty. Turning to results. Third quarter system-wide RevPAR increased 1.4% year-over-year, below our guidance range due to slower ramp in September following Labor Day, weather impacts, unfavorable calendar shifts and ongoing labor disputes in the US. Business transient RevPAR increased 2% with growth across both large corporates and small and medium-sized businesses. Leisure trends continue to normalize with RevPAR declining modestly from post-pandemic peaks. Group RevPAR was more than 5% year-over-year, led by strong demand for both corporate and social meetings and events. For the full year, group position is up 10% with group position in 2025 and 2026, up low double-digits to mid-teens. Adjusting for holiday and calendar shifts, we estimate systemwide RevPAR grew at 2.3% in the quarter, just slightly softer than the second quarter and with all segments increasing. On an adjusted basis, leisure transient RevPAR increased nearly 2%, driven largely by solid trends across Continental Europe. In the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR growth largely in line with third quarter, driven by strong group bookings, continued business transient recovery and favorable calendar shifts, partially offset by the election and ongoing labor disputes in the U.S. Weekday pace for October is tracking up more than 300 basis points versus September's weekday pace, driven by solid business transient performance and group strength. Company meetings and convention business continue to grow as a percentage of mix driving longer booking windows. Given year-to-date performance and fourth quarter expectations, we expect forecast full year RevPAR growth of 2%, 2.5%, and full year adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 10%, demonstrating the continued resiliency of our business model. Turning to development in the quarter. We opened a record 531 hotels, totaling more than 36,000 rooms, and achieved the highest net unit growth in our history at 7.8%. We marked several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 8,000th hotel worldwide, our 900th hotel in Asia-Pacific and our 900th hotel in EMEA. Home2 Suites, which has more than doubled in supply in the last five years, opened its 700th hotel and continues to have the largest new development pipeline in the industry. We continue to expand our lifestyle portfolio, opening a number of new hotels in the quarter, including the Graduate Auburn and Graduate Princeton, the first two openings under our newly acquired Graduate brand. We also introduced several brands in new markets around the world, including Spark in Canada, Embassy Suites in UAE, Canopy in Japan and Hampton in Switzerland, demonstrating the strong value of our industry-leading brands and delivering for owners. We welcome nearly 400 luxury properties through our exclusive agreement with Small Luxury Hotels of the World. These properties, spanning 70 different countries, provide Honors members even more opportunities to book unique luxury experiences and sought-after destinations across the globe. Including SLH and our existing luxury properties, we now have one of the largest luxury hotel portfolios in the industry. Conversions accounted for 60% of openings in the quarter, driven by the addition of SLH properties and continued momentum from Spark. We opened more than 20 Spark hotels in the quarter and now have over 6,000 Spark rooms in supply just a year after the brand opened its first property. Spark now has opened hotels in the US and the UK and Canada, and we recently announced plans to open hotels in Germany and Austria before the end of the year. The brand's pipeline is three times larger than its existing supply, and we expect continued launches in international markets to further boost Spark's trajectory, positioning us well for future growth in the premium economy space. In the quarter, we signed 28,000 rooms, expanding our pipeline to more than 492,000 rooms, which is up 8% year-over-year, excluding partnerships, our pipeline also increased from the second quarter. We signed three luxury deals in Greece, Japan and the UAE and 35 lifestyle properties, including a record 15 Curios. Conversions accounted for more than 30% of signings in the quarter, driven by the strength of Spark and continued momentum across Curio, Tapestry and DoubleTree. Construction starts remained strong, up 21%, excluding acquisitions and partnerships. We remain on track to exceed prior levels of starts by year-end with meaningful growth across both the US and international markets. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction, and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more 20% of industry share and nearly four times our existing share of supply. As a result of our strong pipeline and under construction activity, we continue to expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5% for the full year and 6% to 7% for 2025. We continue to be recognized for our culture and award-winning brands. During the quarter, we were named the top hospitality workplace in Latin America and Asia by Great Place to Work, adding to the more than 560 Great Place to Work Awards and nearly 60 number one wins around the world since 2016. We're also proudly named the number two workplace on the 2024 People Magazine Companies That Care list and recently recognizes Time's Best Hotel Brand of 2024. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the milestones we've achieved, our full network of brands to continue to be an engine of opportunity for our guests, our owners and our team members, we're excited about our growth into future. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results for the quarter and our expectations for the full year.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 1.4% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by strong international performance and continued recovery in group. Adjusted EBITDA was $904 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected non-RevPAR fee growth, lower corporate expense and some timing items. Management franchise fees grew 8% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.92. Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR was up 1%, driven by a strong group performance. In the Americas outside of the US, third quarter RevPAR increased 4% year-over-year, driven by strong results in urban markets, particularly in Mexico. In Europe, RevPAR grew 7% year-over-year driven by key summer events, including the Olympics in France and the European soccer championships in Germany. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 3% year-over-year, led by occupancy gains in Qatar and Riyadh. In the Asia-Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR was down 3% year-over-year. RevPAR in APAC ex-China increased 4%, led by strong performance in India. However, China RevPAR declined 9% in the quarter with difficult year-over-year domestic travel comparisons, disruptions due to typhoons and limited international inbound travel negatively affecting results. Turning to development. We ended the quarter with approximately 492,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 8% year-over-year with approximately 60% of those rooms located outside of the US and nearly half under construction. For the full year, we expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5%. Moving to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 2% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $804 million and $834 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.57 and $1.67. For full year 2024, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 2.5%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.375 billion and $3.405 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.93 and $7.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $37 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $2.4 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And for the full year, we expect to return approximately $3 billion. Further details on our third quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good morning Chris, Kevin, Jill. Back in March at your Investor Day, which feels like a long time ago for a lot of different reasons, you gave a 2025 EBITDA target of $3.69 billion. When you look at that number and the drivers getting there, what's different about 2025 as you sit here today versus this past March? I guess, in other words, a few in the industry are in this 1% to 2% RevPAR growth range for next year. Do you still look at that level of EBITDA is achievable or do you need RevPAR to be somewhat higher than 1% to 2% to get there?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, that's a good question. Obviously, it's a tad early to be getting into 2025 guidance, as you know, we would typically do that at the end of -- when we report year end at the beginning of next year. But I will give you a high-level sense of it. I mean we are in the sort of early-ish stages of budget season, so lots of work to do. But I would say I have a reasonably -- like most things, I have a reasonably strong view of where I think things will end up. And so I'd start with sort of like how do we feel broadly about 2025 and I would say we feel pretty good about it. I've been doing this for longer than I'm going to admit, maybe close to 40 years. I've rarely seen sort of a stronger consensus view on the macro, particularly here in the U.S. But I think broadly -- and that macro view is sort of, I think, the word resiliency I used to describe our business. I think that word is getting used a lot to describe the economy. And I think there is a very broad consensus view that the economy will continue to be -- it obviously has been slowing because that's what the Fed has been trying to do here in the U.S. and to a degree, in other parts of the world, but focus on the U.S. But it remains strong, resilient, and showing positive growth. And I think our -- the consensus for you is that next year will be more of that, that we'll have positive economic growth. The odds of a recession at this point, I think, are quite low. If you look again at consensus view, I'm not an economist, but that's the view. And I talk to a lot of people, and I would generally agree with the view. So, I think as we think about as a backdrop, thinking about 2025, what's going to be the macro, which can drive a bunch of our business, obviously. We feel pretty good about it. I think when you think about how that's going to add up, and I'll sort of give you the punch line and then I'll break it down a little bit by regions and segments. I mean I think the punchline is my best sense, again, early in our budget season, is that next year is going to look a lot like this year from a same-store growth point of view. Now I think we'll get there a little bit differently. But I would say at this point, I think next year, we'll end up when we're sitting here a year from now, we'll be saying it felt a lot like 2024. If you break that down regionally, I think it's -- again, at a high level, where I think it ends up is the US ends up pretty similar to what we're experiencing this year. I think if you look at Asia-Pacific, I think it will be better in in part because comps China are going to get easier and there's a lot of stimulus occurring there. So I do think China will have a better year. And China -- I mean, APAC ex China remains quite strong, as Kevin suggested in his comments. And we don't see a lot that's going to disrupt that. And we have some comp benefits, particularly in the third quarter in weather in in typhoons Japan and China that will be a benefit. So, I think APAC will be better. I think EMEA will be a little bit less good than it's been. I think it's still going to be very good, to be clear. My guess is that it will probably still lead the pack in RevPAR growth in terms of our mega regions around the world. So it's not that I see a problem there. But I do think it will be somewhat less growth than we saw this year. And when you blend it all together, US about the same. APAC a little bit better. EMEA may be a little bit worse. I think you end up kind of about where you are. If you break it down by segments, again, I mean I'm homogenizing a lot of stuff together. But I think it's again a similar story, maybe with a little bit of nuance. I think on the group side, you're going to continue to see really good strength. I said we're up in the low to mid-teens in terms of our position going into next year, so we feel really good we'll cross over with more than half the business on the books. And booking windows are extending because there's just not enough supply relative to the demand. So I think you're going to see both demand growth and pricing growth in the group segment. I think in business transient, which will be, I think, in in second place terms of the pecking order of growth. Again, broadly, I think you're going to continue to see business transient grind up. I do think next year, we will likely surpass prior peaks of 2019 in terms of demand levels. So you will see increase in demand. All the anecdotal and hard evidence that we're getting from most of our big accounts and our SMB business suggests that, and you will continue to have good pricing power there. And then leisure, I think, again, a little bit like this year, you're going to continue to see normalization. What does that mean? That means, I think demand is sort of flat to maybe even down a little bit. But again, because like in all segments of life, particularly here in the US, inflation is down, but still stubbornly a bit high. I do believe that we'll continue to have very solid pricing power. So when you blend it all out, I think, again, it will look a lot like this year. I think it will, depending on the segment, be balanced, as I just described. But if you blend the whole world together, it will be a nice blend of both demand and pricing the way all that sort of -- all of what I just said amalgamates together. And listen, we spend a lot of time on this. We just did our, as we always do every quarter, our quarterly business review with the whole world. And everybody's in budget season and has got their head down. But I think the overarching sort of atmospherics with our teams around the world is consistent with what I just said, feeling pretty good. I mean, listen, we'd rather have higher RevPAR growth always, but we feel that, that's pretty solid. And the last thing to finish my pillar buster, thank you for the question, Joe, because I'm answering a bunch. We obviously feel really good about unit growth. We have given some guidance there. We've got a lot of momentum in that area. I'm sure we'll have more questions, but we feel very good about that. And so the way I would think about it is we're always trying to deliver algorithm growth, back to your initial question, which is I always say here, X plus Y needs to equal Z. So same store and unit growth need to add up. And I am very confident that algorithm will be alive and well for 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning everyone. Chris, just maybe on the development side, given you just talked a lot about kind of what's going on in the kind of RevPAR and macro side. Can you just walk us through -- obviously, we now have the initial expectation of 6% to 7% for next year, a little bit more about what your kind of underlying assumption is there and sort of how it might factor in, possibilities of like what could -- maybe just walk us through what could be a little bit better if the development environment were to improve? Obviously, your starts remain really compelling, and what could be a little bit worse, just what would be the kind of range or bound of outcomes there? Thank you.\nChristopher Nassetta: I'll offer some comments, and Kevin runs development, so I should see to him, too. I mean I do think we feel, obviously, really good about 6% to 7%. We have more visibility into that than obviously the macro. We have a view on macro that's based, as I described on consensus. But we have good visibility. We've got a lot of stuff under construction. We have a lot of momentum on conversion. So the way I would say it is just a couple of points of clarification. One, the 6% to 7% is organic, that's not sort of incorporating partnerships, which is why this year's number is coming in higher than that at 7% to 7.5%. I would say implied in it is about a third of it would be conversions. That's about where we'll end up this year. By the way, if you take out the partnerships, we'll end up at about a third. If you add the partnerships in, we're about 50%. So -- but we don't, again, expect to repeat that. And that's how we get to it. Again, it's a super granular analysis other than in the year or for the year conversions, everything is identified, meaning it's in the pipeline. It's happening. And so it's really delivering on that one. And if it's going to deliver next year, it's pretty much got to be under construction right now or in the next. There may be a brand or two in a place or two around the world, including the US, where you could still start something, maybe with a LiveSmart right now or in the next 30 days and sneak it in next year, but it gets awfully hard. So in terms of the new build stuff, we have a good sense of that. Again, conversions, we have a good sense of a lot of those, because like Spark and others, they're in the pipeline, so. And then there's a segment of those conversions that are unidentified. We have a really good track record on delivering that. Obviously, those numbers at a third have been moving up. We've done more than that historically, but they've moved up from the low 20s to about a third. And we're taking a very disproportionate share of conversion opportunities around the world, and that's because our brands are performing really, really well, and we don't see any risk of that. So, what could make it like at the higher or lower end of the range, I think sort of intellectually the right way to say it is, maybe it has to be ultimately in the conversion space because of what I just said. I mean, maybe there's a few more that sneak under construction at the end of this year, but I don't think that's going to move the needle a whole heck of a lot. I think it's that we're more than a third in the conversions. I think that's possible. I'm not saying I think that'll happen, but I think that's possible. We give a range of six to seven for a reason that there's still a heck of a lot of work that Kevin and our development teams around the world have to do. I hope we make it look a little bit easy. It's not, but we feel really good about that range. And so, again, intellectually to do, you know, better or worse relative to the midpoint of that range is sort of conversions more or less.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Thanks. I guess maybe a follow-up on the NUG commentary, I guess how does the pipeline of what's in construction just from a fee-per-room mix compared to the existing base? And have you seen any change in the development as rates have started to come down here and lending has loosened?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Thanks, Steve. I'll take the second part first because it's a little bit easier. I think you are starting to see things free up a little bit in terms of the development environment as rates haven't come dramatically down, but they've come down a little bit. And I think people can see a path to a better day on the capital front. And we are actually starting to -- there's a lot more conversations around change of ownerships, which I think supports what Chris was just saying about conversions, because you've had -- as is normal for this part of the cycle, you've had pretty widespread between bid and ask on transactions, and transactions drive, as you know, a lot of conversions. And so we're starting to I think, see a little bit of a thawing in bid-ask spreads, which has led to more applications in the last 30 days or so on change of ownerships and things like that. We're starting to see a lot of -- more activity there, which bodes well. And then your first part, the fees per room, we're really not seeing any change. I mean, if you think about the complexion of what we're putting under construction and what we're delivering, it is still largely on an overall basis the same mix. So, we're not seeing dramatic changes in the mix. You're obviously seeing RevPAR growth over time. You're seeing mark-to-market on fees as contracts roll over. We continue to take price in terms of license fees a little bit, and the vast majority of our development actually is in the brand where we get the highest fees. And so when you put all that in the model, we're really not seeing a change in fees per room. And in fact, it will grow over time.\nStephen Grambling: Awesome. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: Sure.\nOperator: And the next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hi, Chris, just building on your point that you think kind of 2025 looks a lot like 2024. I would assume kind of RevPAR being the primary driver of that. Given the group pace that you guys currently have, and I believe you said low double-digits to low teens for 2025 and 2016 -- or sorry, 2025 and 2026. How do we interpret kind of the way you're thinking about leisure and business transient as we move into 2025 based on kind of what we know today?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, I would say and tried to cover it, but I'll click a little harder on it. In group, I think you're going to see a very balance -- you're going to see the highest growth rate. I mean I don't have the number -- I mean, we don't have a budget yet. But you see comparable growth. I mean, you heard the numbers we're talking about for like third quarter, up 5% or 6%. And I think you're going to be looking at that kind of level of growth in the group segment, if you look at the whole world. And I think that will be pretty balanced, as I said, between price and occupancy between rate and occupancy. I think in leisure, again, if you're solving for something in the 2s and that's at 5, I think this is transient ends up being sort of more in that range, again, with a balance, but if group is in the mid-single-digits, I think I think business transient is in the low single-digits, but higher than one. I mean, similar to this year, we're sort of trending at 2, low 2s, something like that. And then I think leisure, which again is, I think I said this, maybe I didn't, it's still trading way over historical levels. We don't think we'll go backwards. We don't think we're going backwards this year, but we think it's sort of flat. And so I would say my expectation, and I already said this, would be demand is flat, maybe even a little bit down as you continue to normalize the work environment and the like. But because you have pretty good pricing power and you still have inflationary pressures, particularly here, but in a lot of parts of the world, we feel like we'll be able to push rate a little bit. And so I would say we think leisure again, it's early, right? I don't have a budget in front of me, but we've talked a lot about it. I think leisure is positive, but not much positive. So I would say it's like very, very modestly positive. And when you put those three things together, that's really not that far off of sort of where we're ending up this year. I mean, I think that's why I say, I think when you finish 2025, at least sitting here today, it feels an awful lot like 2024.\nCarlo Santarelli: I appreciate that Chris. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from David Katz from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, you mentioned earlier that you're getting an outsized and it's obvious amount of conversions. Can you provide just a little bit of insight on how you're doing that? Is that just good old-fashioned shoe leather, any competition or whatever other euphemism? Or are there some specific drivers because we are obviously observing key money more carefully across the industry than usual, et cetera?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, I mean, listen, Kevin may want to come over the top on this because he and his team are doing the shoe leather. I do think it's partly shoe leather. I mean, listen, I think we're -- say to our teams all the time, like our philosophy and how we run a company is we're pretty scrappy. We're pretty gritty. We don't take anything for granted. So we get our hustle. So, our teams hustle. I don't know what everybody else is doing, but we're hustling. We've built really good relationships. So a lot of this business, not all of it, particularly in Spark because they're bringing a bunch of new folks into the system, which are going to be hugely beneficial over time as we saw with Hampton decades ago. But we have really solid relationships where we've done a really good job with people and doing what they ultimately are looking for which leads to what I think is really driving it, which is performance. I mean you're signing up to these deals and not to be pedantic. But these are at the short end, generally very short end, 10. But more likely, these are 20-plus-year relationships that you're entering into with no real way out. And so these people are investing billions of dollars when you aggregate all of this development, even all the conversions, and they want to have confidence that when they're signing up, they're going to make money, but they're signing up for a long time that they've got the right system that they're signing up for. And so the truth is our track record is really good. Our brands are performing really well. Our market share is the highest it's ever been. It's significantly higher than any of our competitors. And so that doesn't mean we don't have to compete. I say the same all the time. For this cool like, why don't we win every deal? Why should we -- why are we only winning half the deals even though we're, whatever, 6% of the global market. I'll let Kevin explain himself on that. But getting half the business is pretty darn good. And I think it ultimately comes down to our ability over a long period of time to be able to deliver performance for owners because we can be witty, charming, scrappy gritty, we can be all the things we think we are or hope to be. But in the end, it's about performance. They're investing money in these assets or -- and this relationship with us to drive returns.\nOperator: The next question will be from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. Chris, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how your visibility on business transient and leisure transient kind of compares to what it would have been in 2019? In other words, do you feel like you have more visibility or less visibility today? And then if I could squeeze 1 in for Kevin just on the comments about what drove better EBITDA than guide. I would love to hear about the non-RevPAR fees. And then also I think there was a timing benefit there as well. Thanks.\nChristopher Nassetta: Thanks Robin. I would say the answer is we don't have a tremendous amount of incremental visibility. The place we obviously have the most visibility is in group, which is why we give you those statistics. That business is pretty darn sticky. We have found recently and over a long span of time, people have needs, they still have pent-up needs. So, we feel really good about that. But leisure and transient, I mean, leisure transient, transient, business our visibility is limited, certainly limited to 60 or 90 days out. But then anecdotally, particularly with business transient, just talking to all of our customers, which we do all the time, our sales teams, I do, others in senior management to. We survey them. We do have data that tells us what they're thinking, and that gives us a rationale for what I'm saying to you I think will happen next year. But they haven't booked the business yet. Unlike groups where they booked it, they haven't booked it and then leisure where we have the least visibility into the future. Now, the reason I started my whole answer in my filibuster with the consensus view was obviously not lost on you or anybody else, particularly in leisure and business transient as it relates to how we think about next year, a lot of it so goes the economy to a degree, so goes those segments. So, that's why it always has to start with a view, a consensus view of like what the heck do we think is going to happen in the economy. It's not that the group business is immune to it. It's just stickier. It just -- it is not as immune to short-term swings overtime as the other segments. So, that's -- it's about -- I mean, have we gotten better, do we have better listening posts with our customers than we might have had five years ago? Yes, I think so. I think we're better at understanding what's going on. The reality in terms of booking visibility is about the same.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. And then on the -- Robin, on the non-RevPAR German fees, we were -- clearly, we were pleased with the performance. If RevPAR came in for all the reasons talked about under our expectations, the non-RevPAR-driven fees -- if you think about performance in the credit card business, in our purchasing business, things like that was all sort of above algorithm, if you will, above the overall rate of the business. And then on timing, it was about half the beat from the third quarter were timing items if you get behind it, and so that's about all I'd say about that.\nRobin Farley: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask,\nChristopher Nassetta: Good morning, Semdes.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Good morning. You talked a lot about just group going into next year, and it has been and continues to be. It looks like kind of a silver lining in the space. And I was just wondering when you look at what you're seeing now for 2025 group, I guess, particularly in the U.S., is there -- is it driven more by incremental citywide conventions? Is it more smaller groups that I think have been doing well for a while? Is there anything just kind of in particular that you could call out that's helping to drive that continued strength there?\nChristopher Nassetta: I'd say it's a little bit of everything. If you think about what's going on, certainly, the big city-wides are picking up and not surprisingly. They just -- we've been saying this on every call. This takes longer in gestation to get those -- that business going because they book multiple years in advance. They spend millions of dollars planning these events. And they went for two or three years unwilling and/or unable to do that. And so we're certainly seeing wind in our sales from that. But we're also seeing really good social group business. I mean people still want to get out and see people. I mean, that is still a thing. And then I'd say corporate meetings are -- we're seeing really terrific demand. I mean even though the workplace is sort of normalizing somewhat, it is not going back to where was. And the reality is a lot of people have needs and that they're making -- sort of up for a time when they were more remote. They needed meetings for innovation and culture building and the like. And a lot of people have sort of changed pretty permanently, us included. By the way, our work environment a way where we take less space because people are more mobile, and it requires them needing space outside of their own office footprint more than historically they have. And so, that's a nice little wind in our sail as well. So that's a long-winded way of saying it's broad-based. I mean there's -- it's not one thing driving it.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Lizzie Dove from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nLizzie Dove: Hi there. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to go back to the unit growth piece, which is obviously very strong. I believe the majority of the pipeline is coming from international just about. So, a little bit of a refresh of just where you see the key opportunities, the key markets driving that international expansion, maybe a refresh on the China piece as well with the stimulus. And just in any way that you kind of have to adapt your portfolio as you take those brands to different markets?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, I mean, I guess the end, Lizzie, thanks for the question, is the easy part is, yes, you do have to adapt your brands and your prototypes and your room sizes and things like that, the markets around the world. They still maintain their essence and their positioning within the brand ladder and their swim wins and things like that, but you're obviously adapting them around the world. I think that sort of if you think about the complexity of the pipeline, it's about -- it's a little over half, call it, 55-or-so percent outside the US. The stuff that's under construction, just given the dynamics of some of the things that are going on around the world, our limited service business in China, things like that, it's about 80% of what's under construction is outside the US. Deliveries this year are going to be sort of more like the pipeline sort of think about it as mid-40s percent in the U.S. and 55% or so percent outside the U.S. I think the China business is doing great. We think both approval starts. I'm jumping around a little bit. But sorry, it was a broad question. Our approval starts and opens we think will all be up in China this year. We're -- even though there's a macro slowdown in China and you read a lot of headlines about real estate bubbles and the like in China. What's going on a lot in China is they're trying to find different uses for some of these buildings and some of the real estate that's been developed. And our business, particularly the limited service part of our business, both in our Master Limited partnerships and in our Hilton Garden Inn business is able to take advantage of a lot of the adaptive reuse of those businesses -- of those pieces of real estate. So -- and I think when you take a step back from it, though, I know you're relatively new to the coverage. But you've gone through the materials. And we outlined in our Investor Day, is kind of over the time period that we gave you for that. We think, call it, half of the NUG, 3 to 3.5 points will be in the Americas, 1-point or so will be in EMEA and 2 points will be in APAC. And that will move around a little bit year-to-year. But generally speaking, those will be the trends. And then you'll see in the Western world more conversions. In the developed world, more new builds. In Asia, we're shifting our business to APAC outside of China. So a lot of growth opportunities there, a lot of growth opportunities in India, a lot of growth opportunities in the Middle East. So, we're really seeing the benefit of a diversified set of products that we can deploy. And when certain parts of the world are strong, we can deploy in those parts of the world when certain parts slow down, diversification is a beautiful thing, and we're continuing to grow through it.\nLizzie Dove: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandt Montour: Good morning, everybody. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I'm curious on SLH. I know it's relatively new, but that's a big chunk of luxury hotels in your system on the website. People can earn and burn their points there. Curious how the early traction has been, if you've done anything sort of out of the norm in terms of marketing those hotels to loyalty members and how you're feeling about the start there.\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, I mean you're right, Brandt, it is super early, but in the sense that they just went in and sort of the middle end of the summer. And a lot of those properties are resorts in very unique locations that book way ahead of time. So, there's only so much data we have just given the time of year it came in. But the data that we do have is super good, meaning that our customers are engaging with it. They're looking at the availability of these properties. Now many of them this summer weren't available because they had already been booked given when they came in the system. They are -- where they did utilize it, they utilized it in a very healthy way for redemptions, which is exactly sort of the behavior set that we're looking for. And so I'd say obviously, a long way to go, but we feel very good about the ownership community and SLH feels very good about the start of the relationship. And I think as we get into the -- get a little bit of time, quarter or two and then certainly get into the spring and summer of next year, I think you'll see some real uptick. But you go in like if you go on our app, I had to do it. I was in Italy and Tuscany to meet some friends, where we have a few hotels go in the app and like hotels nearby me. And we went from having like three hotels to 40 hotels. So, -- and many of them are really small and very unique, but that's exactly what for a leisure, high-end leisure customer they're looking for. And so it really gives us significant enhancement in terms of shots on goal for people to book and importantly, for people to be able to dream that are road warriors and have a place to realize those dreams.\nBrandt Montour: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Michael Bellisario from Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning.\nChristopher Nassetta: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Bellisario: Chris, you sort of alluded to it, but just wanted to dig into RevPAR index and pipeline share a little bit more. Is it fair to assume that in a slower RevPAR backdrop that's maybe actually better for your business, at least on a relative basis? And then any similarities or differences that you see today compared to 2018 and 2019 when RevPAR was last in kind of stuck in first year? Thanks.\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, I mean it's interesting. I said earlier, so I don't want to contradict myself that obviously always like to see RevPAR higher. And so I will say it again, I'd always like to see it higher. But having said that, there are, and then you alluded to it in the approach to the question, there are benefits of the environment we're in. And we saw those benefits going back to that time where typically, we are able to deliver. If we do our jobs, better share in terms of performance on our existing assets. And we take in more difficult environments, environments where financing is less available, we end up disproportionately getting more conversions and more of what is available for new construction because our brands are just more financeable. And so that is certainly what we've been experiencing. If you look at the numbers across the board on development, whether you break it apart on new construction or conversions, you look at market share numbers, which continue, I mean, they're very high. So getting them -- they continue to grow. We've grown market share every single year in the eight, almost going on 18 years I've been here. So the higher you go, the harder it gets, but we're super focused on that. So I'm not giving you a specific answer because there isn't one, but this environment is not terrible for us in that way. And the really nice thing, as I think we demonstrated in the third quarter and we'll demonstrate for the full year, and I think we'll demonstrate again next year and the year after is the model is really resilient that even, I mean, think about it, even in the environment we're in where we're going to be in the twos on same store growth, we're going to deliver a circuit 10% EBITDA growth and higher than that in EPS and free cash flow. That doesn't -- I mean, that doesn't feel so bad. Imagine what can be done in an even better environment from a same store point of view. So that's not -- as I said, I know I'm not answering it specifically. But these conditions are -- we feel like whatever -- I guess I'd finalize it by saying we can't determine the macro. What we can do always is outperform competition. And so we feel good about in this environment, our ability to do that. We feel good about that. And our job is in every environment to do that, but we -- yes, and we will, but we feel we -- we're not -- this is not a terrible environment in terms of our ability to deliver.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Meredith Jensen from HSBC. Please go ahead.\nMeredith Jensen: Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the occupancy and rate sort of offset. I know in the past you've spoken quite a bit about pushing rate. And I'm wondering how that conversation with franchisees and hotels have gone, shifted over the past few months? Thank you.\nChristopher Nassetta: It hasn't really shifted. I mean, obviously inflation is down broadly, use the US because it's our biggest market and we're here, sitting here in the US. And inflation is not running 8% to 10%, but it's still running four plus against the target of two, which I think personally will be a long time coming just because of the underlying strength in the broader economy. And one thing we didn't talk about yet is the basic fiscal spending between shifts and inflation reduction and infrastructure. You put all that stuff together, forget the private sector, there's a huge amount of public sector spending going on. And I think all of that sort of underpins growth and non-residential fixed investment, which drives a lot of demand in our business, which I think continues to give us a decent amount of rate integrity. And so our expectation is while that isn't -- is moderating from the hypercharge levels that you saw generally of inflation across a lot of sectors and we expect the same thing in ours, we still expect that there's a decent amount of pricing pressure. And so as we think about, by the way, we have very sophisticated revenue management models that it's not Christmas with its hand on the button deciding the rate of every room every night, thankfully. But we have very sophisticated systems. But those systems and all of our data scientists here at Hilton still believe that given those conditions in most segments at most times, there is good pricing integrity. The one area that I talked about where probably less by nature, if you think demand might be flat or going down a little bit as leisure normalizes, particularly on weekends, there may be a little bit less pressure there. But broadly, as I said, Mike, I think when we finish this year and next, I think leisure rates will be up. Not a lot, but I think leisure rates will be up just because of the underlying macro conditions. I don't know if that answered it, but the short answer is not nothing material that we see that's different in the last few months, certainly.\nMeredith Jensen: Super helpful. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question is from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one, continuing on development, the guide for key money or contract acquisition costs at the beginning of the year, $250 million to $300 million, and that came down this quarter. Obviously, we only have two months left in the year, so you have a good sense of where things are from a key money standpoint. Kevin, I know this is something you guys highlighted at the Investor Day. But is this more of just a delay to 2025? Or is this just more progress in your goal to reduce key money as a percentage of NUG? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. I mean, look, I think key money terms of percentage NUG and the more strategic bid, no change in our approach. I mean we still use key money on less than 10% of our deals. We use them when we have to when it gets competitive, but 90%-plus of the deals don't anything associated with them. It's just a little bit of timing, right? We're getting closer to the end of the year. We have more visibility into what we think is going to happen. A little bit of a couple of projects that we have in the works that we think are more likely to happen next year. And if you think about last year, was a bit heavier year because of some strategic projects. This year, it will be a little bit lighter. I think going forward, if you think about next year, probably somewhere in between last year and this year, but really no change in strategy.\nChad Beynon: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nChristopher Nassetta: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: Morning. Kevin, a question for you. What are your ROI targets for brands, specifically developing them internally versus buying a brand? And then related to that, on these recent, I'd call them tuck-in brand acquisitions, are these initially accretive to earnings? Or if not, how long does it take for them to be accretive? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: No, I think, look, there's a lot there, Patrick, or we've talked about this a lot. I think when you think about, we haven't done a lot of acquisitions. So if you think about broadly alluded to sort of buy versus build. Obviously, the ROI is near infinite when we build these brands and build them over time organically into multibillion-dollar businesses. It's sort of you do a buy versus build analysis, but it almost always suggests build from a pure ROI perspective. And the last couple of deals we've done, they've been basically accretive out of the box, right? I think we -- we didn't -- we disclosed that on Graduate, if you'll recall from the press release that it's accretive out of the box. So, on both of these things, they were very specific to things we wanted to tuck in strategically. We're able to take advantage of a little bit of a distress in the environment to buy them really well and they were accretive right away, as I said.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you.\\\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Chad, thanks. And to everybody that joined, thank you for the time. Obviously, a lot going on in the world. But we're really happy with how the third quarter worked out. We feel good about the fourth and the full year. And as we've talked about quite a bit today, I feel good about the setup for 2025. We look forward to catching up with you after the years out and be a little bit more specific on 2025 at that point. And I hope everybody has a good end of the year and great holiday season when you get to it. It's funny to hear myself say that, but it's that time of year. Anyway, thanks again for the time today.\nOperator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Jacobs",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 1.4% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by strong international performance and continued recovery in group. Adjusted EBITDA was $904 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected non-RevPAR fee growth, lower corporate expense and some timing items. Management franchise fees grew 8% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.92. Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR was up 1%, driven by a strong group performance. In the Americas outside of the US, third quarter RevPAR increased 4% year-over-year, driven by strong results in urban markets, particularly in Mexico. In Europe, RevPAR grew 7% year-over-year driven by key summer events, including the Olympics in France and the European soccer championships in Germany. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 3% year-over-year, led by occupancy gains in Qatar and Riyadh. In the Asia-Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR was down 3% year-over-year. RevPAR in APAC ex-China increased 4%, led by strong performance in India. However, China RevPAR declined 9% in the quarter with difficult year-over-year domestic travel comparisons, disruptions due to typhoons and limited international inbound travel negatively affecting results. Turning to development. We ended the quarter with approximately 492,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 8% year-over-year with approximately 60% of those rooms located outside of the US and nearly half under construction. For the full year, we expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5%. Moving to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 2% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $804 million and $834 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.57 and $1.67. For full year 2024, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 2.5%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.375 billion and $3.405 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.93 and $7.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $37 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $2.4 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And for the full year, we expect to return approximately $3 billion. Further details on our third quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please. Yes. Thanks, Steve. I'll take the second part first because it's a little bit easier. I think you are starting to see things free up a little bit in terms of the development environment as rates haven't come dramatically down, but they've come down a little bit. And I think people can see a path to a better day on the capital front. And we are actually starting to -- there's a lot more conversations around change of ownerships, which I think supports what Chris was just saying about conversions, because you've had -- as is normal for this part of the cycle, you've had pretty widespread between bid and ask on transactions, and transactions drive, as you know, a lot of conversions. And so we're starting to I think, see a little bit of a thawing in bid-ask spreads, which has led to more applications in the last 30 days or so on change of ownerships and things like that. We're starting to see a lot of -- more activity there, which bodes well. And then your first part, the fees per room, we're really not seeing any change. I mean, if you think about the complexion of what we're putting under construction and what we're delivering, it is still largely on an overall basis the same mix. So, we're not seeing dramatic changes in the mix. You're obviously seeing RevPAR growth over time. You're seeing mark-to-market on fees as contracts roll over. We continue to take price in terms of license fees a little bit, and the vast majority of our development actually is in the brand where we get the highest fees. And so when you put all that in the model, we're really not seeing a change in fees per room. And in fact, it will grow over time. Sure. Yes. And then on the -- Robin, on the non-RevPAR German fees, we were -- clearly, we were pleased with the performance. If RevPAR came in for all the reasons talked about under our expectations, the non-RevPAR-driven fees -- if you think about performance in the credit card business, in our purchasing business, things like that was all sort of above algorithm, if you will, above the overall rate of the business. And then on timing, it was about half the beat from the third quarter were timing items if you get behind it, and so that's about all I'd say about that. Yes, I mean, I guess the end, Lizzie, thanks for the question, is the easy part is, yes, you do have to adapt your brands and your prototypes and your room sizes and things like that, the markets around the world. They still maintain their essence and their positioning within the brand ladder and their swim wins and things like that, but you're obviously adapting them around the world. I think that sort of if you think about the complexity of the pipeline, it's about -- it's a little over half, call it, 55-or-so percent outside the US. The stuff that's under construction, just given the dynamics of some of the things that are going on around the world, our limited service business in China, things like that, it's about 80% of what's under construction is outside the US. Deliveries this year are going to be sort of more like the pipeline sort of think about it as mid-40s percent in the U.S. and 55% or so percent outside the U.S. I think the China business is doing great. We think both approval starts. I'm jumping around a little bit. But sorry, it was a broad question. Our approval starts and opens we think will all be up in China this year. We're -- even though there's a macro slowdown in China and you read a lot of headlines about real estate bubbles and the like in China. What's going on a lot in China is they're trying to find different uses for some of these buildings and some of the real estate that's been developed. And our business, particularly the limited service part of our business, both in our Master Limited partnerships and in our Hilton Garden Inn business is able to take advantage of a lot of the adaptive reuse of those businesses -- of those pieces of real estate. So -- and I think when you take a step back from it, though, I know you're relatively new to the coverage. But you've gone through the materials. And we outlined in our Investor Day, is kind of over the time period that we gave you for that. We think, call it, half of the NUG, 3 to 3.5 points will be in the Americas, 1-point or so will be in EMEA and 2 points will be in APAC. And that will move around a little bit year-to-year. But generally speaking, those will be the trends. And then you'll see in the Western world more conversions. In the developed world, more new builds. In Asia, we're shifting our business to APAC outside of China. So a lot of growth opportunities there, a lot of growth opportunities in India, a lot of growth opportunities in the Middle East. So, we're really seeing the benefit of a diversified set of products that we can deploy. And when certain parts of the world are strong, we can deploy in those parts of the world when certain parts slow down, diversification is a beautiful thing, and we're continuing to grow through it. Yes, sure. I mean, look, I think key money terms of percentage NUG and the more strategic bid, no change in our approach. I mean we still use key money on less than 10% of our deals. We use them when we have to when it gets competitive, but 90%-plus of the deals don't anything associated with them. It's just a little bit of timing, right? We're getting closer to the end of the year. We have more visibility into what we think is going to happen. A little bit of a couple of projects that we have in the works that we think are more likely to happen next year. And if you think about last year, was a bit heavier year because of some strategic projects. This year, it will be a little bit lighter. I think going forward, if you think about next year, probably somewhere in between last year and this year, but really no change in strategy. No, I think, look, there's a lot there, Patrick, or we've talked about this a lot. I think when you think about, we haven't done a lot of acquisitions. So if you think about broadly alluded to sort of buy versus build. Obviously, the ROI is near infinite when we build these brands and build them over time organically into multibillion-dollar businesses. It's sort of you do a buy versus build analysis, but it almost always suggests build from a pure ROI perspective. And the last couple of deals we've done, they've been basically accretive out of the box, right? I think we -- we didn't -- we disclosed that on Graduate, if you'll recall from the press release that it's accretive out of the box. So, on both of these things, they were very specific to things we wanted to tuck in strategically. We're able to take advantage of a little bit of a distress in the environment to buy them really well and they were accretive right away, as I said."

            "name": "Christopher Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you. Jill. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. Our third quarter results continued to demonstrate the strength of our business model as strong net unit growth helped drive solid bottom line performance. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS both exceeded the high end of our guidance, despite softer-than-expected RevPAR performance. We opened more hotel rooms than any other quarter in the history of our company and surpassed 8,000 hotels in our system. We also reached a milestone 200 million Hilton Honors members in the quarter, as our award-winning program, industry-leading brands and exceptional service continued to increase guest loyalty. Turning to results. Third quarter system-wide RevPAR increased 1.4% year-over-year, below our guidance range due to slower ramp in September following Labor Day, weather impacts, unfavorable calendar shifts and ongoing labor disputes in the US. Business transient RevPAR increased 2% with growth across both large corporates and small and medium-sized businesses. Leisure trends continue to normalize with RevPAR declining modestly from post-pandemic peaks. Group RevPAR was more than 5% year-over-year, led by strong demand for both corporate and social meetings and events. For the full year, group position is up 10% with group position in 2025 and 2026, up low double-digits to mid-teens. Adjusting for holiday and calendar shifts, we estimate systemwide RevPAR grew at 2.3% in the quarter, just slightly softer than the second quarter and with all segments increasing. On an adjusted basis, leisure transient RevPAR increased nearly 2%, driven largely by solid trends across Continental Europe. In the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR growth largely in line with third quarter, driven by strong group bookings, continued business transient recovery and favorable calendar shifts, partially offset by the election and ongoing labor disputes in the U.S. Weekday pace for October is tracking up more than 300 basis points versus September's weekday pace, driven by solid business transient performance and group strength. Company meetings and convention business continue to grow as a percentage of mix driving longer booking windows. Given year-to-date performance and fourth quarter expectations, we expect forecast full year RevPAR growth of 2%, 2.5%, and full year adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 10%, demonstrating the continued resiliency of our business model. Turning to development in the quarter. We opened a record 531 hotels, totaling more than 36,000 rooms, and achieved the highest net unit growth in our history at 7.8%. We marked several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 8,000th hotel worldwide, our 900th hotel in Asia-Pacific and our 900th hotel in EMEA. Home2 Suites, which has more than doubled in supply in the last five years, opened its 700th hotel and continues to have the largest new development pipeline in the industry. We continue to expand our lifestyle portfolio, opening a number of new hotels in the quarter, including the Graduate Auburn and Graduate Princeton, the first two openings under our newly acquired Graduate brand. We also introduced several brands in new markets around the world, including Spark in Canada, Embassy Suites in UAE, Canopy in Japan and Hampton in Switzerland, demonstrating the strong value of our industry-leading brands and delivering for owners. We welcome nearly 400 luxury properties through our exclusive agreement with Small Luxury Hotels of the World. These properties, spanning 70 different countries, provide Honors members even more opportunities to book unique luxury experiences and sought-after destinations across the globe. Including SLH and our existing luxury properties, we now have one of the largest luxury hotel portfolios in the industry. Conversions accounted for 60% of openings in the quarter, driven by the addition of SLH properties and continued momentum from Spark. We opened more than 20 Spark hotels in the quarter and now have over 6,000 Spark rooms in supply just a year after the brand opened its first property. Spark now has opened hotels in the US and the UK and Canada, and we recently announced plans to open hotels in Germany and Austria before the end of the year. The brand's pipeline is three times larger than its existing supply, and we expect continued launches in international markets to further boost Spark's trajectory, positioning us well for future growth in the premium economy space. In the quarter, we signed 28,000 rooms, expanding our pipeline to more than 492,000 rooms, which is up 8% year-over-year, excluding partnerships, our pipeline also increased from the second quarter. We signed three luxury deals in Greece, Japan and the UAE and 35 lifestyle properties, including a record 15 Curios. Conversions accounted for more than 30% of signings in the quarter, driven by the strength of Spark and continued momentum across Curio, Tapestry and DoubleTree. Construction starts remained strong, up 21%, excluding acquisitions and partnerships. We remain on track to exceed prior levels of starts by year-end with meaningful growth across both the US and international markets. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction, and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more 20% of industry share and nearly four times our existing share of supply. As a result of our strong pipeline and under construction activity, we continue to expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5% for the full year and 6% to 7% for 2025. We continue to be recognized for our culture and award-winning brands. During the quarter, we were named the top hospitality workplace in Latin America and Asia by Great Place to Work, adding to the more than 560 Great Place to Work Awards and nearly 60 number one wins around the world since 2016. We're also proudly named the number two workplace on the 2024 People Magazine Companies That Care list and recently recognizes Time's Best Hotel Brand of 2024. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the milestones we've achieved, our full network of brands to continue to be an engine of opportunity for our guests, our owners and our team members, we're excited about our growth into future. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results for the quarter and our expectations for the full year. Yes, that's a good question. Obviously, it's a tad early to be getting into 2025 guidance, as you know, we would typically do that at the end of -- when we report year end at the beginning of next year. But I will give you a high-level sense of it. I mean we are in the sort of early-ish stages of budget season, so lots of work to do. But I would say I have a reasonably -- like most things, I have a reasonably strong view of where I think things will end up. And so I'd start with sort of like how do we feel broadly about 2025 and I would say we feel pretty good about it. I've been doing this for longer than I'm going to admit, maybe close to 40 years. I've rarely seen sort of a stronger consensus view on the macro, particularly here in the U.S. But I think broadly -- and that macro view is sort of, I think, the word resiliency I used to describe our business. I think that word is getting used a lot to describe the economy. And I think there is a very broad consensus view that the economy will continue to be -- it obviously has been slowing because that's what the Fed has been trying to do here in the U.S. and to a degree, in other parts of the world, but focus on the U.S. But it remains strong, resilient, and showing positive growth. And I think our -- the consensus for you is that next year will be more of that, that we'll have positive economic growth. The odds of a recession at this point, I think, are quite low. If you look again at consensus view, I'm not an economist, but that's the view. And I talk to a lot of people, and I would generally agree with the view. So, I think as we think about as a backdrop, thinking about 2025, what's going to be the macro, which can drive a bunch of our business, obviously. We feel pretty good about it. I think when you think about how that's going to add up, and I'll sort of give you the punch line and then I'll break it down a little bit by regions and segments. I mean I think the punchline is my best sense, again, early in our budget season, is that next year is going to look a lot like this year from a same-store growth point of view. Now I think we'll get there a little bit differently. But I would say at this point, I think next year, we'll end up when we're sitting here a year from now, we'll be saying it felt a lot like 2024. If you break that down regionally, I think it's -- again, at a high level, where I think it ends up is the US ends up pretty similar to what we're experiencing this year. I think if you look at Asia-Pacific, I think it will be better in in part because comps China are going to get easier and there's a lot of stimulus occurring there. So I do think China will have a better year. And China -- I mean, APAC ex China remains quite strong, as Kevin suggested in his comments. And we don't see a lot that's going to disrupt that. And we have some comp benefits, particularly in the third quarter in weather in in typhoons Japan and China that will be a benefit. So, I think APAC will be better. I think EMEA will be a little bit less good than it's been. I think it's still going to be very good, to be clear. My guess is that it will probably still lead the pack in RevPAR growth in terms of our mega regions around the world. So it's not that I see a problem there. But I do think it will be somewhat less growth than we saw this year. And when you blend it all together, US about the same. APAC a little bit better. EMEA may be a little bit worse. I think you end up kind of about where you are. If you break it down by segments, again, I mean I'm homogenizing a lot of stuff together. But I think it's again a similar story, maybe with a little bit of nuance. I think on the group side, you're going to continue to see really good strength. I said we're up in the low to mid-teens in terms of our position going into next year, so we feel really good we'll cross over with more than half the business on the books. And booking windows are extending because there's just not enough supply relative to the demand. So I think you're going to see both demand growth and pricing growth in the group segment. I think in business transient, which will be, I think, in in second place terms of the pecking order of growth. Again, broadly, I think you're going to continue to see business transient grind up. I do think next year, we will likely surpass prior peaks of 2019 in terms of demand levels. So you will see increase in demand. All the anecdotal and hard evidence that we're getting from most of our big accounts and our SMB business suggests that, and you will continue to have good pricing power there. And then leisure, I think, again, a little bit like this year, you're going to continue to see normalization. What does that mean? That means, I think demand is sort of flat to maybe even down a little bit. But again, because like in all segments of life, particularly here in the US, inflation is down, but still stubbornly a bit high. I do believe that we'll continue to have very solid pricing power. So when you blend it all out, I think, again, it will look a lot like this year. I think it will, depending on the segment, be balanced, as I just described. But if you blend the whole world together, it will be a nice blend of both demand and pricing the way all that sort of -- all of what I just said amalgamates together. And listen, we spend a lot of time on this. We just did our, as we always do every quarter, our quarterly business review with the whole world. And everybody's in budget season and has got their head down. But I think the overarching sort of atmospherics with our teams around the world is consistent with what I just said, feeling pretty good. I mean, listen, we'd rather have higher RevPAR growth always, but we feel that, that's pretty solid. And the last thing to finish my pillar buster, thank you for the question, Joe, because I'm answering a bunch. We obviously feel really good about unit growth. We have given some guidance there. We've got a lot of momentum in that area. I'm sure we'll have more questions, but we feel very good about that. And so the way I would think about it is we're always trying to deliver algorithm growth, back to your initial question, which is I always say here, X plus Y needs to equal Z. So same store and unit growth need to add up. And I am very confident that algorithm will be alive and well for 2025. I'll offer some comments, and Kevin runs development, so I should see to him, too. I mean I do think we feel, obviously, really good about 6% to 7%. We have more visibility into that than obviously the macro. We have a view on macro that's based, as I described on consensus. But we have good visibility. We've got a lot of stuff under construction. We have a lot of momentum on conversion. So the way I would say it is just a couple of points of clarification. One, the 6% to 7% is organic, that's not sort of incorporating partnerships, which is why this year's number is coming in higher than that at 7% to 7.5%. I would say implied in it is about a third of it would be conversions. That's about where we'll end up this year. By the way, if you take out the partnerships, we'll end up at about a third. If you add the partnerships in, we're about 50%. So -- but we don't, again, expect to repeat that. And that's how we get to it. Again, it's a super granular analysis other than in the year or for the year conversions, everything is identified, meaning it's in the pipeline. It's happening. And so it's really delivering on that one. And if it's going to deliver next year, it's pretty much got to be under construction right now or in the next. There may be a brand or two in a place or two around the world, including the US, where you could still start something, maybe with a LiveSmart right now or in the next 30 days and sneak it in next year, but it gets awfully hard. So in terms of the new build stuff, we have a good sense of that. Again, conversions, we have a good sense of a lot of those, because like Spark and others, they're in the pipeline, so. And then there's a segment of those conversions that are unidentified. We have a really good track record on delivering that. Obviously, those numbers at a third have been moving up. We've done more than that historically, but they've moved up from the low 20s to about a third. And we're taking a very disproportionate share of conversion opportunities around the world, and that's because our brands are performing really, really well, and we don't see any risk of that. So, what could make it like at the higher or lower end of the range, I think sort of intellectually the right way to say it is, maybe it has to be ultimately in the conversion space because of what I just said. I mean, maybe there's a few more that sneak under construction at the end of this year, but I don't think that's going to move the needle a whole heck of a lot. I think it's that we're more than a third in the conversions. I think that's possible. I'm not saying I think that'll happen, but I think that's possible. We give a range of six to seven for a reason that there's still a heck of a lot of work that Kevin and our development teams around the world have to do. I hope we make it look a little bit easy. It's not, but we feel really good about that range. And so, again, intellectually to do, you know, better or worse relative to the midpoint of that range is sort of conversions more or less. Yes, I would say and tried to cover it, but I'll click a little harder on it. In group, I think you're going to see a very balance -- you're going to see the highest growth rate. I mean I don't have the number -- I mean, we don't have a budget yet. But you see comparable growth. I mean, you heard the numbers we're talking about for like third quarter, up 5% or 6%. And I think you're going to be looking at that kind of level of growth in the group segment, if you look at the whole world. And I think that will be pretty balanced, as I said, between price and occupancy between rate and occupancy. I think in leisure, again, if you're solving for something in the 2s and that's at 5, I think this is transient ends up being sort of more in that range, again, with a balance, but if group is in the mid-single-digits, I think I think business transient is in the low single-digits, but higher than one. I mean, similar to this year, we're sort of trending at 2, low 2s, something like that. And then I think leisure, which again is, I think I said this, maybe I didn't, it's still trading way over historical levels. We don't think we'll go backwards. We don't think we're going backwards this year, but we think it's sort of flat. And so I would say my expectation, and I already said this, would be demand is flat, maybe even a little bit down as you continue to normalize the work environment and the like. But because you have pretty good pricing power and you still have inflationary pressures, particularly here, but in a lot of parts of the world, we feel like we'll be able to push rate a little bit. And so I would say we think leisure again, it's early, right? I don't have a budget in front of me, but we've talked a lot about it. I think leisure is positive, but not much positive. So I would say it's like very, very modestly positive. And when you put those three things together, that's really not that far off of sort of where we're ending up this year. I mean, I think that's why I say, I think when you finish 2025, at least sitting here today, it feels an awful lot like 2024. Yes, I mean, listen, Kevin may want to come over the top on this because he and his team are doing the shoe leather. I do think it's partly shoe leather. I mean, listen, I think we're -- say to our teams all the time, like our philosophy and how we run a company is we're pretty scrappy. We're pretty gritty. We don't take anything for granted. So we get our hustle. So, our teams hustle. I don't know what everybody else is doing, but we're hustling. We've built really good relationships. So a lot of this business, not all of it, particularly in Spark because they're bringing a bunch of new folks into the system, which are going to be hugely beneficial over time as we saw with Hampton decades ago. But we have really solid relationships where we've done a really good job with people and doing what they ultimately are looking for which leads to what I think is really driving it, which is performance. I mean you're signing up to these deals and not to be pedantic. But these are at the short end, generally very short end, 10. But more likely, these are 20-plus-year relationships that you're entering into with no real way out. And so these people are investing billions of dollars when you aggregate all of this development, even all the conversions, and they want to have confidence that when they're signing up, they're going to make money, but they're signing up for a long time that they've got the right system that they're signing up for. And so the truth is our track record is really good. Our brands are performing really well. Our market share is the highest it's ever been. It's significantly higher than any of our competitors. And so that doesn't mean we don't have to compete. I say the same all the time. For this cool like, why don't we win every deal? Why should we -- why are we only winning half the deals even though we're, whatever, 6% of the global market. I'll let Kevin explain himself on that. But getting half the business is pretty darn good. And I think it ultimately comes down to our ability over a long period of time to be able to deliver performance for owners because we can be witty, charming, scrappy gritty, we can be all the things we think we are or hope to be. But in the end, it's about performance. They're investing money in these assets or -- and this relationship with us to drive returns. Thanks Robin. I would say the answer is we don't have a tremendous amount of incremental visibility. The place we obviously have the most visibility is in group, which is why we give you those statistics. That business is pretty darn sticky. We have found recently and over a long span of time, people have needs, they still have pent-up needs. So, we feel really good about that. But leisure and transient, I mean, leisure transient, transient, business our visibility is limited, certainly limited to 60 or 90 days out. But then anecdotally, particularly with business transient, just talking to all of our customers, which we do all the time, our sales teams, I do, others in senior management to. We survey them. We do have data that tells us what they're thinking, and that gives us a rationale for what I'm saying to you I think will happen next year. But they haven't booked the business yet. Unlike groups where they booked it, they haven't booked it and then leisure where we have the least visibility into the future. Now, the reason I started my whole answer in my filibuster with the consensus view was obviously not lost on you or anybody else, particularly in leisure and business transient as it relates to how we think about next year, a lot of it so goes the economy to a degree, so goes those segments. So, that's why it always has to start with a view, a consensus view of like what the heck do we think is going to happen in the economy. It's not that the group business is immune to it. It's just stickier. It just -- it is not as immune to short-term swings overtime as the other segments. So, that's -- it's about -- I mean, have we gotten better, do we have better listening posts with our customers than we might have had five years ago? Yes, I think so. I think we're better at understanding what's going on. The reality in terms of booking visibility is about the same. Good morning, Semdes. I'd say it's a little bit of everything. If you think about what's going on, certainly, the big city-wides are picking up and not surprisingly. They just -- we've been saying this on every call. This takes longer in gestation to get those -- that business going because they book multiple years in advance. They spend millions of dollars planning these events. And they went for two or three years unwilling and/or unable to do that. And so we're certainly seeing wind in our sales from that. But we're also seeing really good social group business. I mean people still want to get out and see people. I mean, that is still a thing. And then I'd say corporate meetings are -- we're seeing really terrific demand. I mean even though the workplace is sort of normalizing somewhat, it is not going back to where was. And the reality is a lot of people have needs and that they're making -- sort of up for a time when they were more remote. They needed meetings for innovation and culture building and the like. And a lot of people have sort of changed pretty permanently, us included. By the way, our work environment a way where we take less space because people are more mobile, and it requires them needing space outside of their own office footprint more than historically they have. And so, that's a nice little wind in our sail as well. So that's a long-winded way of saying it's broad-based. I mean there's -- it's not one thing driving it. Yes, I mean you're right, Brandt, it is super early, but in the sense that they just went in and sort of the middle end of the summer. And a lot of those properties are resorts in very unique locations that book way ahead of time. So, there's only so much data we have just given the time of year it came in. But the data that we do have is super good, meaning that our customers are engaging with it. They're looking at the availability of these properties. Now many of them this summer weren't available because they had already been booked given when they came in the system. They are -- where they did utilize it, they utilized it in a very healthy way for redemptions, which is exactly sort of the behavior set that we're looking for. And so I'd say obviously, a long way to go, but we feel very good about the ownership community and SLH feels very good about the start of the relationship. And I think as we get into the -- get a little bit of time, quarter or two and then certainly get into the spring and summer of next year, I think you'll see some real uptick. But you go in like if you go on our app, I had to do it. I was in Italy and Tuscany to meet some friends, where we have a few hotels go in the app and like hotels nearby me. And we went from having like three hotels to 40 hotels. So, -- and many of them are really small and very unique, but that's exactly what for a leisure, high-end leisure customer they're looking for. And so it really gives us significant enhancement in terms of shots on goal for people to book and importantly, for people to be able to dream that are road warriors and have a place to realize those dreams. Good morning, Mike. Yes, I mean it's interesting. I said earlier, so I don't want to contradict myself that obviously always like to see RevPAR higher. And so I will say it again, I'd always like to see it higher. But having said that, there are, and then you alluded to it in the approach to the question, there are benefits of the environment we're in. And we saw those benefits going back to that time where typically, we are able to deliver. If we do our jobs, better share in terms of performance on our existing assets. And we take in more difficult environments, environments where financing is less available, we end up disproportionately getting more conversions and more of what is available for new construction because our brands are just more financeable. And so that is certainly what we've been experiencing. If you look at the numbers across the board on development, whether you break it apart on new construction or conversions, you look at market share numbers, which continue, I mean, they're very high. So getting them -- they continue to grow. We've grown market share every single year in the eight, almost going on 18 years I've been here. So the higher you go, the harder it gets, but we're super focused on that. So I'm not giving you a specific answer because there isn't one, but this environment is not terrible for us in that way. And the really nice thing, as I think we demonstrated in the third quarter and we'll demonstrate for the full year, and I think we'll demonstrate again next year and the year after is the model is really resilient that even, I mean, think about it, even in the environment we're in where we're going to be in the twos on same store growth, we're going to deliver a circuit 10% EBITDA growth and higher than that in EPS and free cash flow. That doesn't -- I mean, that doesn't feel so bad. Imagine what can be done in an even better environment from a same store point of view. So that's not -- as I said, I know I'm not answering it specifically. But these conditions are -- we feel like whatever -- I guess I'd finalize it by saying we can't determine the macro. What we can do always is outperform competition. And so we feel good about in this environment, our ability to do that. We feel good about that. And our job is in every environment to do that, but we -- yes, and we will, but we feel we -- we're not -- this is not a terrible environment in terms of our ability to deliver. It hasn't really shifted. I mean, obviously inflation is down broadly, use the US because it's our biggest market and we're here, sitting here in the US. And inflation is not running 8% to 10%, but it's still running four plus against the target of two, which I think personally will be a long time coming just because of the underlying strength in the broader economy. And one thing we didn't talk about yet is the basic fiscal spending between shifts and inflation reduction and infrastructure. You put all that stuff together, forget the private sector, there's a huge amount of public sector spending going on. And I think all of that sort of underpins growth and non-residential fixed investment, which drives a lot of demand in our business, which I think continues to give us a decent amount of rate integrity. And so our expectation is while that isn't -- is moderating from the hypercharge levels that you saw generally of inflation across a lot of sectors and we expect the same thing in ours, we still expect that there's a decent amount of pricing pressure. And so as we think about, by the way, we have very sophisticated revenue management models that it's not Christmas with its hand on the button deciding the rate of every room every night, thankfully. But we have very sophisticated systems. But those systems and all of our data scientists here at Hilton still believe that given those conditions in most segments at most times, there is good pricing integrity. The one area that I talked about where probably less by nature, if you think demand might be flat or going down a little bit as leisure normalizes, particularly on weekends, there may be a little bit less pressure there. But broadly, as I said, Mike, I think when we finish this year and next, I think leisure rates will be up. Not a lot, but I think leisure rates will be up just because of the underlying macro conditions. I don't know if that answered it, but the short answer is not nothing material that we see that's different in the last few months, certainly. Good morning. Yes. Chad, thanks. And to everybody that joined, thank you for the time. Obviously, a lot going on in the world. But we're really happy with how the third quarter worked out. We feel good about the fourth and the full year. And as we've talked about quite a bit today, I feel good about the setup for 2025. We look forward to catching up with you after the years out and be a little bit more specific on 2025 at that point. And I hope everybody has a good end of the year and great holiday season when you get to it. It's funny to hear myself say that, but it's that time of year. Anyway, thanks again for the time today."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Head of Development Operations and Investor Relations. You may begin.\nJill Chapman: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today\u2019s call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company\u2019s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our second quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Nassetta: Thank you. Jill good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report strong second quarter results with RevPAR growth driving adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high end of our guidance. We continued to execute on our successful development strategy and in July our system surpassed 8000 hotels globally. Our newly acquired brands and recent strategic partnerships will help us build even more loyalty with guests, further enhancing our network effect and increasing our industry leading RevPar premiums. Coupled with our asset light fee based business model, we are well positioned to continue producing significant free cash flow and driving meaningful shareholder returns in the quarter. In the quarter, system-wide, RevPAR increased 3.5% year-over-year above the midpoint of guidance due to robust group performance, continued recovery in business transient and easier holiday comparisons. Transient RevPAR grew 2% year-over-year with increases in both business and leisure demand. RevPAR across large corporates rose 5% in the quarter, driven by strong trends across most industries, including notable recover in technology. Leisure transient RevPAR continued to exceed prior peaks, supported by solid summer travel demand, particularly in international markets. Group RevPAR rose more than 10% year-over-year, led by strong demand for corporate and social meetings and events and booking windows continued to lengthen. For the full year group position is up 10% over last year, with position up mid-teens over the next several years. We expect full year system-wide RevPAR to increase 2% to 3% driven by positive growth across all major segments and regions. We tempered the high end of our expectations versus prior guidance due to softer trends in certain international markets and normalizing leisure growth more broadly. With continued strength in group and steady recovery in business transient, we expect higher end chain scales to continue to outperform. Turning to development in the quarter, we opened 165 hotels totaling more than 22,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 6.2%. We marked several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 6000th hotel in North America, and we surpassed 75,000 home two suites rooms globally. We also opened seven new resort properties in Europe, including the debut of Curio in Croatia and DoubleTree in Malta. We welcome graduate hotels and NoMad into our family of brands during the quarter, providing further opportunities to deliver exceptional guest experiences and accelerate our expansion in the fast growing lifestyle segment. Demand for lifestyle products continues to increase as guests seek unique experiences and sought after destinations around the world. In the last year, we have expanded our lifestyle offerings by more than 30%, fueled largely by growth in Curio, Tapestry and the recent acquisition of Graduate. With roughly 400 lifestyle properties today and hundreds more in the pipeline, we are well positioned for substantial growth over the next several years. Conversions accounted for roughly half of openings in the quarter, driven by the addition of Graduate and the continued strength from DoubleTree and Spark. In the quarter, Spark opened 27 hotels, more than doubling its existing supply. The brand also celebrated its debut in Europe with the opening of Spark by Hilton London Romford, just nine months after the first property opened in the U.S. The opening marks the start of an exciting journey for Spark to redefine the premium economy segment in Europe, with further launches of the brand across Continental Europe expected in the coming months. In the quarter, we signed 63,000 rooms, increasing our pipeline to approximately 508,000 rooms, which is up 8% from last quarter and 15% year-over-year, with notable strength across the EMEA and APAC regions. In particular, Hilton Garden Inn continued to gain tremendous traction with year-to-date signings, up nearly 90% across 20 different countries. Overall, conversions accounted for over half of the signings in the quarter, driven by additions from our acquisitions and partnerships. Excluding acquisitions and partnerships, conversions accounted for 25% of signings in the quarter, largely driven by continued momentum with Curio, Tapestry and DoubleTree. System-wide construction starts in the quarter were up 160% versus last year and up 37% excluding acquisitions and partnerships. With meaningful growth across both the U.S. and international markets, we remain on track to exceed prior peak levels of starts by year-end. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more than 20% of industry share and nearly four times our existing share of supply. We've seen tremendous interest from owners through our exclusive agreement with small luxury hotels of the world. With the pace of initial property signups far exceeding our expectations under our strategic partnership, we added nearly 300 boutique luxury properties to our system in July, with an additional 100 properties expected to join later this year. Adding these unique properties to our network is highly complementary to our existing luxury portfolio and significantly increases our luxury offerings for guests around the world without any capital commitment. During the quarter, the first AutoCamp properties were added to our platforms. Each AutoCamp location provides a unique opportunity for guests to immerse themselves in nature without sacrificing the comforts of high end accommodations. These exclusive agreements with SLH and AutoCamp provides Honors members with new and exciting ways to earn and redeem points while broadening and enhancing our network effect. As a result of our strong pipeline recent tuck-in acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we now expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5% for the full year. We are also proud to continue to be recognized for our industry leading brands and culture. Brand finance recently ranked Hilton as the most valuable hotel brand for the 9th consecutive year, claiming nine of the top 50 hotel brand spots. Additionally, Hilton was recently named the top workplace in the U.S. for millennials by Great Place to Work and Fortune for the 7th consecutive year. Since 2016, we've received over 540 recognitions as a Great Place to Work across more than 60 countries and we remain the number one great place to Work in the World and the United States. We're very happy with our second quarter results, development milestones and brand and commercial enhancements which we think demonstrate the continued strength of our business model. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the results in the quarter and our expectations for the year.\nKevin Jacobs: Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.5% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by strong international performance and continued recovery. Adjusted EBITDA was $917 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was driven by better than expected fee growth, largely due to better than expected U.S. RevPAR performance and some timing items. Management franchise fees grew 10% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items was $1.91. Turning to our regional performance, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR was up 3%, driven by strong group performance, particularly in urban markets. In the Americas outside the U.S. second quarter, RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year, driven by strong results in leisure markets. In Europe, RevPAR grew 7% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments and continued strength from international inbound travel. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 11% year-over-year with growth in both rate and occupancy led by strong group and leisure performance. In the Asia Pacific region second quarter, RevPAR was up 1% year-over-year. RevPAR in APAC ex-China increased 11%, led by continued strength in Japan and Korea. China RevPAR declined 5% in the quarter with difficult year-over-year domestic travel comparisons and limited international inbound travel negatively affecting results, which weighed on RevPAR results for the region but accounts for less than 3% of overall fees. Turning to development, we ended the quarter with approximately 508,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 15% year-over-year, with approximately 60% of those rooms located outside the U.S. and nearly half of them under construction. For the full year, we expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5%. Moving to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 3% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $875 million and $890 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items to be between $1.80 and $1.85. For full year 2024, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 3%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.375 billion and $3.405 billion. We are bringing down the high end of our guidance to reflect slightly lower RevPAR growth expectations and FX movements. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.93 and $7.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate further share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $37 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter year. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, and for the full year we expect to return approximately $3 billion. Further details on our second quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you give us a little bit more detail. Obviously on the net rooms growth side of things. Chris and Kevin, clearly going to 7% to 7.5% is obviously a very good thing. Can you talk about what's added versus a quarter ago with particular attention with SLS and some of the newly acquired brands, as well as maybe what's different on a sort of organic same brand basis versus a quarter ago?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, I'd be happy to. I think the way to think about it is what's being added essentially is, is Graduate. I mean, if you look at our prior guidance, we had incorporated a guesstimate on what we would do for SLH. We are doing better than that. And so I think in the end that's going to probably be about a point and a half of NUG Graduate, which we said would be separate and apart is about a half a point. And so I think if you sort of unwind all that and compare it against prior guidance, the organic is slightly less, but has 100% to do with some things that are just moving from the fourth quarter into the, into the first quarter of next year. But as we were, as I said in my comments, in terms of feeling good about what's going on the development side, I mean, for the full year, we're going to hit historically high levels on signings. We're going to hit historically high levels on starts. And that is both of those, excluding any sort of partnerships or acquisitions. And obviously that's been translating into very good results. We feel very good about the momentum into next year. Most everybody was at our investor day in the spring where we articulated a sort of algorithm story of 6% to 7% organically. And we feel very, very good about being able to deliver on that. Obviously, this year is going to be above the higher end of that because of some of the inorganic things. But if we fast forward to next year, our expectation certainly is organically. We will be, we will be solidly in that range just given the signings, the starts and looking at how that's going to play out in the next couple of years.\nJoe Greff: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey Chris, I think you addressed most of what I was going to ask, but at the end of your remarks there, you did talk about organic growth and the outline you laid out at the analyst day. When you think about contract acquisition spend over the next several years and acknowledging kind of that 6% net unit growth range. Should we be thinking something similar to what you've been spending in terms of contract acquisition spend this year to date, last, etcetera?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Well, last year was elevated because of a few very specific deals, which we've noted over the last couple of calls. This year will moderate and be lower than last year. And I think on a go-forward basis, I'd look at the next year as it sort of being comparable to where we'll end up this year. We're not really seeing any material difference. Notwithstanding a lot of noise in the market, I think in the quarter. Kevin helped me. We, our key money percentage of deals in second quarter was like 7% or 8%. Overall key money is still less than 10%. So 90 plus percent, fully free of any form of incentive. And we haven't really seen those stats really move around a whole lot. Again, we had an elevated year or two coming out of COVID because we got some really cool opportunities on some very big super high end luxury and sort of resort convention type assets. And we took advantage of that. But we're getting back to more normalized levels, which again will be lower than last year, this year. And I think we'll continue at that kind of level over the next two or three years.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thanks. And then you mentioned group pace plus ten for this year. And the outlook for the next few years you mentioned was mid-teens. In terms of 2025, 2026, what kind of percentage of your expected group room nights is on the books at present for 2025\u2026\nChristopher Nassetta: I don\u2019t have the exact number in my head, but I would guess at this point, for 2025, it's probably 40% to 50%. And for 2026, it's probably a quarter, something like that. By the end of the year, we'll be for 2025, we'll probably cross over at 60% to 70%. Those would be sort of the typical numbers. And group is sort of getting back to pre-COVID typical levels. Like, even if you look in the second quarter group mix, it was pretty much at where we were pre-COVID. I mean, of overall mix in Q2 was 20%, which is exactly what it was, pre-COVID. So it's sort of, Group it's taken a while because of the long lead nature of it and planning and all that goes into it, particularly with the larger groups and the citywides. But that, that's sort of, now hitting on all cylinders and normalizing. So, yes, I would think it'd be in those percentages. So I think it's a, they're a very good indicator if we sit around this very table, with all of our senior team, including head of sales and his team, and they feel very good. They're not. There's no sense of sort of slowing on demand and pricing, and the group demand, pricing and overall attitude in that segment remains quite good, quite strong. And as I mentioned in the comments, the booking window is extending. I mean, our overall booking window extended in the quarter. And at this point, pretty much the booking window is back to, obviously got super short during COVID but it's pretty much now back to normalized level extended in the second quarter and pretty much got us back to pre-COVID levels. The Group booking window continues to extend just because people have to go further out. There's just not enough space available for their needs.\nCarlo Santarelli: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\nChristopher Nassetta: Good morning, Shaun.\nShaun Kelley: Morning, Chris. So, wanted to maybe just go high level and get a few of your views on the latest on the consumer engineering, maybe the broader macro. Obviously, a lot of cross currents out there. I think what we continue to see repeatedly is some softness and leisure at the margin in the U.S., contrasting that with the fairly solid corporate environment. But behaviorally, what caught your eye just operationally through the quarter as we got into maybe the summer travel season. What do you think is changing at the margin? Thanks.\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, a great question. And obviously we spent a lot of time talking to people and looking at a lot of data in our business. Let me do it maybe through the lens of walking around the world a little bit to talk about what's going on. So starting with maybe I'll finish at home, start with Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific, as you heard in Kevin's commentary, is sort of a tale of two cities, China and then APAC ex-China. So in China, I think Kevin covered it nicely. In China, there is actually a very significant amount of travel going on. We do expect to end the year sort of down probably circa 5%. But what's going on in China is obviously they have economic issues, so their economy is slow, but really the travel business is still quite robust. But what's happening is they've opened up a lot of corridors for inter Asia travel that is visa free. And Chinese travelers love to travel and they're getting out of China and they're going around and there's just not enough inbound travel yet into China. There's not enough flights from Europe and the U.S. and other parts of the world to compensate for that, and that's going to take time. I mean, I was there during the quarter at a U.S. China travel summit that the State Department sponsored with their equivalent, and we were talking about, how we're going to get, stimulate more travel, more flights. And by the way, the flights have tripled or quadrupled, even since then. So, I mean, there is progress, but it's still going to take some time. So I think, China is a complex story, but that's what's going on. People, travel in aggregate similar to where it was sort of not better or worse, but more people leaving, not enough coming in. I suspect over the next year or two, we will get to a different place. Hopefully their economy start to pick up, but you'll have a lot more inbound travel. The rest of Asia Pacific quite strong, particularly led by Korea and Japan. And we haven't seen any real signs of weakening in those markets. And I should say India, for that matter. No real signs of weakening. And those are the real APAC ex-China markets that are driving performance. And then coming to EMEA, again, sort of a bit of a tale to cities. The Middle East remains quite strong pretty much across the board. Europe, I would say, is still very, very strong in an absolute sense, but a touch weaker than what we had seen a quarter ago, led by what you're talking, implied in your question, which is some of the leisure business. Again, you're still at the high end of high single digit sort of year-over-year growth. So it's not like it's a it's not a bad story. It's just a little it's come off just a little bit. And then coming, coming, I could keep lots of other places in the world, but these are the big markets. It\u2019s coming home to the U.S. is exactly what's implied and sort of what you would guess from what I've already said. If you break apart the segments, Group is still raging, business transient is still grinding up, not at a rapid pace, but still grinding up. Both of those segments maintaining great pricing power. And then leisure transient has been normalizing, because we're just getting back to a more normal life. And it was at very elevated levels, particularly on weekends, but broadly and so we continue to see sort of normalization there. And the consumer, if you break it apart, and sort of segments in the lower sort of half of consumers, maybe even the lower three quarters. I mean, you can read the data is all out there. They had bank accounts, and checking accounts full of money coming out of COVID. They've spent all that money. They're now borrowing more. And so, they have less available, less disposable income and capacity to do anything, including travel. You go up to the upper echelons and people still have pretty fat bank accounts and checking accounts and wherewithal. And so, what the impact of that is, some continued normalization on leisure transient. And the reason I use normalization is not to be cute. I mean, for the full year, if you look at it, we think we will globally see growth in all segments. I said that quickly in my prepared comments. It'll be very, very low in leisure transient, but positive a little bit, higher on business transient and then, very, very strong for the reasons I've described on meetings and events. So it is not, at least in our world and what we have seen year-to-date and what we expect for the rest of the year, it's not cratering in any way. It's just soft. It's but definitely softening for the reasons I described.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you so much.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Hi, thanks. We'd love to hear some incremental detail on effectively the non-RevPAR related fees, both within the management and franchise fees, as well as the other revenue line, as we just think about, how the outlook has changed and any puts and takes to think about not only this year, but maybe longer term.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Sure, Stephen. I think, look, obviously, those -- the non-RevPAR-driven fees outperformed. We still had very strong core fee growth in the quarter based on our algorithm but non-RevPAR-driven fees outperformed in the first half of the year. Some of that is a little bit of timing as it relates to the over the trajectory of the quarters of this year. And, but I'd say longer term, all of those parts of the business, right, we've talked about license fees. We've talked about other income. We've talked about ancillary lines of business at our Investor Day, all of those parts of the business should continue to grow at algorithm or above over time. So you're seeing a little bit of timing issues this year, but then over time, it should be additive to the algorithm overall.\nStephen Grambling: And just to clarify, are the timing issues just related to deals that were struck partnerships that were struck or just lapping over changes in terms?\nKevin Jacobs: Not on partnerships or deals just a little bit of comparability year-over-year and just a little bit of strength in the early part of the year in some of those parts of the business.\nStephen Grambling: Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: And -- I should say, a handful of onetime items in there, but nothing related to the partnerships.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And it's perfectly suited because I wanted to follow on to the prior one, which is related to non-RevPAR fees. Can you talk a bit about your ability to affect or influence that growth meaning is there just more resource toward identifying and executing on those opportunities? Or is the world just evolving in a way that's sort of driving that growth on your behalf which benefits from your scale?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean, being born to raise the control freak, nothing. I don't view anything is outside of some ability to have influence, not that maybe the broad macro, which we'll, I'm sure, talk more about at some point. So there are, David, a bunch of different things we can do. I'm not going to get into granular detail. But I mean you can see it in some of the actions that we publicly talk about like with our AmEx co-brand cards and the things that we're doing there to sort of reintroduce cards, change the benefits. And so I think I think the way you should look at it is, as Kevin described, we're in constant state of dialogue with all of our third-party partners on how to maximize these cards. We have a very serious seat at the table. We have lots of sort of contractual rights built into our relationship. But we also in the bulk of and particularly in our largest one with American Express have a long-standing and very close partnership. It's always in both of our interest to be making sure these things are performing. And so we both have dedicated teams in our companies, in the case of AmEx, we and they, but in our other partnerships that we have as well. And we have people literally grinding every day to figure out what or to figure out what the -- what we could do to modify the offer to customers to ultimately get them more to sign up in the case of co-brand and to enhance their desire to spend. We're in constant dialogue with like Hilton Grand Vacations. If you think about it, AmEx and HGV are probably the two biggest about the value proposition there. You can see in a very material way, we were deeply involved in the Bluegreen and Diamond acquisitions. Those were things that we worked on very closely with them to ultimately drive a much better outcome by effectively creating new brands within that space. So I can go on and on. The short answer is we don't leave anything for chance. I mean we're all over this stuff. We have rights, and we have great partnerships, and we are very aligned always trying to figure out how to modify programs and adjust the offers to customers to drive better outcomes.\nDavid Katz: Super helpful. Lots more in this. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Hi, thanks. Just circling back to the unit growth guide for next year. You have -- I think it's something like 30% more rooms under construction than you did in 2019 if my math is right. So you don't really necessarily need an acceleration in conversions, but some others are talking about that. I wonder if you could just sort of characterize what you think is going on in the conversion environment in terms of are there things that would drive that to accelerate in 2025 or -- for [indiscernible]\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean I agree. -- that's why I feel good about being in the 6% to 7% range. I mean, effectively, if you take out all the partnerships and everything, it is by being solidly in that range, it is accelerating. So it is organically reflective of the strength conversions, we do think are accelerating. I mean, for the full year, we're going to have conversions over 50%. But again, that's in part driven by partnerships, acquisition and partnership. If you strip all of that stuff out conversions are going to go from like 30% to just under 40%. So we are having great success in conversions. We believe strongly that has everything to do with the strength of our brands and the strength of our commercial engines driving better outcomes for our owners. And so we are getting a hugely disproportionate share of conversions. And if we do our job, which we intend to do, we think that will continue. So being solidly in 6% to 7% next year, it is reflective of the benefit of the acceleration we're seeing in signing starts, conversions, all of that baked in. It's obviously a little bit early in that it's August to give the number -- to give a tighter range. But as we get closer to it, we will, but we feel very comfortable being solidly in that range.\nRobin Farley: Great. It's very helpful. And then if I could, just one clarification. Kevin's comments on kind of the timing of fee growth and that the first half outperformed and the idea that it will -- over time, it will -- that sort of algorithm is sustained. Just does that mean like sort of for the full year, the algorithm will be the same? Or was that more that like I'm just thinking about it in second half would be slightly below algorithm, but the full year still comes in, in line or with the comment that...\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. If you look at our guidance that is what is implied. I mean we -- the first part of the year in terms of -- I don't know what metric you're looking at. But if you just look at EBITDA growth, it will be higher in the first half of the year because of some of the stuff that Kevin was talking about on timing. As a result, it will be lower. But for the full year, it will be in the ranges we talked about, which when I rounded is sort of like EBITDA growth of 10%. I mean, I think -- and I'm patting us on the back, but I guess that's my job. I mean when I think about what's going on in the world and our ability to do that, I think it's striking. The reality is, as much as I said, I'm a control freak, and I wish we could control everything. We don't control the macro. You know that better than we do. And the macro environment is weakening a touch, okay? That's just what's going on, not dramatically so, but it's weakening a touch thus, why we brought the top end of our RevPAR guidance down and the top have shaved a little bit of the top end of our EBITDA guidance. Frankly, a lot of that shape had to do with FX changes honestly. If you take out FX, it didn't really move a whole lot from an EBITDA point of view. But even in the face of all that, at the same time that RevPAR, the midpoint of RevPAR is coming down, the midpoint of unit growth is going up, and the result is pretty much the same, which is if you think about back to Investor Day, we said we're going to deliver plus or minus 10% EBITDA growth on average, we\u2019re going to do it even in an environment that I would argue from a macro point of view is not super strong and softening a touch because of the success that we're having in executing what I think is a very thoughtful plan and strategy on the development side, we are still getting to circa 10% EBITDA growth in that environment. And I think that is a demonstration, both of the resilience of the core business and the model, and this is the pat us on the back, and I'm patting Kevin on the back as he runs this development, the success that we're having in what is a really good development strategy being super well executed.\nRobin Farley: Great. Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. Just I guess to follow up on the growth outlook a little bit. Just looking at sort of the implied RevPAR ranges at kind of one and change to three and change through the back half of the year. I mean, is the higher end just a reflection of maybe what happens with the U.S. economic growth? Or is there something else in particular that you think could drive you towards the higher end of that implied outlook?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I mean it implies 2% to 3% really for both quarters, Smedes. I think if you think about it, if you look at what's going on so far in the third quarter, it has been a touch softer. And as we get into the fourth quarter, the expectation would be as the bigger business travel months of October and the first part of November kick in, particularly in the U.S., that there would be a little bit of strengthening in RevPAR growth. As supported by -- also by, I should mention by our group position. So if you think about that and then if you think about the mix of the business, we still are largely 70% plus or minus of our revenue comes from the United States. And so what happens in the U.S. will be a driver, but supported by our group position supported by strength in the bigger group hotels in the urban markets, we think -- and what we think will be stronger business travel in the early part of the fourth quarter, that's kind of what's playing out over the balance sheet here.\nSmedes Rose: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And the next question is from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandt Montour: Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.\nChristopher Nassetta: Good morning.\nBrandt Montour: Good morning. So Chris and Kevin, so implied in the fact that EBITDA, the guidance for the full year didn't really come down but you did cut RevPAR, we're left to assume that there's some incremental fees potentially from that extra NUG from SLH. Correct me if I'm wrong there. But the follow-on question is, if you could just remind us the economics of the SLH hotels and what you're implying to sort of accruing fees from them as we go through the rest of the year?\nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I think your implication is right. Some of it is fees doing better in SLA. Some of it's non-RevPAR fees doing better. And the way to think about economics on SLH's we get sort of normal fees relative to what we would get a typical franchise arrangement. But for the fact that we get paid on the business we generate there versus 100% of revenues. Now recognize that the average rate of these hotels is probably 5 times to 7 times -- 6 times or 7 times our system-wide average rate. So in the end, we feel very good about the economics.\nBrandt Montour: Okay. That's super helpful. And then the follow-on question is just a clarification on some of your comments, Kevin, on the back half RevPAR I know U.S. is the big one, but U.S. and China may be taken separately, what are you implying for the back half on those two buckets versus the July run rate? Are you implying any reacceleration or sort of straight lining or what's qualitatively what you guys are thinking there?\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I mean, we didn't -- we haven't given a July run rate for us. But if you look at what's going on in the industry, it does imply an acceleration in the back half of the year relative to July, if that's your specific question.\nChristopher Nassetta: And I think that acceleration, Kevin said this, Brant would be fourth quarter oriented. I think third quarter, you will likely see -- you're in a transition where leisure is softer and you don't have all the business travel and the meetings and events. So third quarter, if you look at it, third versus fourth. I think third quarter will be weaker, fourth quarter a lot stronger for the reasons Kevin described. One, we end -- we fully expect a more normalized business transient travel, particularly as you get a week or so past Labor Day. And in October, November, it will get cooking, and we have a very strong group base in the fourth quarter that supports a stronger fourth quarter than third.\nBrandt Montour: Perfect. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: And the next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Scholes: Hello good morning everyone.\nChristopher Nassetta: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: Have you seen any impact on ADR growth or even customer demand from bundling the hotel rate and the resort or amenity fees into a single rate quote? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: No, not yet. I think, look, it's sort of early days on sort of those changes. But I mean, really, in the end, that's about more transparency, and we do not see any impact to AV. We have not seen any impact nor do we expect any from that change.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. And a follow-up question may for Kevin. You folks have done exceptionally well with EBITDA margin expansion really far and away the best in my coverage universe since 2019. Any high-level thoughts about how much more room you have to go? Or how should we think about potential for EBITDA margin growth over the next several years. Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, thanks for the question, Patrick. We appreciate that because we think it's been a very good story. We talked about this a little bit at the Investor Day, but for those who weren't there or need a reminder, we think there's 50 to 100 basis points a year of embedded margin growth increases in the business as we shift, obviously, the growth in the business is all through the fee segment. So those fees come in at 100% margin and improve the margins of the business. And so that, combined with really good cost control, which I think we have like Chris said earlier, I think we'll pat ourselves on the back a little bit on that. I think we're really good about being disciplined about cost control. And so what that's done is you can see our margins are 1,000 basis points higher than they were pre-COVID, and we think that, that will continue to grow. Again, there will be different there'll be puts and takes depending on what's going on in the economy and how we do and where we are relative to our annual algorithm projections. But for the most part, you should think about it as 50 to 100 basis points -- embedded growth.\nChristopher Nassetta: And some years there'll be better somewhere. This is going to be a year that's best. So I think we will -- we expect to be over 100 basis points in EBITDA margin growth this year.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay, thank you for the clarity.\nOperator: And the next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on conversions, which for you guys and a lot of your peers are just becoming a bigger component of net unit growth? And maybe said differently, more predictable piece. So as you think about the net unit growth beyond in 2025 and 2026 and some of the new brands that you've rolled out, which are helping on conversions, should this lift just in terms of percentage of NUG. And how does the cycle play into that with rates coming down? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. It's a really good question. I think it's obviously a bit of both. I mean we've had years in the past. This is the part of the cycle where particularly when capital gets more constrained and more expensive for new builds. And this is the part of the cycle where you typically lead into conversions because they're just easier to finance. You've got a trading hotel, you've got -- it's cash flowing. We are obviously leaning in to our lifestyle brands, which our soft brands tend to be more driven towards conversions. Spark is a 100% conversion brand. So we are doing things strategically to increase our share of conversion. So I think it's both. I think it's -- part of it's cyclical in nature. You said -- like I said, you've seen times when conversions have been a bigger part of the story. This is a part of that cycle. But some of these are like, I don't want to say permanent, but sort of semi-permanently we're doing things strategically to focus on being able to take share, and we're doing it. I think I think last year for the full year, we were something like 40% of the conversion deals done in the entire U.S. We're higher than that so far this year. And so our -- the network effect we create, the RevPAR next we drive the fact that our brands are stronger and the fact that we're strategically focusing on it, I think should mean that it's additive to the overall growth trajectory of the company over time rather than just being cyclical, but cyclicality matters as well.\nChad Beynon: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey good morning. Thank you. Just on Spark, you mentioned 27 hotels. Any themes in terms of the brands or types of properties that are converting from and what the average investment by owners is? And then my follow-up on the 400 SLH, generally, where are they located? And any more detail you can offer about the profile of these properties coming in as well? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. So I'll take the first part, I would say, on Spark, is everything is going the way we thought and the way it's planned. I mean, 95-plus percent of them are from third-party brands. I think I'm not going to get into specifically which brands those are from, but I think people can figure that out, and it's been sort of what we've expected. And the owner investment is coming in, in line with what we thought. There have been a little bit of increases in construction costs as has been well documented in the industry, but still coming in within the ranges. And then so far, early days, the RevPAR index, the performance of the hotels has been quite strong and again, maybe even a little bit better than what we've expected, which is creating momentum in that area. And then SLH breaks down 60% in EMEA, 20% in the Americas and 20% in Asia Pacific. And I'd say that they're small hotels, by definition, small luxury hotels. I think on average, they're 45 rooms to 50 rooms, something like that. As we've talked about, really unique properties in really high rated, high RevPAR markets, and that's all been -- I think the pace of people signing up has been better than we thought, but the profile is exactly what we thought when we went into it.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDan Politzer: Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on China. I believe you said that China was 30% of overall fees. I assume that over indexes in terms of the incentive management fees. But how should we think about that relative to that line item? And maybe any guide guardrails for incentive management fees as we think about the rest of the year and as it relates to China.\nKevin Jacobs: No. I think, look, for China, it doesn't -- it's no different than our normal fee structure. If we manage -- it's basically off the top and a percentage of GOP at the bottom. So that's not really different than any of our other international management agreements. And then now we're growing a big franchise business now in China. So that's just straight franchise fees, right? 5%-ish franchise fees off the top. And so that's really the fee composition in China is really in line with the broader business. And then for IMF, there's a couple of things going on with IMF. This maybe isn't exactly what you asked, but we've got a little bit of FX. We've got a couple of contracts that converted from management to franchise sort of at the same economics. So you're just seeing some shifts from 1 IMF segment to the other. If you adjust for those two factors and a couple of timing items IMF would be sort of low double-digit growth for the year, so a little bit better than the overall business, and it's, I think, 9% or 10% of fees. So nothing much really going on there.\nDan Politzer: Thank you. Helpful.\nOperator: And our next question is from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just looking at some of the other regions like Middle East and Africa, Asia, ex-China, the ones that are really delivering the double-digit growth at the moment. Just your outlook for that for the second half. Can they keep that pace of momentum? Or are we going to sort of see a convergence of global RevPAR around your guidance number?\nChristopher Nassetta: No, I think we feel good about the second half in those regions that are really performing at that level. As I was trying to say when I did my little around the world exercise, we do think there's softening in certain segments, in certain parts of the world for the reasons I described. But not we think APAC ex-China is going to have a very good second half of the year. We think Middle East Africa will as well in those two cases. And those are the two that are really at the highest levels of RevPAR performance.\nRichard Clarke: And then maybe just a clarification. Maybe this is related to your previous comment, Kevin. But I noticed that think about 1,000 Waldorf Astoria rooms have left the system and about 300 Conrad. I guess that's probably Edinburgh and the New York one. But just any color around those hotels leaving the system and what it means for those brands.\nKevin Jacobs: No. I mean the -- we had a couple of Waldorfs that we converted to actually stayed in the system and converted to different brands. These are a couple of the hotels that have been in Waldorf for a long time kind of going back to when Waldorf was more of a collection brand than sort of the brand it is today. And so other than the one you mentioned in New York, the Waldorf that shifted out have stayed in the system and they're now -- one is an LXR and two of them are Curios.\nChristopher Nassetta: And that was at our urging, with what we're strategically trying to do with Waldorf, if you think about all the existing Waldorf, the new [Indiscernible] that are coming. Waldorf is really hitting on all cylinders. The product is extraordinary. The new products are off the charts. And so there are like any brand that's been around for a while, there are some that really don't quite fit the bill. But the good news is with 24 brands, we have a home for -- not for everything, but we have a home for those things. And those properties that that left Walter are terrific properties that just weren't sort of meeting the mark on Waldorf, but they met the mark in other brands.\nRichard Clarke: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kopelman: Well thanks a lot. Just a couple of quick housekeeping. The first one is on your FX assumption. Is it safe to assume that, that was set before the U.S. dollar kind of started weakening on Friday? And then the second one was, if you could -- could you give us pipeline approvals in the second quarter ex-Graduate? Thanks.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. So the first one, the answer is no. I mean, technically, our forecast was set before Friday, but I don't think the Friday's move is going to have a material effect on the full year for FX. It's just it did -- as we mentioned. It did get a little bit worse over the -- become a little bit more of a headwind over the course of the quarter, which affected our guidance range for the full year. And then sorry, the second part of your question?\nKevin Kopelman: The second one was just you had that huge approvals number. I think some of it was maybe incorporating graduate hotels, but I know underlying was also strong. If you could just give us pipeline approvals ex-Graduate.\nChristopher Nassetta: We gave it -- it's in the press.\nKevin Jacobs: It's in the press release.\nChristopher Nassetta: 4,000 and change.\nKevin Jacobs: And you're right. It does incorporate both momentum in the existing brands and the new stuff. I'd say that's pretty strong.\nKevin Kopelman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just on the conversations with developers, I'm just curious on how that's changed over the past six months. I assume that there's a lot more comfortability around financing and credit availability. And then another one, just Airbnb called out booking presentation on just longer-term rentals. I mean, I realize your extended stay business is not exactly the same. But are you seeing any hesitancy on the longer but curve stuff in general? Thank you.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes. No, the second part is easy. We're not. And I think I'm not going to comment on what Airbnb said, and you haven't had a ton of time to study what they said, but that's a very different business. The composition of their business, 90%, 95% leisure all long-term stay. So I'll let them comment on that part of the business. We're not seeing any changes. And Chris even talked about booking windows normalizing and things like that earlier in the call. So nothing there. And then sorry, the first part was...\nConor Cunningham: Just on the evolution of your discussions with developers. It seems like -- yes.\nKevin Jacobs: Yes, I'd say they're largely consistent. I mean developers remain excited about the future for travel and the setup I think that overall capital is a little bit less expensive than it was, right? It's coming off of peaks. I think there's an expectation that it will come down there is -- it is a more constrained credit environment based on the lending community's views of the macro and what they're worried about is going to happen. But there's still capital available for good projects, which is why you're seeing our construction starts go up. And we're taking share in environments where capital is more constrained. We've said this a bunch of times, but rising tides lift all boats when the tide is going out, the stronger brands that are -- that lenders have more confidence lending to and developers have more confidence affiliating their hotels with are going to take share, and that's what's happening.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate, thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.\nChristopher Nassetta: Thank you, Chad, and thank you, as always, for spending an hour of your day with us. Obviously, we're super pleased with being able to deliver on second quarter, and we feel very good about our outlook for the full year, as I described, while the macro environment is a little bit weaker. Our development story is incrementally stronger and the net result is pretty much our ability to deliver an algorithm, which we're excited about. We will look forward to catching up with you after the third quarter to give you the latest and greatest. And hope everybody enjoys what you can on the rest of summer. Take care, and thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.5% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by strong international performance and continued recovery. Adjusted EBITDA was $917 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was driven by better than expected fee growth, largely due to better than expected U.S. RevPAR performance and some timing items. Management franchise fees grew 10% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items was $1.91. Turning to our regional performance, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR was up 3%, driven by strong group performance, particularly in urban markets. In the Americas outside the U.S. second quarter, RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year, driven by strong results in leisure markets. In Europe, RevPAR grew 7% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments and continued strength from international inbound travel. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 11% year-over-year with growth in both rate and occupancy led by strong group and leisure performance. In the Asia Pacific region second quarter, RevPAR was up 1% year-over-year. RevPAR in APAC ex-China increased 11%, led by continued strength in Japan and Korea. China RevPAR declined 5% in the quarter with difficult year-over-year domestic travel comparisons and limited international inbound travel negatively affecting results, which weighed on RevPAR results for the region but accounts for less than 3% of overall fees. Turning to development, we ended the quarter with approximately 508,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 15% year-over-year, with approximately 60% of those rooms located outside the U.S. and nearly half of them under construction. For the full year, we expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5%. Moving to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 3% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $875 million and $890 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items to be between $1.80 and $1.85. For full year 2024, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 3%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.375 billion and $3.405 billion. We are bringing down the high end of our guidance to reflect slightly lower RevPAR growth expectations and FX movements. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.93 and $7.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate further share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $37 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter year. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, and for the full year we expect to return approximately $3 billion. Further details on our second quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question? Yes. Sure, Stephen. I think, look, obviously, those -- the non-RevPAR-driven fees outperformed. We still had very strong core fee growth in the quarter based on our algorithm but non-RevPAR-driven fees outperformed in the first half of the year. Some of that is a little bit of timing as it relates to the over the trajectory of the quarters of this year. And, but I'd say longer term, all of those parts of the business, right, we've talked about license fees. We've talked about other income. We've talked about ancillary lines of business at our Investor Day, all of those parts of the business should continue to grow at algorithm or above over time. So you're seeing a little bit of timing issues this year, but then over time, it should be additive to the algorithm overall. Not on partnerships or deals just a little bit of comparability year-over-year and just a little bit of strength in the early part of the year in some of those parts of the business. And -- I should say, a handful of onetime items in there, but nothing related to the partnerships. Yes. I mean it implies 2% to 3% really for both quarters, Smedes. I think if you think about it, if you look at what's going on so far in the third quarter, it has been a touch softer. And as we get into the fourth quarter, the expectation would be as the bigger business travel months of October and the first part of November kick in, particularly in the U.S., that there would be a little bit of strengthening in RevPAR growth. As supported by -- also by, I should mention by our group position. So if you think about that and then if you think about the mix of the business, we still are largely 70% plus or minus of our revenue comes from the United States. And so what happens in the U.S. will be a driver, but supported by our group position supported by strength in the bigger group hotels in the urban markets, we think -- and what we think will be stronger business travel in the early part of the fourth quarter, that's kind of what's playing out over the balance sheet here. Yes. I mean, we didn't -- we haven't given a July run rate for us. But if you look at what's going on in the industry, it does imply an acceleration in the back half of the year relative to July, if that's your specific question. No, not yet. I think, look, it's sort of early days on sort of those changes. But I mean, really, in the end, that's about more transparency, and we do not see any impact to AV. We have not seen any impact nor do we expect any from that change. Yes, thanks for the question, Patrick. We appreciate that because we think it's been a very good story. We talked about this a little bit at the Investor Day, but for those who weren't there or need a reminder, we think there's 50 to 100 basis points a year of embedded margin growth increases in the business as we shift, obviously, the growth in the business is all through the fee segment. So those fees come in at 100% margin and improve the margins of the business. And so that, combined with really good cost control, which I think we have like Chris said earlier, I think we'll pat ourselves on the back a little bit on that. I think we're really good about being disciplined about cost control. And so what that's done is you can see our margins are 1,000 basis points higher than they were pre-COVID, and we think that, that will continue to grow. Again, there will be different there'll be puts and takes depending on what's going on in the economy and how we do and where we are relative to our annual algorithm projections. But for the most part, you should think about it as 50 to 100 basis points -- embedded growth. Yes. It's a really good question. I think it's obviously a bit of both. I mean we've had years in the past. This is the part of the cycle where particularly when capital gets more constrained and more expensive for new builds. And this is the part of the cycle where you typically lead into conversions because they're just easier to finance. You've got a trading hotel, you've got -- it's cash flowing. We are obviously leaning in to our lifestyle brands, which our soft brands tend to be more driven towards conversions. Spark is a 100% conversion brand. So we are doing things strategically to increase our share of conversion. So I think it's both. I think it's -- part of it's cyclical in nature. You said -- like I said, you've seen times when conversions have been a bigger part of the story. This is a part of that cycle. But some of these are like, I don't want to say permanent, but sort of semi-permanently we're doing things strategically to focus on being able to take share, and we're doing it. I think I think last year for the full year, we were something like 40% of the conversion deals done in the entire U.S. We're higher than that so far this year. And so our -- the network effect we create, the RevPAR next we drive the fact that our brands are stronger and the fact that we're strategically focusing on it, I think should mean that it's additive to the overall growth trajectory of the company over time rather than just being cyclical, but cyclicality matters as well. Yes. So I'll take the first part, I would say, on Spark, is everything is going the way we thought and the way it's planned. I mean, 95-plus percent of them are from third-party brands.

            "name": "Christopher Nassetta",
            "content": "Thank you. Jill good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report strong second quarter results with RevPAR growth driving adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high end of our guidance. We continued to execute on our successful development strategy and in July our system surpassed 8000 hotels globally. Our newly acquired brands and recent strategic partnerships will help us build even more loyalty with guests, further enhancing our network effect and increasing our industry leading RevPar premiums. Coupled with our asset light fee based business model, we are well positioned to continue producing significant free cash flow and driving meaningful shareholder returns in the quarter. In the quarter, system-wide, RevPAR increased 3.5% year-over-year above the midpoint of guidance due to robust group performance, continued recovery in business transient and easier holiday comparisons. Transient RevPAR grew 2% year-over-year with increases in both business and leisure demand. RevPAR across large corporates rose 5% in the quarter, driven by strong trends across most industries, including notable recover in technology. Leisure transient RevPAR continued to exceed prior peaks, supported by solid summer travel demand, particularly in international markets. Group RevPAR rose more than 10% year-over-year, led by strong demand for corporate and social meetings and events and booking windows continued to lengthen. For the full year group position is up 10% over last year, with position up mid-teens over the next several years. We expect full year system-wide RevPAR to increase 2% to 3% driven by positive growth across all major segments and regions. We tempered the high end of our expectations versus prior guidance due to softer trends in certain international markets and normalizing leisure growth more broadly. With continued strength in group and steady recovery in business transient, we expect higher end chain scales to continue to outperform. Turning to development in the quarter, we opened 165 hotels totaling more than 22,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 6.2%. We marked several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 6000th hotel in North America, and we surpassed 75,000 home two suites rooms globally. We also opened seven new resort properties in Europe, including the debut of Curio in Croatia and DoubleTree in Malta. We welcome graduate hotels and NoMad into our family of brands during the quarter, providing further opportunities to deliver exceptional guest experiences and accelerate our expansion in the fast growing lifestyle segment. Demand for lifestyle products continues to increase as guests seek unique experiences and sought after destinations around the world. In the last year, we have expanded our lifestyle offerings by more than 30%, fueled largely by growth in Curio, Tapestry and the recent acquisition of Graduate. With roughly 400 lifestyle properties today and hundreds more in the pipeline, we are well positioned for substantial growth over the next several years. Conversions accounted for roughly half of openings in the quarter, driven by the addition of Graduate and the continued strength from DoubleTree and Spark. In the quarter, Spark opened 27 hotels, more than doubling its existing supply. The brand also celebrated its debut in Europe with the opening of Spark by Hilton London Romford, just nine months after the first property opened in the U.S. The opening marks the start of an exciting journey for Spark to redefine the premium economy segment in Europe, with further launches of the brand across Continental Europe expected in the coming months. In the quarter, we signed 63,000 rooms, increasing our pipeline to approximately 508,000 rooms, which is up 8% from last quarter and 15% year-over-year, with notable strength across the EMEA and APAC regions. In particular, Hilton Garden Inn continued to gain tremendous traction with year-to-date signings, up nearly 90% across 20 different countries. Overall, conversions accounted for over half of the signings in the quarter, driven by additions from our acquisitions and partnerships. Excluding acquisitions and partnerships, conversions accounted for 25% of signings in the quarter, largely driven by continued momentum with Curio, Tapestry and DoubleTree. System-wide construction starts in the quarter were up 160% versus last year and up 37% excluding acquisitions and partnerships. With meaningful growth across both the U.S. and international markets, we remain on track to exceed prior peak levels of starts by year-end. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more than 20% of industry share and nearly four times our existing share of supply. We've seen tremendous interest from owners through our exclusive agreement with small luxury hotels of the world. With the pace of initial property signups far exceeding our expectations under our strategic partnership, we added nearly 300 boutique luxury properties to our system in July, with an additional 100 properties expected to join later this year. Adding these unique properties to our network is highly complementary to our existing luxury portfolio and significantly increases our luxury offerings for guests around the world without any capital commitment. During the quarter, the first AutoCamp properties were added to our platforms. Each AutoCamp location provides a unique opportunity for guests to immerse themselves in nature without sacrificing the comforts of high end accommodations. These exclusive agreements with SLH and AutoCamp provides Honors members with new and exciting ways to earn and redeem points while broadening and enhancing our network effect. As a result of our strong pipeline recent tuck-in acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we now expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5% for the full year. We are also proud to continue to be recognized for our industry leading brands and culture. Brand finance recently ranked Hilton as the most valuable hotel brand for the 9th consecutive year, claiming nine of the top 50 hotel brand spots. Additionally, Hilton was recently named the top workplace in the U.S. for millennials by Great Place to Work and Fortune for the 7th consecutive year. Since 2016, we've received over 540 recognitions as a Great Place to Work across more than 60 countries and we remain the number one great place to Work in the World and the United States. We're very happy with our second quarter results, development milestones and brand and commercial enhancements which we think demonstrate the continued strength of our business model. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the results in the quarter and our expectations for the year. Yes, I'd be happy to. I think the way to think about it is what's being added essentially is, is Graduate. I mean, if you look at our prior guidance, we had incorporated a guesstimate on what we would do for SLH. We are doing better than that. And so I think in the end that's going to probably be about a point and a half of NUG Graduate, which we said would be separate and apart is about a half a point. And so I think if you sort of unwind all that and compare it against prior guidance, the organic is slightly less, but has 100% to do with some things that are just moving from the fourth quarter into the, into the first quarter of next year. But as we were, as I said in my comments, in terms of feeling good about what's going on the development side, I mean, for the full year, we're going to hit historically high levels on signings. We're going to hit historically high levels on starts. And that is both of those, excluding any sort of partnerships or acquisitions. And obviously that's been translating into very good results. We feel very good about the momentum into next year. Most everybody was at our investor day in the spring where we articulated a sort of algorithm story of 6% to 7% organically. And we feel very, very good about being able to deliver on that. Obviously, this year is going to be above the higher end of that because of some of the inorganic things. But if we fast forward to next year, our expectation certainly is organically. We will be, we will be solidly in that range just given the signings, the starts and looking at how that's going to play out in the next couple of years. Yes. Well, last year was elevated because of a few very specific deals, which we've noted over the last couple of calls. This year will moderate and be lower than last year. And I think on a go-forward basis, I'd look at the next year as it sort of being comparable to where we'll end up this year. We're not really seeing any material difference. Notwithstanding a lot of noise in the market, I think in the quarter. Kevin helped me. We, our key money percentage of deals in second quarter was like 7% or 8%. Overall key money is still less than 10%. So 90 plus percent, fully free of any form of incentive. And we haven't really seen those stats really move around a whole lot. Again, we had an elevated year or two coming out of COVID because we got some really cool opportunities on some very big super high end luxury and sort of resort convention type assets. And we took advantage of that. But we're getting back to more normalized levels, which again will be lower than last year, this year. And I think we'll continue at that kind of level over the next two or three years. I don't have the exact number in my head, but I would guess at this point, for 2025, it's probably 40% to 50%. And for 2026, it's probably a quarter, something like that. By the end of the year, we'll be for 2025, we'll probably cross over at 60% to 70%. Those would be sort of the typical numbers. And group is sort of getting back to pre-COVID typical levels. Like, even if you look in the second quarter group mix, it was pretty much at where we were pre-COVID. I mean, of overall mix in Q2 was 20%, which is exactly what it was, pre-COVID. So it's sort of, Group it's taken a while because of the long lead nature of it and planning and all that goes into it, particularly with the larger groups and the citywides. But that, that's sort of, now hitting on all cylinders and normalizing. So, yes, I would think it'd be in those percentages. So I think it's a, they're a very good indicator if we sit around this very table, with all of our senior team, including head of sales and his team, and they feel very good. They're not. There's no sense of sort of slowing on demand and pricing, and the group demand, pricing and overall attitude in that segment remains quite good, quite strong. And as I mentioned in the comments, the booking window is extending. I mean, our overall booking window extended in the quarter. And at this point, pretty much the booking window is back to, obviously got super short during COVID but it's pretty much now back to normalized level extended in the second quarter and pretty much got us back to pre-COVID levels. The Group booking window continues to extend just because people have to go further out. There's just not enough space available for their needs. Good morning, Shaun. Yes, a great question. And obviously we spent a lot of time talking to people and looking at a lot of data in our business. Let me do it maybe through the lens of walking around the world a little bit to talk about what's going on. So starting with maybe I'll finish at home, start with Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific, as you heard in Kevin's commentary, is sort of a tale of two cities, China and then APAC ex-China. So in China, I think Kevin covered it nicely. In China, there is actually a very significant amount of travel going on. We do expect to end the year sort of down probably circa 5%. But what's going on in China is obviously they have economic issues, so their economy is slow, but really the travel business is still quite robust. But what's happening is they've opened up a lot of corridors for inter Asia travel that is visa free. And Chinese travelers love to travel and they're getting out of China and they're going around and there's just not enough inbound travel yet into China. There's not enough flights from Europe and the U.S. and other parts of the world to compensate for that, and that's going to take time. I mean, I was there during the quarter at a U.S. China travel summit that the State Department sponsored with their equivalent, and we were talking about, how we're going to get, stimulate more travel, more flights. And by the way, the flights have tripled or quadrupled, even since then. So, I mean, there is progress, but it's still going to take some time. So I think, China is a complex story, but that's what's going on. People, travel in aggregate similar to where it was sort of not better or worse, but more people leaving, not enough coming in. I suspect over the next year or two, we will get to a different place. Hopefully their economy start to pick up, but you'll have a lot more inbound travel. The rest of Asia Pacific quite strong, particularly led by Korea and Japan. And we haven't seen any real signs of weakening in those markets. And I should say India, for that matter. No real signs of weakening. And those are the real APAC ex-China markets that are driving performance. And then coming to EMEA, again, sort of a bit of a tale to cities. The Middle East remains quite strong pretty much across the board. Europe, I would say, is still very, very strong in an absolute sense, but a touch weaker than what we had seen a quarter ago, led by what you're talking, implied in your question, which is some of the leisure business. Again, you're still at the high end of high single digit sort of year-over-year growth. So it's not like it's a it's not a bad story. It's just a little it's come off just a little bit. And then coming, coming, I could keep lots of other places in the world, but these are the big markets. It's coming home to the U.S. is exactly what's implied and sort of what you would guess from what I've already said. If you break apart the segments, Group is still raging, business transient is still grinding up, not at a rapid pace, but still grinding up. Both of those segments maintaining great pricing power. And then leisure transient has been normalizing, because we're just getting back to a more normal life. And it was at very elevated levels, particularly on weekends, but broadly and so we continue to see sort of normalization there. And the consumer, if you break it apart, and sort of segments in the lower sort of half of consumers, maybe even the lower three quarters. I mean, you can read the data is all out there. They had bank accounts, and checking accounts full of money coming out of COVID. They've spent all that money. They're now borrowing more. And so, they have less available, less disposable income and capacity to do anything, including travel. You go up to the upper echelons and people still have pretty fat bank accounts and checking accounts and wherewithal. And so, what the impact of that is, some continued normalization on leisure transient. And the reason I use normalization is not to be cute. I mean, for the full year, if you look at it, we think we will globally see growth in all segments. I said that quickly in my prepared comments. It'll be very, very low in leisure transient, but positive a little bit, higher on business transient and then, very, very strong for the reasons I've described on meetings and events. So it is not, at least in our world and what we have seen year-to-date and what we expect for the rest of the year, it's not cratering in any way. It's just soft. It's but definitely softening for the reasons I described. Yes. I mean, being born to raise the control freak, nothing. I don't view anything is outside of some ability to have influence, not that maybe the broad macro, which we'll, I'm sure, talk more about at some point. So there are, David, a bunch of different things we can do. I'm not going to get into granular detail. But I mean you can see it in some of the actions that we publicly talk about like with our AmEx co-brand cards and the things that we're doing there to sort of reintroduce cards, change the benefits. And so I think I think the way you should look at it is, as Kevin described, we're in constant state of dialogue with all of our third-party partners on how to maximize these cards. We have a very serious seat at the table. We have lots of sort of contractual rights built into our relationship. But we also in the bulk of and particularly in our largest one with American Express have a long-standing and very close partnership. It's always in both of our interest to be making sure these things are performing. And so we both have dedicated teams in our companies, in the case of AmEx, we and they, but in our other partnerships that we have as well. And we have people literally grinding every day to figure out what or to figure out what the -- what we could do to modify the offer to customers to ultimately get them more to sign up in the case of co-brand and to enhance their desire to spend. We're in constant dialogue with like Hilton Grand Vacations. If you think about it, AmEx and HGV are probably the two biggest about the value proposition there. You can see in a very material way, we were deeply involved in the Bluegreen and Diamond acquisitions. Those were things that we worked on very closely with them to ultimately drive a much better outcome by effectively creating new brands within that space. So I can go on and on. The short answer is we don't leave anything for chance. I mean we're all over this stuff. We have rights, and we have great partnerships, and we are very aligned always trying to figure out how to modify programs and adjust the offers to customers to drive better outcomes. Yes. I mean I agree. -- that's why I feel good about being in the 6% to 7% range. I mean, effectively, if you take out all the partnerships and everything, it is by being solidly in that range, it is accelerating. So it is organically reflective of the strength conversions, we do think are accelerating. I mean, for the full year, we're going to have conversions over 50%. But again, that's in part driven by partnerships, acquisition and partnership. If you strip all of that stuff out conversions are going to go from like 30% to just under 40%. So we are having great success in conversions. We believe strongly that has everything to do with the strength of our brands and the strength of our commercial engines driving better outcomes for our owners. And so we are getting a hugely disproportionate share of conversions. And if we do our job, which we intend to do, we think that will continue. So being solidly in 6% to 7% next year, it is reflective of the benefit of the acceleration we're seeing in signing starts, conversions, all of that baked in. It's obviously a little bit early in that it's August to give the number -- to give a tighter range. But as we get closer to it, we will, but we feel very comfortable being solidly in that range. Yes. If you look at our guidance that is what is implied. I mean we -- the first part of the year in terms of -- I don't know what metric you're looking at. But if you just look at EBITDA growth, it will be higher in the first half of the year because of some of the stuff that Kevin was talking about on timing. As a result, it will be lower. But for the full year, it will be in the ranges we talked about, which when I rounded is sort of like EBITDA growth of 10%. I mean, I think -- and I'm patting us on the back, but I guess that's my job. I mean when I think about what's going on in the world and our ability to do that, I think it's striking. The reality is, as much as I said, I'm a control freak, and I wish we could control everything. We don't control the macro. You know that better than we do. And the macro environment is weakening a touch, okay? That's just what's going on, not dramatically so, but it's weakening a touch thus, why we brought the top end of our RevPAR guidance down and the top have shaved a little bit of the top end of our EBITDA guidance. Frankly, a lot of that shape had to do with FX changes honestly. If you take out FX, it didn't really move a whole lot from an EBITDA point of view. But even in the face of all that, at the same time that RevPAR, the midpoint of RevPAR is coming down, the midpoint of unit growth is going up, and the result is pretty much the same, which is if you think about back to Investor Day, we said we're going to deliver plus or minus 10% EBITDA growth on average, we're going to do it even in an environment that I would argue from a macro point of view is not super strong and softening a touch because of the success that we're having in executing what I think is a very thoughtful plan and strategy on the development side, we are still getting to circa 10% EBITDA growth in that environment. And I think that is a demonstration, both of the resilience of the core business and the model, and this is the pat us on the back, and I'm patting Kevin on the back as he runs this development, the success that we're having in what is a really good development strategy being super well executed. Good morning. Yes. I think your implication is right. Some of it is fees doing better in SLA. Some of it's non-RevPAR fees doing better. And the way to think about economics on SLH's we get sort of normal fees relative to what we would get a typical franchise arrangement. But for the fact that we get paid on the business we generate there versus 100% of revenues. Now recognize that the average rate of these hotels is probably 5 times to 7 times -- 6 times or 7 times our system-wide average rate. So in the end, we feel very good about the economics. And I think that acceleration, Kevin said this, Brant would be fourth quarter oriented. I think third quarter, you will likely see -- you're in a transition where leisure is softer and you don't have all the business travel and the meetings and events. So third quarter, if you look at it, third versus fourth. I think third quarter will be weaker, fourth quarter a lot stronger for the reasons Kevin described. One, we end -- we fully expect a more normalized business transient travel, particularly as you get a week or so past Labor Day. And in October, November, it will get cooking, and we have a very strong group base in the fourth quarter that supports a stronger fourth quarter than third. Good morning. And some years there'll be better somewhere. This is going to be a year that's best. So I think we will -- we expect to be over 100 basis points in EBITDA margin growth this year. No, I think we feel good about the second half in those regions that are really performing at that level. As I was trying to say when I did my little around the world exercise, we do think there's softening in certain segments, in certain parts of the world for the reasons I described. But not we think APAC ex-China is going to have a very good second half of the year. We think Middle East Africa will as well in those two cases. And those are the two that are really at the highest levels of RevPAR performance. And that was at our urging, with what we're strategically trying to do with Waldorf, if you think about all the existing Waldorf, the new [Indiscernible] that are coming. Waldorf is really hitting on all cylinders. The product is extraordinary. The new products are off the charts. And so there are like any brand that's been around for a while, there are some that really don't quite fit the bill. But the good news is with 24 brands, we have a home for -- not for everything, but we have a home for those things. And those properties that that left Walter are terrific properties that just weren't sort of meeting the mark on Waldorf, but they met the mark in other brands. We gave it -- it's in the press. 4,000 and change. Thank you, Chad, and thank you, as always, for spending an hour of your day with us. Obviously, we're super pleased with being able to deliver on second quarter, and we feel very good about our outlook for the full year, as I described, while the macro environment is a little bit weaker. Our development story is incrementally stronger and the net result is pretty much our ability to deliver an algorithm, which we're excited about. We will look forward to catching up with you after the third quarter to give you the latest and greatest. And hope everybody enjoys what you can on the rest of summer. Take care, and thanks."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin. \nJill Chapman: Thank you, MJ. Welcome to Hilton's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements.

Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our first quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.\n With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris. \nChristopher Nassetta: Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report strong first quarter results, which continue to demonstrate the power of our business model and the strength of our development story, both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS meaningfully exceeded the high end of our guidance even with RevPAR growth at the low end of our expected range. We also announced several new partnerships and additions to our brand portfolio, which will enable us to build even more loyalty with customers and help accelerate growth.\n Turning results for the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 2% year-over-year, which was at the low end of our guidance range as renovations, inclement weather and unfavorable holiday shifts weighed on results more than we anticipated. Leisure transient RevPAR exceeded our expectations even with tough year-over-year comparisons given continued strength in international markets and holiday shifts, business transient recovery remained steady with RevPAR across large corporates, up more than 3%, driven by strong demand in consulting and government contracting. Group RevPAR rose nearly 5% year-over-year, led by strong convention and social demand. Additionally, corporate groups continue to grow as a percentage of booking mix and booking windows continue to lengthen.\n As we look to the rest of the year, we continue to expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%, with the U.S. towards the low end of the range and continued strength in international markets. We expect positive RevPAR growth across all major segments, led by group performance at or above the high end of the range, business transient around the midpoint and leisure transient towards the lower end of the range. For the full year, group position is up 13% versus last year.\n Turning to development. We started the year off strong, building on the positive momentum from 2023. In the quarter, we opened more than 100 hotels totaling approximately 17,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.6%. Hotel openings span nearly all brands, demonstrating the strength and breadth of our industry-leading brand portfolio. Conversions accounted for 30% of openings, largely driven by DoubleTree and Spark. In the quarter, we celebrated the addition of a number of new luxury and lifestyle properties, including the debut of LXR in Hawaii, the introduction of the Waldorf and Canopy brands to the Seychelles and the highly anticipated opening of the Conrad Orlando.\n Located within the newly developed Evermore Orlando Resort complex, the Conrad Orlando features 5 distinct dining venues, an 8-acre lagoon and expansive pool complex, a world-class spa and extensive meeting and event space. We also achieved several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 800th hotel in Asia Pacific, our 225th hotel in the CALA region and reached 25,000 true rooms globally. Additionally, Hampton opened its 3,000th property worldwide. Since its launch 40 years ago, the Hampton brand has been a category leader with the largest global pipeline of any focused service brand and the recently announced new North American prototype. Hampton continues to demonstrate the strength of our legacy brands and the power of our innovative approach to brand evolution, we are confident that the best is yet to come for this iconic brand.\n In the quarter, we signed 30,000 rooms, increasing our pipeline to a record 472,000 rooms, up 2% from last quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Signings meaningfully outperformed our expectations driven by strength in international markets. In Asia Pacific, we signed agreements for 4 new Conrad properties, further strengthening our luxury pipeline. Globally, an interest in Hilton Garden Inn remained particularly strong with the brand achieving the highest quarter of signings in its history. System-wide construction starts also outperformed expectations, up roughly 45% versus last year, with all major regions meaningfully higher. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more than 20% of industry share and nearly 4x our share of existing supply.\n We also recently announced several exciting partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions, further accelerating our expansion into the fast-growing lifestyle and experiences categories. Earlier this month, we acquired a controlling interest in Sydell Group to expand the NoMad brand from its existing London flagship location to high-end markets all around the world. Our development teams are fully engaged and we have a great pipeline building. Additionally, we announced an agreement with AJ Capital to acquire the Graduate Hotels brand, a collection of over 30 lifestyle hotels in university anchored towns, each Graduate Hotel, steeped in local history charm and nostalgia and designed to reflect the unique character of its local university, offering the perfect setting for game-based graduations, reunions and campus visits.\n Graduate presents a unique opportunity to serve more guests, especially in markets where we're not present today. With thousands of colleges and universities around the world, we believe the addressable market for the brand is 400 to 500 hotels globally. For the rapidly increasing number of travelers looking to prioritize exploration and adventure, we recently announced an exclusive partnership with the premier outdoor hospitality company, AutoCamp. Stays will be bookable on Hilton's direct channels in the coming months, and we will offer our guests an experience that blends the spirit of an outdoor adventure with the hospitality and design forward nicking of a boutique hotel.\n Hilton Honors members will be able to earn and redeem points on stays and enjoy exclusive membership benefits while experiencing sought-after locations around the United States, including several properties adjacent to popular national parks. Along with our previously announced exclusive partnership with small luxury hotels of the world, these offerings provide incredible opportunities to further accelerate our growth and enhance our network effect by broadening and deepening our customer offerings in some of the industry's fastest-growing markets and segments. As a result of our strong pipeline and all the great progress we've seen to date for the full year, we expect net unit growth of 6% to 6.5%, excluding the planned addition of Graduate.\n To provide even more personalized experiences for our guests, we continue to leverage our industry-leading technology platforms from a digitally enabled concierge for our luxury brands, to the ability to choose your room from a floor plan and control your in-room entertainment from your mobile device. We continue to fully integrate the digital experience. Additionally, recent initiatives like add-ons Hilton for Business and improved search functionality are driving even greater conversion and higher revenue.\n We also continue to be recognized for our incredible workplace culture, Fortune and Great Place to Work recently named Hilton, the #1 on the list of best companies to work for in the United States, marking our ninth consecutive year on the list, and our sixth consecutive year in the top 10. In total, we won 20 Great Place to Work awards around the world with 5 #1 wins. These recognitions follow our ranking as the #1 world's best workplace and make Hilton the only hospitality company to have earned the top spot on these prestigious lists.\n Overall, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, and we expect our industry-leading brands, strong development story and powerful business model to continue to drive growth. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results for the quarter and our expectations for the full year. \nKevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by strong international performance and continued recovery in group.\n Adjusted EBITDA was $750 million in the first quarter, up 17% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth largely due to better-than-expected international RevPAR performance, license fee growth and timing items. Management and franchise fees grew 14% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.53.\n Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR was down 40 basis points year-over-year as renovations, holiday shifts and weather impacts dampened transient trends. Group performance remains strong. In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year with strong transient demand driving RevPAR growth of 10% in urban markets. In Europe, RevPAR grew 10% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments. A number of large events in the region drove strong group performance across several key cities. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 15% year-over-year, led by both rate and occupancy growth. Several prominent events, including the Asian Cup in Qatar and holidays in Saudi Arabia contributed to strong performance in the region.\n In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR was up 8% year-over-year, led by rate growth in Japan and Korea. China RevPAR was flat in the quarter with strong results in January and February, offset by difficult year-over-year comparisons in March. RevPAR in China's top cities increased 6% in the quarter, but an uptick in outbound travel pressured demand in secondary and tertiary markets, which benefited early in recovery from strong domestic travel.\n Turning to development. We ended the quarter with more than 472,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 10% year-over-year with approximately 60% of those rooms located outside the U.S. and nearly half of them under construction. Looking to the year ahead, we expect net unit growth of 6% to 6.5%, excluding the planned acquisition of Graduate Hotels.\n Moving to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $890 million and $910 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.80 and $1.86. For full year 2024, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA between $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.89 and $7.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases or any contribution from Graduate Hotels which we expect to close in the second quarter.\n Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the first quarter for a total of $39 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $900 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And for the full year, we expect to return approximately $3 billion. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings results we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks.\n We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. MJ, can we have our first question, please? \nOperator: Of course, the first question today comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. \nStephen Grambling: I just touch on the guidance in the first quarter. It seems like, clearly, some positive commentary in there. I just want to make sure I'm clear. I guess, when you put it all in the blender, if you will, what's really change in your mind as you look at the back half of the year and take into account what you've seen in the first quarter, both as it relates to development versus some of the deals you've made and then also what you're seeing on RevPAR. \nChristopher Nassetta: Sure. Happy to cover that. That's a broad array of topic so really -- really artful questions, Stephen. I would say when you flush it all out, obviously, and Kevin covered it in his prepared comments, the first quarter from a RevPAR point of view is a little bit lighter than we thought, but sort of easily explained on the basis of what Kevin already talked about. We had a lot more under construction than we had anticipated, which is a good thing, but not enough rooms out of inventory in a lot of those assets, particularly in our limited service brands to take it out of the comp set. So that weighed on is weather, definitely, we didn't anticipate what was going on -- what happened in the Northeast at the beginning of the year.\n And then while we certainly knew about the holiday shift of Easter moving in. It was a little more impactful and spring break sort of ended up being like a rolling 4 weeks of spring break. And so we underestimated that. As we think about the full year, the way to think -- the way I think about our outlook is the way I think most people are thinking about the broader economy, and that is the broader economy is reasonably strong. It seems to be very resilient. Obviously, employment numbers are quite good. Corporate profits, it depends on the industry, are still quite strong. And so as we sort of factor for that for the rest of the year and we think about the various segments, it leads us to feel about the way we did when we talked to you last time. Meaning if we look at the big segments, the group business is still incredibly strong. The demand is great. Every month that goes by, it's very strong. \n While the first quarter was certainly choppy because of the movement of the holiday and all that. When you talk to customers, which we do all the time and I do, I think you get a very positive view about there are people traveling more for business transient. And because the economy has been resilient and employment has been strong, I think it helps with the underpinning, while leisure certainly is normalizing from super high levels. It gives you, I think, a reasonable amount of confidence that it's still going to be relatively strong, modest growth, mostly in the form of rate because we continue to have a decent amount of pricing power. And so when you sort of like put that all in the gonculator and spit it out at the end of the day, from a RevPAR from a top line point of view, that's why we maintained our guidance. First quarter, a little bit more choppy, but the reality is some of that reverses because of the holiday shift, we'll get the benefit in the second quarter, and we feel about the same based on a pretty consistent consensus view that the economy is going to maintain relative strength.\n On the development side, between Kevin's and my comments, you heard, I mean, we feel like we have a lot of momentum. I said it on the last call, that I think we were on the slope up. And I said -- and we said it at our Investor Day that over the next few years, we think we'll be at 6% to 7% in NUG, that's where we think we're going to be and the reality is we had strong expectations carrying over momentum from the end of the year, but it was better in terms of signings and starts and openings, frankly, that a little bit than we thought. And so as we look at the year and we look around the world and work with our development teams. I mean the reality is we think we're going to sign more deals than we've ever signed, and we're going to start more deals and more hotels under construction than we're going to sign. That obviously is helped by conversions, but it's also new development. I mean if you look at the new development versus conversions, they're both up in sort of the low teens.\n So there's a lot of momentum. What's driving that? Of course, we think people have a lot of interest in our brands because of their best-performing brands. But if you look at the broader system because of the relative strength of this economy and many other economies around the world, people are largely very profitable. And as a result of being very profitable in their existing portfolio, their desire is to continue to expand their businesses. And so we feel very, very good about what's going on. The financing environment. I'll leave some other things for maybe other questions I can keep going. But that's sort of both from a revenue top line point of view and a little bit of color on both and unit growth to give you a sense of how we think about the outlook for the year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. \nJoseph Greff: Chris, just kind of going back to your comments on how you're viewing the balance of this year. You mentioned all 3 major segments you would expect to be degrees of up year-over-year from a RevPAR growth perspective. If you were to bifurcate it between the full-service chain scale segments and the select service chain scale segments, would you expect the lower-end chain scale segments to be positive year-over-year? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes, modestly. I mean we think they will be lower in performance, but we think our forecasting and outlook is they will be positive but modestly so. And those were impacted in the first quarter by the things -- more dramatically by the things that I described. And by the way, comparability because the first -- if you look broadly in the first quarter over the last year, from the standpoint of how we perform relative to the industry overall, we had a much better performance than the industry, and that was really driven by the select service brands. And so they have lapped in the first quarter over very, very difficult comps. That gets easier, pretty difficult comps in Q2 for the record as well, but we think that gets much easier in the second half of the year from a comp issue. And so our expectation is they would be positive but lower than other higher chain scales. \nOperator: The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. \nRobin Farley: Great. I wonder if you could kind of remind us where we are. You talked about the Group being up -- position up 13% year-over-year, but where we are with Group and business transient relative to 2019? And then I kind of have a part 2 of the question, which is just when we look at the broader FTR trends and occupancy in the U.S. has been down for -- depending on how you measure a month there from sort of 7 to 12 months with all the RevPAR coming from rate increase. And just wondering in your long experience looking at trends over the years, does that worry you at all that occupancy is down even with, I think, not getting back to 2019 levels yet and kind of what that might mean for rate and RevPAR later in the year? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Taking one at a time. In terms of Group and BT versus '19, they are both eclipsing from a revenue point of view, but from a demand occupancy point of view, they're both below business transient modestly, pretty minor. Group a little bit more so, I think, like 500 basis points or something like that is from memory. They can, in fact, check me. And that has -- so let me cover in reverse order business transient is, I mean Group is just a function of gestation period for this to ramp up. I think by the time you get to the second half of the year, and certainly, by the end of the year, Group demand will be finally back to where -- just based on the underlying strength in that space.\n Business transient, as I said, is a little bit off. If you break it down between small, medium businesses versus the big corporates, the small, medium businesses are already demand-wise over, and the big corporates are under. But as you saw, we had pretty big growth relative to a quarter that wasn't a lot of -- was more leisure-oriented because of the holiday shift in big corporates, and that's what we're hearing from our big corporate customers as they're traveling more. So that is coming back. Their balance sheets are strong. Earnings are still -- maybe they're going up at a lower rate or whatever, but they're still relatively strong.\n And so our expectation is by the end of the year from a demand point of view, we think there's an awfully good chance that BT will get there, too, just with continued growth in the big corporates in very resilient SMB business. And that's sort of how we've baked our outlook. In terms of occupancy and rate, that sort of answers the question then because we think you are continuing to build occupancy through the rest of the year. I think you got to be really careful in the first quarter. The first quarter is super messy with the things that we've talked about going on. It's really hard to like glean much from that.\n But if you look at the Group trends, they are really strong, as I said, and that provides a tremendous platform to yield manage that we really haven't had in the way that we're starting to have. And if you agree with the sort of the underpinnings of business transient and occupancies are not raging up but are sort of grinding up. Again, that gives you a pretty good setup for some modest occupancy gains. Those are going to come in BT and Group, not in Leisure. In fact, you could have slight occupancy declines in Leisure, but I think in the core of the more days of the week than not, you're building more pricing power, which I think allows you to continue to have the ability to push rate. \nOperator: The next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. \nShaun Kelley: Chris, just hoping we could get a little bit more color on sort of the regions. You gave some in the prepared remarks, but specifically, to dig in U.S. at the lower end of the range. So I think we've talked a little bit about what could get that coming. But anything you're seeing on April there in terms of some of the shift back from Easter. And then I think more importantly, you called out some strength elsewhere, Europe, Japan. Could you dig in a little bit there? And specifically on China, just flattish, the exit rate wasn't that great. What needs to happen there one way or another to impact Hilton? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Thanks. I'm going to ask Kevin to take that. \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Shaun, I'll take this one. I think, yes, in the U.S., we're seeing so far is in line with our expectations, right? The Easter calendar shift is flipping back the way we thought April is in line with what we thought. And so if you think about our 2% to 4% guide for the whole company, I think the U.S. will be at the lower end of that range, but I think you'll see the U.S. go back to positive I think around the rest of the world, I said it in my prepared remarks, but Europe remains really resilient, up 10% in the quarter. There's a lot of noise in the economy in various European economies and war and whatever else is going on, it still seems to push through, and we still seem to get pretty good performance. APAC, the same thing.\n Now China we said was flattish for the quarter. We think it will be about the same for the year. And what's happening there is what we said in our prepared remarks is that you had a lot of resilience coming out of the pandemic with domestic travel really fueling strong demand growth there. And now people are starting to move outside of the country because they can. And the urban markets in China are performing really well. The secondary tertiary markets are feeling the effects a little bit of people leaving the country and we think that will continue for the balance of the year. And I think you asked what you need to have that change is you need to have more inbound into China, particularly from other parts of Asia Pacific and then you need to see people from other parts of the world starting to come inbound to China to create that incremental demand that will enable us to yield rate and have that start to grow again. \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. The other thing -- I think that's all perfect, I would add on relative to China is we are also, while people aren't coming into China, we are starting to see that shift. There are a lot more flights that are going to start in the second and third quarter that are going to be going from major destinations, including the United States into China, which is going to help. But we are also seeing is the Chinese customer and as much as we think will sort of be flattish this year because there was a huge surge in Chinese were staying in China and traveling all over China, and now they're leaving. We are a net beneficiary of that and other parts of Asia.\n So if you look at our Southeast Asia business, our Japanese business, I mean, they are largely predominantly staying into Asia at the moment. I think that's going to change as more flights open up. And so we're getting -- well, China is not surging in the sense we talk about, we are seeing other markets, particularly Southeast Asia and Japan that are huge beneficiaries of that migration. \nOperator: The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. \nCarlo Santarelli: Kevin, I know you touched on it in your prepared remarks a little bit, but specifically on the base and other fees, I think they were up about 32% year-over-year, a dramatic acceleration. In terms of the things you mentioned, I would assume some of that is international, but any way you could provide a little bit more color on the drivers there? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. I mean, part of it is, as you said, it's a mix. I mean, in parts of the world where we have more managed hotels is driving more management fees and incentive management fees. We had good performance in license fees, as we mentioned, were up ahead of the broader business. And then our purchasing business has been really strong as it continues to grow. And that you see showing up in other -- that business has continued to take share even outside of our system, it continues to take rate, and it's performing really well. So that's been a positive driver there as well. \nOperator: The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. \nDavid Katz: With respect to net unit growth, I know you said previously that the acquired entities may add 25 or 50 basis points. Can you just sort of paint us a longer-term picture of how the addition of those should roll into your NUG. Is that sort of included Chris, when you say 6% plus. How should we think about those brands in the context of that? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean we did say last time that we were going to incorporate SLH into it, and that is incorporated into our 6% to 6.5%. We ultimately will add in Graduate, but just we think the better convention is to add both the EBITDA and earnings impact and the net NUG impact once closed so that is not in that. I think the way to think about it going forward is the SLH is going to be probably coming into our system over the next couple of years. It's early days, but so far, we really like what we're seeing. We're getting a very, very high percentage of existing SLH members in the markets that we have been out and with SLH marketing to sign up and want to come into the system. And we have no reason to believe that won't continue, getting the technology and all that done, which is people are working on both sides very, very diligently on. We'll start to get us to the other side and incorporating assets and the ability for our customers to book through our channels and honors, earn and burn and all of that, sometime probably middle or late summer so I mean, it's a little bit of a moving feast.\n But the 6% to 6.5% does incorporate what we said last time. It's probably 1/4 to 0.5 point is the way to think about that consistent with what we said last time. And there'll be more next year built into that. And my guess is as we grow that business with them, it will continue to contribute probably at a lesser degree just because we'll get the bulk of the system in over this year and next. Graduate will be kind of a onetime thing. And as we said at our Investor Day, we believe -- and we don't have -- I said there, we had one other thing we were working on. We announced one thing since then. We don't -- I don't think you should expect that you're going to see any additions to NUG in that arena.\n Now I'm going to say because I always do, never say never. I've been saying that for the many years I've been running the company, but we don't have any other of those sorts of tricks up our sleeve anytime soon. So I think the way to think about our guidance of 6% to 7% over the next few years is there'll be a onetime sort of thing for Graduate, but it's otherwise organic in the way it's always been. \nOperator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. \nBennett Rose: I just noticed that the percent of the pipeline under construction just ticked up a little bit from fourth quarter and first quarter. I was just wondering, is that concentrated in the U.S. and could you just maybe talk a little bit about what developers are seeing in terms of getting properties out of the ground on the financing front or getting the supplies of the workers they need. Just any color along there? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. I mean I think the percentage under construction is from both. I don't have the breakdown right in front of me, but it's definitely from both and then somewhat driven by slightly higher. We've been talking about a slightly higher percentage of conversions. So those go under construction more quickly. And so as you do those, it moves the percentage of the pipeline that's under construction a little bit. I think in terms of the atmospherics, I think, look, you hear -- we all hear from a lot of developers, you probably talk to developers. It's still challenging the labor cost side of it and the raw materials cost side of it, those dramatic increases that we saw during COVID have leveled off. So that's a good news story.\n Capital remains more expensive, although I think important to note that it's a little bit less expensive than it would have been sort of end of last year or over the course of last year. So I think you're still seeing better developers and the better projects are getting financed. It's a good new story broadly across the industry, fewer things are coming out of the ground, but we're taking share. So we have higher quality brands that are more easily financeable. So more of our projects are getting done and coming out of the ground. It's just sort of at a slightly slower rate. But like as we said in our prepared remarks, and Chris mentioned in some of the Q&A, we think our starts are going to eclipse prior peaks this year, they're going to be obviously up year-over-year. And so we're getting enough done to keep momentum, but it's still a little bit tough out there in terms of financing. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. \nBrandt Montour: And maybe for Kevin. Kevin, you mentioned timing items. If you could just elaborate on that and sort of what and where and when we should expect any of that to reverse, please? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I mean timing will be -- it will largely reverse in the second quarter. It's not huge. It's sort of $5 million to $10 million of timing items in the first quarter. And then to sort of just finish the story at the risk of doing modeling live on the call. But we did increase our guidance at the midpoint by $45 million, but that has a headwind -- an incremental headwind in and of about $10 million to $15 million, closer to $15 million of FX over the course of the year. So we did, in fact, carry through a little bit more than the beat in terms of our outlook for the year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. \nChad Beynon: Wanted to ask about Group beyond '24. Is this continuing to build in terms of multiyear commitments? Maybe just kind of a stat in terms of what you're seeing on the books for '25 at this point versus what you historically have seen during these periods? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I don't have the data point in my head, but I do know this. Yes, it's building for '25, '26. I believe both years are sort of high single, low double-digit increases relative to where we've been in the past. So yes, I mean, they're putting the data in front of me. So my memory is right, 13% and 15% up in '25 and '26. \nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist. \nCharles Scholes: On the NoMad news, that's a pretty small change at the moment. What are your plans for that? Where do you see that brand going in the next 5 years? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes. Look, we think it will -- it is a very strong brand. There's a reason why we wanted to partner with them/controlling interest in that company. It is small today, but it's been a little bit bigger over time, such a well-known brand in the community. And we think that brand will compete really effectively combined with our engines and the strength of our system, compete really effectively with the other luxury lifestyle brands that are out there, and we think it can be upwards of 100 hotels over time. And so most of those will be -- there'll be some conversions, but a lot of them will be new build. So it will be a little bit longer burn, and it's a little bit smaller segment than some of our other scale brands, but we think it will fit in nicely and contribute positively to our NUG over time. \nChristopher Nassetta: And what we really love about it is we did as I've talked about, it seems like time and eternity, luxury lifestyle. We did a huge amount of work because one of the options was to do this on our own, which you know we are pretty good at and like to do historically. And as we did the work over the last bunch of years, sort of like because this is always benefit in the skunk works, and I'm not exaggerating, this is sort of the ethos of what Andrew Zobler and his team have created a sort of bull's-eye for what we think is modern luxury lifestyle today and going forward in terms of what customers are looking for.\n And so it was a very efficient way for us to get in the space, accelerate our entry in the space, meaning take -- let's be honest, multiple years because they already have a pipeline, let alone what we're adding to it. And importantly, with Andrew and his team be able to effectively acquire a really talented team of people that are very steeped in the luxury lifestyle space. So we think it was sort of the trifecta. It hit every button for us in terms of making sense. But yes, it's very small. But hey, the good news is it's very small, we didn't pay a whole lot for it, and that means great organic growth going forward. \nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate it. Just coming back to the fee rate growth, if we just look at fees as a percentage of total room rev. Can you speak to what drives seasonality, if anything, on this percentage. And in terms of the year-over-year improvement, you showed nice improvement here in the first quarter. Can we hold on to that as we progress through the year? Or is it lumpy? \nKevin Jacobs: Sorry, Duane, I didn't quite catch the first part of your question. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just the fee rate growth, which you showed nice improvement on year-over-year total fees as a percentage of room rev, is there seasonality on that percentage? And if so, what drives it? In other words, you made nice progress here in the first quarter. It's one of the concepts you talked about in your Investor Day is sort of raising royalty fees, et cetera. Is there anything specific to the first quarter that's kind of nonrecurring? Or can we hold on to that improvement as we progress through the year? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, I think it's a bit of both without getting into too much detail. There was a touch of the timing was in fees, but a lot of it is strength. And like I said earlier in one of my answers, in the parts of the world where our managed business is bigger and the segments in the U.S. with urban hotels where our managed business is bigger, we think incentive management fees will continue to be a strong contributor over the course of the year, and that's sort of all baked into our guidance. So no anomalies in there. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. \nMichael Bellisario: Two parts for you on loyalty. Just first, what was Honors occupancy in the quarter? And then bigger picture. Just aside from offering customers more options, how are you driving how are you thinking about incremental engagement? I know you're still having to educate travelers about loyalty and the benefit of loyalty, especially compared to all the book direct and marketing campaigns you had to do pre-pandemic? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. Honors occupancy was, I think, at our historical high 64% and change up like 300 to something -- a little over 300 basis points year-over-year. And so Honors is working. Our customers are engaged more than I think any other program that is out in the industry. We do have a bunch of things that we are doing. Some of them you've seen that are -- what we're doing with SLH, what we're doing with AutoCamp, you should expect to see more not like Graduate type things, but more partnerships particularly in the experiential area. I think I talked about it on the last call so more AutoCamps, I think areas like safaris and yachts and other riverboat cruises and other things because we know that our customers -- those are adjunct sort of travel experiences that connect to our business that gives our base of customers, incremental things to engage with us that they want to do and is not in conflict in any way with our business, but we think is synergistic.\n And so there are a bunch of other things that we're doing that. But in reality, our expectation, while we, I think, to lead the industry, I know we do at 64%. We have aspirations as we talked about at Investor Day, to be really at 75%, maybe over time, even higher. And that's a very -- I'm not going to get into the details of it for a whole bunch of competitive reasons. But that is that is not 1 or 2 things. That's a series of strategies broadly for Honors, some of which I just talked about, further opportunities to keep customers engaged in other ways that are new and different and appealing to them.\n But it's also a significant amount of work that creates a more bespoke offering in certain major regions of the world, I think Asia Pacific, particularly China and other parts of the world where loyalty is a big deal, but what appeals to that customer base may be a little bit different than what might appeal to a customer base here in the United States. And so there's -- again, there are a whole bunch of different things that we are going to do. So I think you should have an expectation you'll continue to see that Honors occupancy go up as a result of greater engagement. Obviously, that is our lowest cost distribution channel. And so that's good for us and very good for our owners that it helps drive incremental market share gains and does it on a very cost-efficient basis. But I'm not going to get into granular strategies within Honors in this format or any format for that matter other than with our customers. \nOperator: The next question is from Bill Crow with Raymond James. \nWilliam Crow: Two parter here, Chris. First, how much risk do you think exists? Or are you seeing any signs that the weaker demand we're seeing at the low end of the chain scale could migrate upward as the Feds hire for longer stance persists? And the second part is simply third quarter, how much impact do you anticipate from the Olympics, if any, on overall results? \nChristopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean we do think the Olympics will be a nice positive for Europe broadly and obviously, for Paris and France. I mean our -- it's not going to dramatically impact our numbers just because Europe is a pretty big part of our portfolio. But if you look at France, while we're present in a lot of markets in France. We're not -- it's not a large portion of our portfolio. So it will be great, and it will help, but it's not going to help as much as if it was in New York City or summer where we had a huge density hotels.\n In terms of the first question, which I think is a really good question. And I think, listen, it deserves a good answer, and I'll give you the best I got. The best I got is who said it George H. W. Bush, it's the economy, stupid, I think. I'm not calling you stupid Bill, for the record. But it has everything to do with the economy. I mean the reality is, as I said in my comments, our outlook is based on a pretty -- not just consensus view, but a strong consensus view that the economy is going to be growing at a decent rate and employment is going to stay pretty strong. \n Obviously, higher for longer is the Fed's way of trying to like tamp things down. But there's no question in my mind, you can have your own view. Everybody can that the Fed is trying to orchestrate a soft landing. So far, it feels like they have been able to do it.\n Our outlook with the U.S. being at the low end of our guidance ranges sort of anticipate that consensus view, which is a soft landing, which means the economy is more resilient than people thought but broadly as the year goes on, softening because that's what the Fed is trying to do. And we have tried to sort of factor for all of that in our guidance. And so whether it's the upper end, lower end or wherever it is, I think it has everything to do with a broader economy. The good news for us is the median income of our core customer, like our lower member is high, it's $150,000 median income where the Fed where you look at the data out of the credit card companies and the retailers, it's like $100,000 and below is where you see people stretched and credit card balances, bank accounts running out and credit card balances going up. When you get up into the $150,000, the data still looks really good in terms of people have a lot of money in the bank and they have enough disposable income. \n And as I said, businesses, company, corporate America is still relatively strong. So I think of the economy, if they -- I think this range and outcome that we've given and sort of where the U.S. we think will flush out is based on the consensus view that we will have some slowing but a soft landing and positive economic growth. \nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. \nRichard Clarke: In the quarter versus 2019, it looks like U.S. occupancy is still 450 basis points where you were pre-COVID. Obviously, there's some seasonality in there but that doesn't seem to get you anywhere near that. Is it just now a matter of time to get that occupancy back or can we now think that maybe there has been some structural shift in travel that means kind of... \nChristopher Nassetta: I think you answered it, large. That has more to do with seasonality than anything. And the calendar shift because remember, Leisure is sort of 25% or 30% of our business and because of the calendar -- because of the holiday shift, it ended up being a big leisure quarter, which meant Leisure was good, but the reality is then 70%, 75% of the business was not. And so I think it's a seasonal plus the compounding impact of the movement of the holiday. So I do think -- I mean, listen, we sort of got -- we got pretty close in December. So I mean, by the fourth quarter of last year, we were pretty tight on 2019 levels. \nOperator: The next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. \nConor Cunningham: Could you just talk a little bit about the competition for conversions? Where things are most intense and where regions or areas that you're having more success? You obviously did really well in the first quarter, I think you said 30% of your makeup of the new development was there. Just any thoughts there on competition? \nKevin Jacobs: Yes, Conor. It sort of depends on -- it's sort of a little bit deal dependent, right? Sometimes it often depends on which flags are available in that particular market. It depends on where you are at the upper end in luxury, there's a lot more competition because there's just more brands. And then when you get into the sort of the middle tiers and below, there's us and a couple of others that -- not to be competitive that sort of maybe fight for second place when we're not available. So yes, we do really well. I think for the full year last year, in the U.S., we did 40% of all conversion deals that were done in the U.S. \n So we take a lot of share. We're doing really well. We've talked about Spark is going to be really disruptive in terms of your bringing a brand to a segment that we haven't been in before. So you're combining the strength of our engines with a brand that's sort of new and innovative and can be really disruptive in that space. But that's not the only place we're being successful. We're being successful all over the world. I think we mentioned DoubleTree in our prepared remarks. Our soft brands are gaining momentum, Curio, Tapestry, LXR, so it really -- I'm rambling a little bit. It really does depend on the deal in terms of who shows up and we're competitive with. But I think the good news is when our flags are available, if you can mine our engines with the quality of our brands, we're always right there at the top of the list for developers. \nOperator: The next question is from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. \nDaniel Politzer: Europe seems like it's certainly a bright spot within your portfolio. Can you maybe even outside the Olympics for the rest of the year, could you maybe frame where you're seeing that demand? Is it on the business or leisure side? Is it kind of the higher chain scales or middle tier? Any additional detail there would be helpful. \nKevin Jacobs: Yes. I think it's really across the board. They're seeing the same dynamics. The Group demand is strong, business, Leisure, particularly with the strength of the dollar that sort of buys more for leisure travelers going over there, it's really been across the board. \nOperator: The next question is from Ben Chaiken with Mizuho. \nBenjamin Chaiken: Great flow-through on revenue to EBITDA in 1Q. That's in the context of what sounds like some calendar headwinds. Anything you would call out as a tailwind or a comp dynamic or just good blocking and tackling. If I heard correctly, I believe you mentioned there was a $10 million good guy in 1Q that I believe reverses in 2Q? Just anything you could call out as we progress through the year? \nChristopher Nassetta: A little bit, but I think it's good blocking and tackling. And we -- our flow-through of revenue to EBITDA, we think, is consistent with what we've been saying and outlining 50 -- low 50s and what we described at Investor Day. So Q1 is, I think, a good demonstration of great discipline in running the business even when top line was a little bit lighter than what we had hoped for. \nKevin Jacobs: Yes. And again, I think I said this before, but when it comes from fees, right, I mean, that's obviously our highest margin business. And so an incremental dollar of fees and IMF drops straight to the bottom line. So when the strength comes from the fee segment, which probably will continue to because that's our largest segment and our fastest-growing segment, you're going to continue to see better flow-through and margin growth. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional closing remarks. \nChristopher Nassetta: Thanks, everybody. As always, we appreciate you dedicating this much time as we've described. We feel good about the business, good about momentum, good about where broadly economies are to deliver the results that we've talked about and super good about the momentum we have on the development side. And we will look forward to talking to you this summer after we complete Q2. Thanks again and talk soon. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by strong international performance and continued recovery in group.\n Adjusted EBITDA was $750 million in the first quarter, up 17% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth largely due to better-than-expected international RevPAR performance, license fee growth and timing items. Management and franchise fees grew 14% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.53.\n Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR was down 40 basis points year-over-year as renovations, holiday shifts and weather impacts dampened transient trends. Group performance remains strong. In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year with strong transient demand driving RevPAR growth of 10% in urban markets. In Europe, RevPAR grew 10% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments. A number of large events in the region drove strong group performance across several key cities. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 15% year-over-year, led by both rate and occupancy growth. Several prominent events, including the Asian Cup in Qatar and holidays in Saudi Arabia contributed to strong performance in the region.\n In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR was up 8% year-over-year, led by rate growth in Japan and Korea. China RevPAR was flat in the quarter with strong results in January and February, offset by difficult year-over-year comparisons in March. RevPAR in China's top cities increased 6% in the quarter, but an uptick in outbound travel pressured demand in secondary and tertiary markets, which benefited early in recovery from strong domestic travel.\n Turning to development. We ended the quarter with more than 472,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 10% year-over-year with approximately 60% of those rooms located outside the U.S. and nearly half of them under construction. Looking to the year ahead, we expect net unit growth of 6% to 6.5%, excluding the planned acquisition of Graduate Hotels.\n Moving to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $890 million and $910 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.80 and $1.86. For full year 2024, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA between $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.89 and $7.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases or any contribution from Graduate Hotels which we expect to close in the second quarter.\n Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the first quarter for a total of $39 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $900 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And for the full year, we expect to return approximately $3 billion. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings results we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks.\n We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. MJ, can we have our first question, please? Yes, Shaun, I'll take this one. I think, yes, in the U.S., we're seeing so far is in line with our expectations, right? The Easter calendar shift is flipping back the way we thought April is in line with what we thought. And so if you think about our 2% to 4% guide for the whole company, I think the U.S. will be at the lower end of that range, but I think you'll see the U.S. go back to positive I think around the rest of the world, I said it in my prepared remarks, but Europe remains really resilient, up 10% in the quarter. There's a lot of noise in the economy in various European economies and war and whatever else is going on, it still seems to push through, and we still seem to get pretty good performance. APAC, the same thing.\n Now China we said was flattish for the quarter. We think it will be about the same for the year. And what's happening there is what we said in our prepared remarks is that you had a lot of resilience coming out of the pandemic with domestic travel really fueling strong demand growth there. And now people are starting to move outside of the country because they can. And the urban markets in China are performing really well. The secondary tertiary markets are feeling the effects a little bit of people leaving the country and we think that will continue for the balance of the year. And I think you asked what you need to have that change is you need to have more inbound into China, particularly from other parts of Asia Pacific and then you need to see people from other parts of the world starting to come inbound to China to create that incremental demand that will enable us to yield rate and have that start to grow again. Yes, sure. I mean, part of it is, as you said, it's a mix. I mean, in parts of the world where we have more managed hotels is driving more management fees and incentive management fees. We had good performance in license fees, as we mentioned, were up ahead of the broader business. And then our purchasing business has been really strong as it continues to grow. And that you see showing up in other -- that business has continued to take share even outside of our system, it continues to take rate, and it's performing really well. So that's been a positive driver there as well. Yes, sure. I mean I think the percentage under construction is from both. I don't have the breakdown right in front of me, but it's definitely from both and then somewhat driven by slightly higher. We've been talking about a slightly higher percentage of conversions. So those go under construction more quickly. And so as you do those, it moves the percentage of the pipeline that's under construction a little bit. I think in terms of the atmospherics, I think, look, you hear -- we all hear from a lot of developers, you probably talk to developers. It's still challenging the labor cost side of it and the raw materials cost side of it, those dramatic increases that we saw during COVID have leveled off. So that's a good news story.\n Capital remains more expensive, although I think important to note that it's a little bit less expensive than it would have been sort of end of last year or over the course of last year. So I think you're still seeing better developers and the better projects are getting financed. It's a good new story broadly across the industry, fewer things are coming out of the ground, but we're taking share. So we have higher quality brands that are more easily financeable. So more of our projects are getting done and coming out of the ground. It's just sort of at a slightly slower rate. But like as we said in our prepared remarks, and Chris mentioned in some of the Q&A, we think our starts are going to eclipse prior peaks this year, they're going to be obviously up year-over-year. And so we're getting enough done to keep momentum, but it's still a little bit tough out there in terms of financing. Yes. I mean timing will be -- it will largely reverse in the second quarter. It's not huge. It's sort of $5 million to $10 million of timing items in the first quarter. And then to sort of just finish the story at the risk of doing modeling live on the call. But we did increase our guidance at the midpoint by $45 million, but that has a headwind -- an incremental headwind in and of about $10 million to $15 million, closer to $15 million of FX over the course of the year. So we did, in fact, carry through a little bit more than the beat in terms of our outlook for the year. Yes. Look, we think it will -- it is a very strong brand. There's a reason why we wanted to partner with them/controlling interest in that company. It is small today, but it's been a little bit bigger over time, such a well-known brand in the community. And we think that brand will compete really effectively combined with our engines and the strength of our system, compete really effectively with the other luxury lifestyle brands that are out there, and we think it can be upwards of 100 hotels over time. And so most of those will be -- there'll be some conversions, but a lot of them will be new build. So it will be a little bit longer burn, and it's a little bit smaller segment than some of our other scale brands, but we think it will fit in nicely and contribute positively to our NUG over time. Sorry, Duane, I didn't quite catch the first part of your question. Yes, I think it's a bit of both without getting into too much detail. There was a touch of the timing was in fees, but a lot of it is strength. And like I said earlier in one of my answers, in the parts of the world where our managed business is bigger and the segments in the U.S. with urban hotels where our managed business is bigger, we think incentive management fees will continue to be a strong contributor over the course of the year, and that's sort of all baked into our guidance. So no anomalies in there. Yes, Conor. It sort of depends on -- it's sort of a little bit deal dependent, right? Sometimes it often depends on which flags are available in that particular market. It depends on where you are at the upper end in luxury, there's a lot more competition because there's just more brands. And then when you get into the sort of the middle tiers and below, there's us and a couple of others that -- not to be competitive that sort of maybe fight for second place when we're not available. So yes, we do really well. I think for the full year last year, in the U.S., we did 40% of all conversion deals that were done in the U.S. \n So we take a lot of share. We're doing really well. We've talked about Spark is going to be really disruptive in terms of your bringing a brand to a segment that we haven't been in before. So you're combining the strength of our engines with a brand that's sort of new and innovative and can be really disruptive in that space. But that's not the only place we're being successful. We're being successful all over the world. I think we mentioned DoubleTree in our prepared remarks. Our soft brands are gaining momentum, Curio, Tapestry, LXR, so it really -- I'm rambling a little bit. It really does depend on the deal in terms of who shows up and we're competitive with. But I think the good news is when our flags are available, if you can mine our engines with the quality of our brands, we're always right there at the top of the list for developers. Yes. I think it's really across the board. They're seeing the same dynamics. The Group demand is strong, business, Leisure, particularly with the strength of the dollar that sort of buys more for leisure travelers going over there, it's really been across the board. Yes. And again, I think I said this before, but when it comes from fees, right, I mean, that's obviously our highest margin business. And so an incremental dollar of fees and IMF drops straight to the bottom line. So when the strength comes from the fee segment, which probably will continue to because that's our largest segment and our fastest-growing segment, you're going to continue to see better flow-through and margin growth."

            "content": "Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report strong first quarter results, which continue to demonstrate the power of our business model and the strength of our development story, both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS meaningfully exceeded the high end of our guidance even with RevPAR growth at the low end of our expected range. We also announced several new partnerships and additions to our brand portfolio, which will enable us to build even more loyalty with customers and help accelerate growth.\n Turning results for the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 2% year-over-year, which was at the low end of our guidance range as renovations, inclement weather and unfavorable holiday shifts weighed on results more than we anticipated. Leisure transient RevPAR exceeded our expectations even with tough year-over-year comparisons given continued strength in international markets and holiday shifts, business transient recovery remained steady with RevPAR across large corporates, up more than 3%, driven by strong demand in consulting and government contracting. Group RevPAR rose nearly 5% year-over-year, led by strong convention and social demand. Additionally, corporate groups continue to grow as a percentage of booking mix and booking windows continue to lengthen.\n As we look to the rest of the year, we continue to expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%, with the U.S. towards the low end of the range and continued strength in international markets. We expect positive RevPAR growth across all major segments, led by group performance at or above the high end of the range, business transient around the midpoint and leisure transient towards the lower end of the range. For the full year, group position is up 13% versus last year.\n Turning to development. We started the year off strong, building on the positive momentum from 2023. In the quarter, we opened more than 100 hotels totaling approximately 17,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.6%. Hotel openings span nearly all brands, demonstrating the strength and breadth of our industry-leading brand portfolio. Conversions accounted for 30% of openings, largely driven by DoubleTree and Spark. In the quarter, we celebrated the addition of a number of new luxury and lifestyle properties, including the debut of LXR in Hawaii, the introduction of the Waldorf and Canopy brands to the Seychelles and the highly anticipated opening of the Conrad Orlando.\n Located within the newly developed Evermore Orlando Resort complex, the Conrad Orlando features 5 distinct dining venues, an 8-acre lagoon and expansive pool complex, a world-class spa and extensive meeting and event space. We also achieved several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 800th hotel in Asia Pacific, our 225th hotel in the CALA region and reached 25,000 true rooms globally. Additionally, Hampton opened its 3,000th property worldwide. Since its launch 40 years ago, the Hampton brand has been a category leader with the largest global pipeline of any focused service brand and the recently announced new North American prototype. Hampton continues to demonstrate the strength of our legacy brands and the power of our innovative approach to brand evolution, we are confident that the best is yet to come for this iconic brand.\n In the quarter, we signed 30,000 rooms, increasing our pipeline to a record 472,000 rooms, up 2% from last quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Signings meaningfully outperformed our expectations driven by strength in international markets. In Asia Pacific, we signed agreements for 4 new Conrad properties, further strengthening our luxury pipeline. Globally, an interest in Hilton Garden Inn remained particularly strong with the brand achieving the highest quarter of signings in its history. System-wide construction starts also outperformed expectations, up roughly 45% versus last year, with all major regions meaningfully higher. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more than 20% of industry share and nearly 4x our share of existing supply.\n We also recently announced several exciting partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions, further accelerating our expansion into the fast-growing lifestyle and experiences categories. Earlier this month, we acquired a controlling interest in Sydell Group to expand the NoMad brand from its existing London flagship location to high-end markets all around the world. Our development teams are fully engaged and we have a great pipeline building. Additionally, we announced an agreement with AJ Capital to acquire the Graduate Hotels brand, a collection of over 30 lifestyle hotels in university anchored towns, each Graduate Hotel, steeped in local history charm and nostalgia and designed to reflect the unique character of its local university, offering the perfect setting for game-based graduations, reunions and campus visits.\n Graduate presents a unique opportunity to serve more guests, especially in markets where we're not present today. With thousands of colleges and universities around the world, we believe the addressable market for the brand is 400 to 500 hotels globally. For the rapidly increasing number of travelers looking to prioritize exploration and adventure, we recently announced an exclusive partnership with the premier outdoor hospitality company, AutoCamp. Stays will be bookable on Hilton's direct channels in the coming months, and we will offer our guests an experience that blends the spirit of an outdoor adventure with the hospitality and design forward nicking of a boutique hotel.\n Hilton Honors members will be able to earn and redeem points on stays and enjoy exclusive membership benefits while experiencing sought-after locations around the United States, including several properties adjacent to popular national parks. Along with our previously announced exclusive partnership with small luxury hotels of the world, these offerings provide incredible opportunities to further accelerate our growth and enhance our network effect by broadening and deepening our customer offerings in some of the industry's fastest-growing markets and segments. As a result of our strong pipeline and all the great progress we've seen to date for the full year, we expect net unit growth of 6% to 6.5%, excluding the planned addition of Graduate.\n To provide even more personalized experiences for our guests, we continue to leverage our industry-leading technology platforms from a digitally enabled concierge for our luxury brands, to the ability to choose your room from a floor plan and control your in-room entertainment from your mobile device. We continue to fully integrate the digital experience. Additionally, recent initiatives like add-ons Hilton for Business and improved search functionality are driving even greater conversion and higher revenue.\n We also continue to be recognized for our incredible workplace culture, Fortune and Great Place to Work recently named Hilton, the #1 on the list of best companies to work for in the United States, marking our ninth consecutive year on the list, and our sixth consecutive year in the top 10. In total, we won 20 Great Place to Work awards around the world with 5 #1 wins. These recognitions follow our ranking as the #1 world's best workplace and make Hilton the only hospitality company to have earned the top spot on these prestigious lists.\n Overall, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, and we expect our industry-leading brands, strong development story and powerful business model to continue to drive growth. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results for the quarter and our expectations for the full year. Sure. Happy to cover that. That's a broad array of topic so really -- really artful questions, Stephen. I would say when you flush it all out, obviously, and Kevin covered it in his prepared comments, the first quarter from a RevPAR point of view is a little bit lighter than we thought, but sort of easily explained on the basis of what Kevin already talked about. We had a lot more under construction than we had anticipated, which is a good thing, but not enough rooms out of inventory in a lot of those assets, particularly in our limited service brands to take it out of the comp set. So that weighed on is weather, definitely, we didn't anticipate what was going on -- what happened in the Northeast at the beginning of the year.\n And then while we certainly knew about the holiday shift of Easter moving in. It was a little more impactful and spring break sort of ended up being like a rolling 4 weeks of spring break. And so we underestimated that. As we think about the full year, the way to think -- the way I think about our outlook is the way I think most people are thinking about the broader economy, and that is the broader economy is reasonably strong. It seems to be very resilient. Obviously, employment numbers are quite good. Corporate profits, it depends on the industry, are still quite strong. And so as we sort of factor for that for the rest of the year and we think about the various segments, it leads us to feel about the way we did when we talked to you last time. Meaning if we look at the big segments, the group business is still incredibly strong. The demand is great. Every month that goes by, it's very strong. \n While the first quarter was certainly choppy because of the movement of the holiday and all that. When you talk to customers, which we do all the time and I do, I think you get a very positive view about there are people traveling more for business transient. And because the economy has been resilient and employment has been strong, I think it helps with the underpinning, while leisure certainly is normalizing from super high levels. It gives you, I think, a reasonable amount of confidence that it's still going to be relatively strong, modest growth, mostly in the form of rate because we continue to have a decent amount of pricing power. And so when you sort of like put that all in the gonculator and spit it out at the end of the day, from a RevPAR from a top line point of view, that's why we maintained our guidance. First quarter, a little bit more choppy, but the reality is some of that reverses because of the holiday shift, we'll get the benefit in the second quarter, and we feel about the same based on a pretty consistent consensus view that the economy is going to maintain relative strength.\n On the development side, between Kevin's and my comments, you heard, I mean, we feel like we have a lot of momentum. I said it on the last call, that I think we were on the slope up. And I said -- and we said it at our Investor Day that over the next few years, we think we'll be at 6% to 7% in NUG, that's where we think we're going to be and the reality is we had strong expectations carrying over momentum from the end of the year, but it was better in terms of signings and starts and openings, frankly, that a little bit than we thought. And so as we look at the year and we look around the world and work with our development teams. I mean the reality is we think we're going to sign more deals than we've ever signed, and we're going to start more deals and more hotels under construction than we're going to sign. That obviously is helped by conversions, but it's also new development. I mean if you look at the new development versus conversions, they're both up in sort of the low teens.\n So there's a lot of momentum. What's driving that? Of course, we think people have a lot of interest in our brands because of their best-performing brands. But if you look at the broader system because of the relative strength of this economy and many other economies around the world, people are largely very profitable. And as a result of being very profitable in their existing portfolio, their desire is to continue to expand their businesses. And so we feel very, very good about what's going on. The financing environment. I'll leave some other things for maybe other questions I can keep going. But that's sort of both from a revenue top line point of view and a little bit of color on both and unit growth to give you a sense of how we think about the outlook for the year. Yes, modestly. I mean we think they will be lower in performance, but we think our forecasting and outlook is they will be positive but modestly so. And those were impacted in the first quarter by the things -- more dramatically by the things that I described. And by the way, comparability because the first -- if you look broadly in the first quarter over the last year, from the standpoint of how we perform relative to the industry overall, we had a much better performance than the industry, and that was really driven by the select service brands. And so they have lapped in the first quarter over very, very difficult comps. That gets easier, pretty difficult comps in Q2 for the record as well, but we think that gets much easier in the second half of the year from a comp issue. And so our expectation is they would be positive but lower than other higher chain scales. Yes. Taking one at a time. In terms of Group and BT versus '19, they are both eclipsing from a revenue point of view, but from a demand occupancy point of view, they're both below business transient modestly, pretty minor. Group a little bit more so, I think, like 500 basis points or something like that is from memory. They can, in fact, check me. And that has -- so let me cover in reverse order business transient is, I mean Group is just a function of gestation period for this to ramp up. I think by the time you get to the second half of the year, and certainly, by the end of the year, Group demand will be finally back to where -- just based on the underlying strength in that space.\n Business transient, as I said, is a little bit off. If you break it down between small, medium businesses versus the big corporates, the small, medium businesses are already demand-wise over, and the big corporates are under. But as you saw, we had pretty big growth relative to a quarter that wasn't a lot of -- was more leisure-oriented because of the holiday shift in big corporates, and that's what we're hearing from our big corporate customers as they're traveling more. So that is coming back. Their balance sheets are strong. Earnings are still -- maybe they're going up at a lower rate or whatever, but they're still relatively strong.\n And so our expectation is by the end of the year from a demand point of view, we think there's an awfully good chance that BT will get there, too, just with continued growth in the big corporates in very resilient SMB business. And that's sort of how we've baked our outlook. In terms of occupancy and rate, that sort of answers the question then because we think you are continuing to build occupancy through the rest of the year. I think you got to be really careful in the first quarter. The first quarter is super messy with the things that we've talked about going on. It's really hard to like glean much from that.\n But if you look at the Group trends, they are really strong, as I said, and that provides a tremendous platform to yield manage that we really haven't had in the way that we're starting to have. And if you agree with the sort of the underpinnings of business transient and occupancies are not raging up but are sort of grinding up. Again, that gives you a pretty good setup for some modest occupancy gains. Those are going to come in BT and Group, not in Leisure. In fact, you could have slight occupancy declines in Leisure, but I think in the core of the more days of the week than not, you're building more pricing power, which I think allows you to continue to have the ability to push rate. Yes. Thanks. I'm going to ask Kevin to take that. Yes. The other thing -- I think that's all perfect, I would add on relative to China is we are also, while people aren't coming into China, we are starting to see that shift. There are a lot more flights that are going to start in the second and third quarter that are going to be going from major destinations, including the United States into China, which is going to help. But we are also seeing is the Chinese customer and as much as we think will sort of be flattish this year because there was a huge surge in Chinese were staying in China and traveling all over China, and now they're leaving. We are a net beneficiary of that and other parts of Asia.\n So if you look at our Southeast Asia business, our Japanese business, I mean, they are largely predominantly staying into Asia at the moment. I think that's going to change as more flights open up. And so we're getting -- well, China is not surging in the sense we talk about, we are seeing other markets, particularly Southeast Asia and Japan that are huge beneficiaries of that migration. Yes. I mean we did say last time that we were going to incorporate SLH into it, and that is incorporated into our 6% to 6.5%. We ultimately will add in Graduate, but just we think the better convention is to add both the EBITDA and earnings impact and the net NUG impact once closed so that is not in that. I think the way to think about it going forward is the SLH is going to be probably coming into our system over the next couple of years. It's early days, but so far, we really like what we're seeing. We're getting a very, very high percentage of existing SLH members in the markets that we have been out and with SLH marketing to sign up and want to come into the system. And we have no reason to believe that won't continue, getting the technology and all that done, which is people are working on both sides very, very diligently on. We'll start to get us to the other side and incorporating assets and the ability for our customers to book through our channels and honors, earn and burn and all of that, sometime probably middle or late summer so I mean, it's a little bit of a moving feast.\n But the 6% to 6.5% does incorporate what we said last time. It's probably 1/4 to 0.5 point is the way to think about that consistent with what we said last time. And there'll be more next year built into that. And my guess is as we grow that business with them, it will continue to contribute probably at a lesser degree just because we'll get the bulk of the system in over this year and next. Graduate will be kind of a onetime thing. And as we said at our Investor Day, we believe -- and we don't have -- I said there, we had one other thing we were working on. We announced one thing since then. We don't -- I don't think you should expect that you're going to see any additions to NUG in that arena.\n Now I'm going to say because I always do, never say never. I've been saying that for the many years I've been running the company, but we don't have any other of those sorts of tricks up our sleeve anytime soon. So I think the way to think about our guidance of 6% to 7% over the next few years is there'll be a onetime sort of thing for Graduate, but it's otherwise organic in the way it's always been. Yes. I don't have the data point in my head, but I do know this. Yes, it's building for '25, '26. I believe both years are sort of high single, low double-digit increases relative to where we've been in the past. So yes, I mean, they're putting the data in front of me. So my memory is right, 13% and 15% up in '25 and '26. And what we really love about it is we did as I've talked about, it seems like time and eternity, luxury lifestyle. We did a huge amount of work because one of the options was to do this on our own, which you know we are pretty good at and like to do historically. And as we did the work over the last bunch of years, sort of like because this is always benefit in the skunk works, and I'm not exaggerating, this is sort of the ethos of what Andrew Zobler and his team have created a sort of bull's-eye for what we think is modern luxury lifestyle today and going forward in terms of what customers are looking for.\n And so it was a very efficient way for us to get in the space, accelerate our entry in the space, meaning take -- let's be honest, multiple years because they already have a pipeline, let alone what we're adding to it. And importantly, with Andrew and his team be able to effectively acquire a really talented team of people that are very steeped in the luxury lifestyle space. So we think it was sort of the trifecta. It hit every button for us in terms of making sense. But yes, it's very small. But hey, the good news is it's very small, we didn't pay a whole lot for it, and that means great organic growth going forward. Yes. Honors occupancy was, I think, at our historical high 64% and change up like 300 to something -- a little over 300 basis points year-over-year. And so Honors is working. Our customers are engaged more than I think any other program that is out in the industry. We do have a bunch of things that we are doing. Some of them you've seen that are -- what we're doing with SLH, what we're doing with AutoCamp, you should expect to see more not like Graduate type things, but more partnerships particularly in the experiential area. I think I talked about it on the last call so more AutoCamps, I think areas like safaris and yachts and other riverboat cruises and other things because we know that our customers -- those are adjunct sort of travel experiences that connect to our business that gives our base of customers, incremental things to engage with us that they want to do and is not in conflict in any way with our business, but we think is synergistic.\n And so there are a bunch of other things that we're doing that. But in reality, our expectation, while we, I think, to lead the industry, I know we do at 64%. We have aspirations as we talked about at Investor Day, to be really at 75%, maybe over time, even higher. And that's a very -- I'm not going to get into the details of it for a whole bunch of competitive reasons. But that is that is not 1 or 2 things. That's a series of strategies broadly for Honors, some of which I just talked about, further opportunities to keep customers engaged in other ways that are new and different and appealing to them.\n But it's also a significant amount of work that creates a more bespoke offering in certain major regions of the world, I think Asia Pacific, particularly China and other parts of the world where loyalty is a big deal, but what appeals to that customer base may be a little bit different than what might appeal to a customer base here in the United States. And so there's -- again, there are a whole bunch of different things that we are going to do. So I think you should have an expectation you'll continue to see that Honors occupancy go up as a result of greater engagement. Obviously, that is our lowest cost distribution channel. And so that's good for us and very good for our owners that it helps drive incremental market share gains and does it on a very cost-efficient basis. But I'm not going to get into granular strategies within Honors in this format or any format for that matter other than with our customers. Yes. I mean we do think the Olympics will be a nice positive for Europe broadly and obviously, for Paris and France. I mean our -- it's not going to dramatically impact our numbers just because Europe is a pretty big part of our portfolio. But if you look at France, while we're present in a lot of markets in France. We're not -- it's not a large portion of our portfolio. So it will be great, and it will help, but it's not going to help as much as if it was in New York City or summer where we had a huge density hotels.\n In terms of the first question, which I think is a really good question. And I think, listen, it deserves a good answer, and I'll give you the best I got. The best I got is who said it George H. W. Bush, it's the economy, stupid, I think. I'm not calling you stupid Bill, for the record. But it has everything to do with the economy. I mean the reality is, as I said in my comments, our outlook is based on a pretty -- not just consensus view, but a strong consensus view that the economy is going to be growing at a decent rate and employment is going to stay pretty strong. \n Obviously, higher for longer is the Fed's way of trying to like tamp things down. But there's no question in my mind, you can have your own view. Everybody can that the Fed is trying to orchestrate a soft landing. So far, it feels like they have been able to do it.\n Our outlook with the U.S. being at the low end of our guidance ranges sort of anticipate that consensus view, which is a soft landing, which means the economy is more resilient than people thought but broadly as the year goes on, softening because that's what the Fed is trying to do. And we have tried to sort of factor for all of that in our guidance. And so whether it's the upper end, lower end or wherever it is, I think it has everything to do with a broader economy. The good news for us is the median income of our core customer, like our lower member is high, it's $150,000 median income where the Fed where you look at the data out of the credit card companies and the retailers, it's like $100,000 and below is where you see people stretched and credit card balances, bank accounts running out and credit card balances going up. When you get up into the $150,000, the data still looks really good in terms of people have a lot of money in the bank and they have enough disposable income. \n And as I said, businesses, company, corporate America is still relatively strong. So I think of the economy, if they -- I think this range and outcome that we've given and sort of where the U.S. we think will flush out is based on the consensus view that we will have some slowing but a soft landing and positive economic growth. I think you answered it, large. That has more to do with seasonality than anything. And the calendar shift because remember, Leisure is sort of 25% or 30% of our business and because of the calendar -- because of the holiday shift, it ended up being a big leisure quarter, which meant Leisure was good, but the reality is then 70%, 75% of the business was not. And so I think it's a seasonal plus the compounding impact of the movement of the holiday. So I do think -- I mean, listen, we sort of got -- we got pretty close in December. So I mean, by the fourth quarter of last year, we were pretty tight on 2019 levels. A little bit, but I think it's good blocking and tackling. And we -- our flow-through of revenue to EBITDA, we think, is consistent with what we've been saying and outlining 50 -- low 50s and what we described at Investor Day. So Q1 is, I think, a good demonstration of great discipline in running the business even when top line was a little bit lighter than what we had hoped for. Thanks, everybody. As always, we appreciate you dedicating this much time as we've described. We feel good about the business, good about momentum, good about where broadly economies are to deliver the results that we've talked about and super good about the momentum we have on the development side. And we will look forward to talking to you this summer after we complete Q2. Thanks again and talk soon."
