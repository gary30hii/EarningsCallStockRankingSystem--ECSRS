This morning we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.15 billion, 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $3.59; $3.4 billion in adjusted segment operating profit, 12% higher than 2019; four straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating profit growth, and trailing four-quarter adjusted ROIC of 7.7%, almost 200 basis points above our weighted cost of capital. We are maintaining our strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows.  The team managed a wide variety of risks superbly and we achieved our strategic initiatives, exceeding our $500 million to $600 million guidance and driving our ability to deliver a steady, sustainable earnings growth. I\u2019d like to thank our team for this tremendous performance and highlight for you some of our many achievements in 2020. In our optimized pillar, around the globe amid lockdowns, rapidly shifting demand patterns and extreme weather events, our colleagues fulfilled our purpose by adapting and innovating to keep our work environment safe from COVID-19, maintaining our operations to support the global food value chain, and delivering for our customers to provide nutrition around the world. Beyond that, for the year, our ag services and oilseeds team delivered more than $300 million in capital reduction initiatives, and we are focusing on new ways to enhance the return structure of that business from digital technologies like our Grainbridge joint venture to differentiated products and services that add share value for growers, customers, and ADM. In our drive pillar, our new organizational structures and business processes, like our centers of excellence and our 1ADM business transformation project are helping drive better decision making and operational excellence. We continued our work to support our planet and its natural resources. We achieved our 15x20 environmental goals ahead of schedule and launched Strive 35, an even more ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water, and waste by 2035, and we\u2019re partnering with farmers in their efforts toward better outcomes, supported by the 6.5 million acres we have in sustainable farming programs over recent years. In our growth pillar, our nutrition team exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We expanded our plant-based protein capabilities, including the launch of our PlantPlus Foods joint venture, and amid an incredibly dynamic demand environment, we utilized new, innovative technologies and continued launching new products to ensure we\u2019re meeting our customers\u2019 needs.  Our carbohydrate solutions colleagues moved quickly to meet changing customer needs for retail flour, industrial starches for cardboards, and USP-grade alcohol for hand sanitizers, and the ADM team showed its innovative spirit by partnering and supporting companies that are making food out of air, spider silk out of corn, and animal feed out of insects. Finally, I\u2019m proud to say we surpassed by about 10% our stretch goal of $1.3 billion in readiness run rate benefits by the end of the year. Readiness is driving our strategic initiatives, enabling us to be more efficient and powering our growth. Perhaps most importantly, today we can say that readiness is truly embedded in our culture. It\u2019s how we work. Thanks to these impressive achievements, I\u2019m pleased to announce a quarterly dividend increase of 2.8% to $0.37 per quarter. This dividend will be our 357th consecutive quarterly payment, an uninterrupted record of 89 years.  It\u2019s been a remarkable year with achievements and results that truly demonstrate the strategic work we\u2019ve been doing over the years to optimize, drive, and grow. Even more important is how we\u2019re building for the future. We\u2019ve created and are now strengthening the strategic foundation to deliver steady, sustained earnings growth for years to come.  I\u2019ll be talking about that shortly, but first let me turn the call over to Ray to take us through our business performance. Ray?\nRay Young: Yes, thanks Juan, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide No. 4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.21, down from the $1.42 in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the recognition of about $0.61 per share for the retroactive biodiesel tax credits. Absent this, earnings would have grown by about 49%. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC, and our trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.7 billion.  The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 8% compared to a benefit of 1% in the prior year. The calendar year 2020 effective tax rate was approximately 5%, down from the approximately 13% in 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the impact of U.S. tax credits, mainly the railroad tax credits, which have an offsetting expense in the cost of products sold. Absent the effect of EPS-adjusting items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11%, and for the calendar year 2020, it was approximately 9%. Looking ahead, we\u2019re expecting full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.  We generated about $3.1 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, significantly higher than 2019. Return of capital for the year was $942 million, including more than $800 million from dividends.  We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up from the 29% a year ago due to higher working capital needs due to rising commodity prices. Capital spending for the year was about $820 million, in line with our guidance and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion dollars. For 2021, we expect capital spending to be in a range of $900 million to $1 billion. Slide 5, please. Other business results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter. ADM investor services earnings were impacted by drastically lower short-term interest rates. Captive insurance results were negatively impacted by $15 million more in net intra-company settlements compared to the prior year quarter. For 2021, we expect other business results to be in line with 2020. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $278 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, increased IT and project-related expenses, and centralization of certain costs, including from Neovia. Other charges decreased due to lower railroad maintenance expenses partially offset by the absence of prior year investment gains. For 2021, corporate unallocated should be overall similar to 2020. Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than last year due to lower short term interest rates and liability management actions taken in 2020. For 2021, we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be similar to or slightly lower than 2020. Slide 6, please. The ag services and oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year with record adjusting operating profit in the fourth quarter. Ag services results were significantly higher year over year. In North America, the team executed extremely well, capitalizing on strong global demand particularly from China to deliver higher export volumes and margins. South American origination was lower year over year after significantly accelerated farmer selling in the first half of 2020.  Global trade continued to do a great job, contributing to higher results by utilizing its global reach and managing risk well to meet customer demand. Approximately $80 million of prior timing effects reversed in the quarter, as expected.  Crushing also delivered substantially higher results versus the prior year period. The business did a great job to capture higher margins in a continued environment of tight soybean supply and strong global demand for both meal and vegetable oils. There was approximately $125 million in net negative timing in the quarter driven by basis impacts and improved soft seed margins.  Refined products and other results were higher year over year absent the recognition of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year, with good results driven primarily by solid South American margins. Wilmar\u2019s strong performance drove our equity earnings higher versus the prior year despite our slightly lower ownership stake.  For the full year, ag service and oilseeds delivered exceptional results of $2.1 billion, 9% higher than 2019. The team achieved multiple records, including all-time high global crush volumes. In addition, we\u2019re proud of the team that brought our reserve export facility back online safely and ahead of schedule despite dealing with multiple severe weather events this year. Looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 results for ag service and oilseeds to be significantly higher than the prior year first quarter, driven by extremely strong North America export demand and continued healthy crush margins. Slide 7, please. The carbohydrate solutions team again delivered substantially a higher year-over-year result despite the impacts of lockdowns in key market segments. The starches and sweeteners sub-segment achieved significantly higher results driven by lower net corn costs and intra-company insurance settlements. Earnings were partially offset by low results from corn oil and wet mill ethanol margins. Damaged corn processor results were also better versus the prior year, though they continue to reflect the challenging ethanol industry environment. The team delivered higher year-over-year margins as they met increased demand for USP-grade alcohol, partially offset by fixed costs from the two temporarily idled dry mills.  Considering the impact of lockdowns in both driving miles and the food service sectors, we\u2019re extremely proud of our carbohydrate solutions team for delivering full year results of $717 million, 11% higher than 2019. The team achieved record high operating profits from starches in the year. They acted decisively by temporarily idling production at our two VCP dry mill plants, helping address industry supply and demand balances, and the wheat milling business\u2019 modernization and optimization plan, including a new state of the art mill in Mendota, Illinois, helped power a significant improvement over full year 2019 for that business.  Looking ahead, we expect carbohydrate solutions results in the first quarter to be significantly higher than last year\u2019s first quarter, which was negatively impacted by corn oil mark to market impacts, but below the fourth quarter 2020 levels due to the challenged industry ethanol margins.  Slide 8, please. The nutrition team delivered 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter. In human nutrition, flavors delivered a strong quarter driven by good sales and product mix in North America and EMEAI. Continued strength in plant proteins drove higher results in specialty ingredients. Health and wellness delivered higher sales in probiotics and natural health and nutrition. Prior year results included revenue and income related to the launch of the strategic Spiber relationship. Human nutrition results for the quarter also included an intra-company insurance settlement.  Animal nutrition results were significantly higher year over year, driven by strong performances in Asia and EMEAI and improvements in amino acid results, partially offset by currency effects in Latin America. We\u2019re continuing to make improvements in our amino acid business, including our announcement last month that we\u2019re discontinuing dry lysine production and transitioning to our liquid and encapsulated products in the first half of this year.  For the full year, nutrition results were $574 million, 37% higher than 2019. The nutrition team grew revenue 5% on a constant currency basis and continued to expand EBITDA margins. We exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We are truly seeing the benefits of our investments in nutrition. Looking ahead, we expect nutrition to solidly grow operating profits in 2021 calendar year, but the first quarter should be similar to the prior year period due to timing of certain expenses over the year, including investments in projects to drive organic growth.  With that, let me turn it over to Juan to conclude. Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you Ray. Slide 9, please.  I\u2019d like to congratulate the team once more on delivering great results in 2020. I\u2019m proud of what we achieved and I\u2019m excited to see our work empowering us to reach even greater heights.  In 2020, ag services and oilseeds capitalized on its unparalleled and flexible global footprint to meet strong demand. In 2021, we expect ag services and oilseeds\u2019 strong execution, diverse and flexible crush capabilities, including an extensive soft seed footprint and important strategic work to continue to drive results. In addition, we expect the global demand environment for ag services and oilseeds to remain strong.  China should continue to be a significant buyer. We see continued strong global growth in meal demand and we expect increased demand for vegetable oil due to recovering cooking oils for food service and growth in demand for biofuels, including renewable green diesel. That is why we are confident in another outstanding performance from ag services and oilseeds in 2021. Carbohydrate solutions is showing how we have embedded great execution into our operational structure and culture. The team is doing a great job strengthening their business by optimizing their plans and product mix, and their ability to adjust production in 2020 to quickly meet changes in demand showed how those strategic efforts are paying off. Now they are well positioned to use those same tools as the effect of lockdowns on the food service and transportation fuel sectors dissipates throughout 2021. We expect solid profit growth for the year for carbohydrate solutions. Nutrition continued to harvest investments, leading consumer growth trend areas and partnering with customers to bring innovative new products and solutions to market in 2020. Based on our current organic growth plans, we expect the nutrition team to deliver solid revenue expansion and enter the period of an average of 15% per annum operating profit growth consistent with our strategic plan.  Across ADM, we are fulfilling our purpose and building on a foundation for steady, sustainable earnings growth. We are growing and leading in key trend areas, including food security, health and wellness, and sustainability. Our continued advancements of readiness is benefiting the entire enterprise and we\u2019re making investments in exciting growth innovation platforms, which we\u2019ll be talking more about in the future.  In 2021, we will remain focused on the drivers under our control, having incremental returns as we focus on organic growth, advancing operational excellence initiatives to maximize returns from every business and every asset, and continuing to generate benefits from readiness. With the strong execution of these strategic initiatives and improving market conditions as the year progresses, we expect to build on a record 2020 with strong growth in segment operating profit and another record year of EPS in 2021. With that, Shelby, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question is from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.\nMichael Piken: Yes, good morning. Congratulations on the good quarter. Just wanted to dig a little bit more into your thoughts on how U.S. crushing is going to play out throughout the year. I understand 1Q is going to be really strong, but are you worried about tightness and availability of soybeans as we move into the spring and summer, and how are you sort of positioning your crushing business in case the market gets a little bit tighter?\nJuan Luciano: Yes Michael, thank you for the question. Good morning. Listen, we expect 2021 to be a very, very strong year for oilseeds and ag services, maybe with a different mix of earnings that we have in this year. If you think about 2021, we\u2019re starting with tailwinds from 2020, so we\u2019re starting from a different position, and we\u2019re starting the year with improved global crush margins in Q1 versus Q1 last year. We see a year in which we flex a little bit more our capabilities. We see a strong, still soybean crush but an exceptional crop and recovery after many years of softness in the soft seed crush, and I\u2019d remind you that we have about 25% of our capacity in soft seed, and we have about 15% of our capacity that is shifting, so that\u2019s a competitive advantage for ADM.  We see a strong demand for meal, and we see also the vegetable story playing out with good global demand and prices that are today about 20% higher than at the same time last year, and not only coming from food demand but also from fuels, a new renewable green diesel capacity is having an impact in green oil demand and margins, and think that that could be something about half a billion pounds per year this year of extra demand, so all in all we see tight balances and we see a strong margin environment for the rest of the year.\nMichael Piken: Great. Then just as a follow-up, in your slide deck you talked about on Slide 13 having $295 million of cumulative crush deferred timing gains, is that all showing up in oilseed crush or is that across the whole portfolio, and if you could give us any sort of help in terms of the cadence of when we might see that realized - is it going to be primarily in 1Q or more evenly spread throughout the first half? Thanks.\nRay Young : Yes Michael, it\u2019s Ray here. This is in the crush part of the ag services and oilseeds. As you pointed out, we increased by $125 million in the quarter, so now we have a balance of about $295 million in timing effects. We expect that roughly half will get reversed in the first quarter based upon the book that we have right now, and then the other half will be reversed over the second and third quarters and actually we\u2019ll see how prices move, but this is our current expectations in terms of how we expect this to play out over the course of \u201921.\nMichael Piken: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone. \nRay Young: Morning Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: I guess my first question was going to be around the carbohydrate solutions business. I know you talked about seeing a pathway for growth there, and understanding especially in the first half of the year there\u2019s some pretty easy comps in terms of capacity utilization and weak volumes on the HFCS side, but help us think through some of the different pieces there. Ethanol in the first half of this year looks to be in a bit of a tougher spot, obviously corn prices have moved up pretty notably. Just trying to think about some of the different moving pieces and help us how we get to growth in that business in 2021.\nRay Young: Yes, sure Adam. Let me start here.  It\u2019s useful to refer to also how they manage 2020, right, because 2020, when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively impacted, yet in 2020 they grew earnings. What they did was they really managed product mix extremely well - you know, driving starches, driving industrial alcohol. They managed the ethanol production well and frankly had a positive impact on industry margins through the idling actions it took. But what a lot of people forget is we have an international business that\u2019s growing, right so we\u2019re expanding capacity over in Europe, and the European operations almost doubled in profitability in 2020 compared to 2019, a big contributor there. In the North America milling operations, their footprint optimization is really paying off with 20% growth in profitability in \u201920 versus \u201919, so when you think about 2021, this playbook continues. Number one, we do expect stabilizations in the North American starches and sweetener business as the beginnings of recovery in demand for certain products occur with the dissipation of lockdowns. Secondly, they\u2019re continuing to drive great product portfolio mix, so particularly in the area of liquid dextrose and maltodextrin and citric acid. Those are actually, from a product mix perspective, very beneficial. Thirdly, continued international growth, so when you think about where sugar prices are around the world right now, our European operations, whereby we\u2019ve added capacity, continues to drive growth, they\u2019re going to be another contributor. Then lastly, we expect continued growth in terms of our milling operations, and very pleased in terms of how their optimization plan is really playing out. Now getting back to some of the comments on the year-over-year comparison, we start off the year with weaker margins in ethanol, but if you recall in last year, margins actually hit a low of negative $0.45 in March. We don\u2019t see that, so when you think about year-over-year comparisons, we\u2019re going to start off on a challenged basis but we do expect the industry supply-demand balances in the ethanol industry get better balance as we move through the year, for several reasons. Number one, China actually has been buying U.S. ethanol. That\u2019s something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years, and we believe that they\u2019ve already made commitments already in the first half of the year for U.S. ethanol equal to the previous all-time high for the calendar year, roughly 200 million gallons. We\u2019ll have to see where China ends up in the calendar year in terms of imports of U.S. ethanol.  Secondly, there has been announced reconfiguration of ethanol capacity by various competitors in the industry as they kind of focus their production away from transportation fuel ethanol towards other products, so that\u2019s going to have an impact in industry supply and demand. Thirdly, the industry itself, there is about 10% to 15% of capacity that remains idled, and from our perspective we\u2019re going to remain very disciplined in terms of when we actually re-start the dry mills because we\u2019ll want to see sustainable margins before we re-start, and hopefully sometime in the first half we\u2019re going to see that. Then lastly, how the small refinery exemptions will play out over the first part of the year as the Supreme Court rules on it will have an impact, frankly, in terms of domestic demand for ethanol. If you take a look at RINs pricing right now, there is an expectation in the U.S. that domestic ethanol demand is going to be strong over the course of this calendar year, given just a recovery in terms of driving miles as we go through the year and then, secondly, how the expectations in terms of how the SREs will play out. Overall, Adam, we feel good about how we start the year in terms of the carb solutions businesses, but we do see particularly in the area of ethanol, we see green shoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here.\nAdam Samuelson: That\u2019s a lot of really helpful color, Ray. If I could just squeeze in a second one, just on the balance sheet, just given the move up in commodity prices, the increased cost of inventory, how do we think about the tolerance for more offensive capital deployment in terms of buybacks or M&A over the course of \u201921? How much dry powder do you think you have as we sit here today?\nRay Young: Well, we finished the year actually from a leverage perspective on a debt to EBITDA ratio in reasonable position because, as you know, inventory financing from a rating agency perspective, you get RMI credit, so with the movement in higher commodity prices which moved working capital higher, clearly we\u2019re financing it. One of the things very different than the last crisis back in 2008 is that we\u2019ve really diversified our working capital lines, and so I feel good about our ability to finance a higher working capital level. But from a leverage perspective with the RMI credits, our leverage--our balance sheet remains strong, and so we believe we\u2019ve got fire power in order to continue to look at opportunistic M&A and opportunistic share buybacks over the course of the year.\nAdam Samuelson: All right, I really appreciate all that color. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. \nVincent Andrews: Thanks, and good morning everyone. Ray, Juan, just wanted to ask you both about the inverse that we see in the corn and soy markets and how you\u2019re going to manage that in the ag services business this year, and what challenges or opportunities does that present for you?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, thank you Vince. Listen, the inverse certainly is indicating to farmers and everybody that to bring the product to the market, so we see a little bit of this talking - of course, nobody wants to run that inverse through--cold inventory through the inverse. What we are seeing is that that inverse is bringing is that--is bringing clear assistance for exports for North America and South America, and we think that that\u2019s an advantage for the ag services business in which it brings better margins normally for export season. You\u2019re going to see a little bit what happened last year, you know, that Brazil sold everything, run out of material, then the tide shifted immediately for the U.S. The U.S. is starting from an extended window of exports because of Brazil started a little bit late the planting, so we are starting with good margins, we are starting with good exports for the first quarter. For the first quarter, Vince, we expect U.S. record volumes for Q1 and then we expect a very strong season at the end of the year with another strong Q4. We\u2019re very, very optimistic about it.\nVincent Andrews: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. If I could just follow up on freight rates, they really have run up. Is that something that you benefit from, because presumably you have long term contracts that those freight rates have to get pushed into the market pricing, and you just maybe get the benefit on the revenue line but don\u2019t experience the cost, or is there a different dynamic there?\nJuan Luciano: No, I think you are correct in your assessment. You also have to understand the value of the full value chain that we run in ADM. When I describe, for example, record exports, that means also record loads for ARTCO, so we get a secondary stream of profits from there for the full value chain. We have stevedoring, we have the barges, and we have the export terminals, so the whole--when you have that kind of volume, the whole value chain gets enhanced margins all through the chain.\nVincent Andrews: Okay, very good. I appreciate the comments. I\u2019ll pass it along.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. \nBen Bienvenu: Hey, thanks. Good morning everybody. \nRay Young: Morning Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: I wanted to ask your outlook for the year for 2021, you made a note in your press release and in your comments that you expect improved market conditions. I suspect in light of the detailed comments that you gave, you\u2019re referring to the carbohydrate solutions group particularly, but I\u2019d be curious what you\u2019re expecting on the ag services and oilseeds. Is 2020 a number that you think is probable to be eclipsed for EBIT based on the market view that you have right now, or how should we be thinking about that setup?\nJuan Luciano: Yes Ben, when I think about the three businesses for 2021 and when we think about a strong 2021, the ag services and oilseeds business will be a very, very strong year, as I said before, maybe with a different mix of earnings with maybe we\u2019re not going to get to the same levels in RPO business or maybe South American oils, but we\u2019re going to have a better canola and soft seed margins in general for the business. We still expect exports from ag services to be very strong.  We had an exceptionally strong year for global trade in 2020, which I think we\u2019re going to have a strong year, we don\u2019t know exactly we\u2019re going to get to the same level. We plan another outstanding year for ag services and oilseeds in 2021. Carb solutions, I think that that\u2019s the business, as Ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impact by COVID-19, and we think that last year, it was a very tough year in which the team did an outstanding job of growing earnings 11% in that environment. We think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that, and with some exports to China in ethanol, we expect there are many elements there to build a more constructive scenario in 2021 than in 2020. The nutrition business will continue to grow. We are investing in that business and it\u2019s a business that has a strong organic growth program, and we see in that range, as I mentioned before, that when we look at the strategic plan for nutrition as we grow nutrition to the billion-dollar OP during our plan, we\u2019ll look for 15% CAGR to get there, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting for this year.  That\u2019s how I think about 2021.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, that\u2019s great. If I could, as it relates to 1Q in particular for carbohydrate solutions, you noted you expect results to be significantly higher than 1Q20 but lower than 4Q20. That\u2019s a pretty big range. Is there any more granularity you could provide there? Should we be thinking about something north of $100 million based on the current market view, or is that too high? Maybe just any more specificity, if you\u2019re willing to give it, on that segment in particular in 1Q, and then I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nRay Young: Yes, a lot of it is going to be a function of where ethanol moves over the course of the year. We expect it to be over $100 million. We expect it to be over $100 million, but where we land, a lot of it will be where ethanol moves over the next couple months here. But again, if you recall last year, we had about $65 million of negative corn oil market to market that won\u2019t get repeated, so that\u2019s going to be a benefit in our first quarter results this year.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, thank you both, and best of luck in this year.\nRay Young: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Congratulations on a great year. I wanted to know if you have any color for us on the impact of rising corn costs. There\u2019s some comparison, I guess benefits compared to last year where corn oil was out of sync, but is rising corn costs going to be a problem for carbohydrate solutions at any point, and maybe you could talk more specifically about high fructose corn syrup negotiations and were you able to increase your prices to offset the higher corn costs. Thanks.\nRay Young: Yes Rob, it\u2019s Ray here. A couple things to note. First of all, the team did an outstanding job on risk management, so without disclosing everything that they do, it\u2019s fair to say that we had a lot of our requirements for 2021 hedged before the significant run-up in terms of corn costs. I think that the team did some great work in terms of anticipating how S&Ds would actually work over the course of 2021. With respect to contracts, just a reminder not every contract gets negotiated in the contract cycle. We have multi-year contracts, and so a certain amount of contracts got negotiated and the outcome of the negotiations is the fact that we expect to be able to maintain our margins as we go through 2021 relative to 2020, through a combination of contract negotiations as well as the efforts that we\u2019re doing in terms of managing the mix and also managing our costs there. The other comment in terms of rising corn costs, and also given really a strong demand environment for feed, is you\u2019ve seen cold product values go up. That\u2019s a benefit for our businesses as well, so I think in the fourth quarter we made the comment that part of the strong results is that we had very favorable net corn costs. We expect that the team is also going to be able to manage through \u201921 with good net corn cost as well, so I think the team--and the carb sol team, they\u2019ve done an outstanding job on the risk management side in managing through the higher corn cost environment here.\nJuan Luciano: Rob, if I may add, I think something that gives us confidence, because of course the team is pretty good at doing this, is that in very tight markets, the fundamentals become more important because markets move more based on fundamentals, and there the information we have, the visibility we have in the network becomes much more important to make decisions than in other times, when maybe materials are a little bit longer and softer. Then, there are more variables that come into play.\nRobert Moskow: Maybe you can\u2019t this much detail, but in the contracts that you were negotiating, were you able to negotiate prices higher in reaction to higher corn, or was it not like that?\nRay Young: I think, Rob, let\u2019s keep it to the fact that we\u2019ve been able to manage in total the portfolio, the contracts and being able to maintain the margins year over year. That\u2019s the level of disclosure I think we want to make at this point. Thank you.\nRobert Moskow: Got it, okay. Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question is from Ken Zaslow of BMO.\nKen Zaslow: Hey, good morning everyone. I have two questions. First, the capex spending is going up. What are you incrementally spending on and what do you think the returns are, and when will you actually get the returns associated with that and how do we think about the incremental products there? That\u2019s my first question.\nRay Young: Ken, a couple things on the increased capex. One, I mentioned that we are in the midst of a business transformation program, so 2021 will be one of our peak years into a project, the One ADM project, so we do have some capitalized--some incremental capitalized costs associated with the program that\u2019s part of our capex budget. Secondly, with the pandemic in 2020, some projects got moved over, got pushed from 2020 into 2021. Some of them are growth projects, some of them are cost reduction projects, some of them are non-discretionary expenditure projects, so there\u2019s a series of projects that we did push from 2020 to \u201921 just due to the pandemic and our ability to execute.  Then thirdly, we do have growth projects. We mentioned organic growth, our focus in that area, so we do have organic growth projects going on in the course of 2021. Those are the three buckets as to why the number is increasing from the number that we finished up in \u201920 from \u201921.  Again, the range, $900 million to $1 billion is a large range. We haven\u2019t approved some of these projects, we\u2019re just putting it in terms of a placeholder, but part of our discipline is we will be evaluating the timing, the returns, and determining do we actually spend it in the course of \u201921 or not. As you know, in terms of growth projects, our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages, right? Our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages in order to approve these projects.\nJuan Luciano: And I\u2019d remind you, Ken, that first of all, we are also becoming a larger company, so there are projects now that our organic growth is coming from the new Neovia acquisition, the animal nutrition. We are expanding our bioactives production in Valencia, Spain, so we are becoming a larger company. I\u2019d also remind you that we have a program to divest to reduce capital investment, and we achieved $300 million in that side of the ledger, so we\u2019ll continue with the same capital discipline done before. You can be assured of that.\nKen Zaslow: Great. Then my second question, really more of a clarification, you said in 2021 EPS and operating profit would be higher year over year, or could be significantly higher - I forgot the exact word, but does that include or exclude the $295 million? I\u2019ll leave it there.\nRay Young: You\u2019re referring to the $295 million of timing effects, Ken?\nKen Zaslow: Yes, are you going to be able to grow numbers outside that $295 million, or is that $295 million included in what you think is going to be a year-over-year--\nRay Young: It\u2019s all included there. It\u2019s all included in the number there, Ken - all included. \nKen Zaslow: Would you be able to grow even without that, or is that part of the--I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out, when you say significant growth, is that beyond the $295 million or is that including? If you didn\u2019t have the $295 million, would you still be able to grow? I\u2019ll leave it there.\nRay Young: There\u2019s a lot of puts and takes there, Ken, right, so I think it\u2019s fair to say that our pre-tax numbers are going to grow significantly and there is going to be a little--you take a little bit off with the higher tax rate. I think that\u2019s probably the more important factor, is our higher tax rate will skim off a little bit of the pre-tax improvement that we\u2019re going to drive in \u201921 versus \u201920.\nKen Zaslow: Okay, great. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Tom Simonitsch of JP Morgan.\nTom Simonitsch: Hi, good morning everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Morning Tom.\nTom Simonitsch: Just following up on U.S. export strength, how much U.S. corn do you expect China to import beyond this marketing year?\nJuan Luciano: Yes Tom - sorry, I was trying to get my mask off. We\u2019re expecting China to take about 25 million tons of corn, so you know the situation there in China - we think that inventories are much--reserves are much lower than what the market is reporting there. You can see that in the prices that we\u2019ve seen. China didn\u2019t have a great crop, so we expect significant imports for both oilseeds and corn.\nTom Simonitsch: Do you think that 25 million tons is sustainable beyond this marketing year?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, we think so, we think so. Of course, not all comes from the U.S., it comes from different sources, but it is. China is trying other things as well - you know, they are reducing a little bit their wheat stocks, they have imported a lot of wheat from Australia as well. Remember that all this is driven by the recovery from ASF - they are trying to rebuild the curve, but also by the professionalization of the feeding that has included much more of all these grains into Russia. We think that we will continue to see multi-year increases in China\u2019s appetite for all these commodities.\nTom Simonitsch: Okay, thank you. Maybe you could break down your nutrition outlook for 2021 - you mentioned the 15% segment profit growth. How does that compare for human versus animal nutrition?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, they have different dynamics. Human nutrition is much more related to specific innovation projects that are driven by customers in our pipeline, and we feel very strongly about that. Our pipeline continues to grow and our win rates continue to grow. Animal nutrition has been a little bit more affected by COVID in the sense that there are some parts of it, like aquaculture, where fish and shrimp are much more consumed in restaurants than at home, while on the other hand pet, with people spending more time at home, companion animals have become a little bit better. I would say there are puts and takes there, and it\u2019s difficult to judge ahead of time. I think the important thing about the nutrition business is when you take a look at what\u2019s happening, is that that\u2019s a business that is investing in growth but also has been able to grow returns and to grow margins within the year in both divisions, both in animal and in human nutrition. I think we\u2019re going to continue to see that with, as I said, the different paths to growth with animal nutrition more in building organic growth for some of the projects, especially in Asia and in parts of Latin America, and then in human nutrition with more specific customer innovation projects in North America and Europe. \nTom Simonitsch: That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you Tom.\nOperator: Your next question is from Eric Larson of Global Securities. \nEric Larson: Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone, and congratulations on a really good year. \nRay Young: Thank you Eric.\nEric Larson: Juan, I just want to dive a little--I just want to add a little bit--my first question is on nutrition, just add a little bit more clarity to that. Last year, you had talked about harvesting more of your investments. You built a lot of plants in South America, in Asia for your nutrition business. I still expect that harvesting that investment is still a big part of your earnings story and your margin story. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in your harvesting of margins for nutrition, and I\u2019m sure it differs between human and animal, but can you help us with that a little bit?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I would say the harvesting continues. These plants that we built are relatively new plants, whether it\u2019s pea protein or specialty proteins in Campo Grande, so we\u2019re going to have harvesting for many years down the road, hopefully. I would say that 2021 is a year of heavier investment, if you will, again another round of investment. Some of those things are capabilities, whether it\u2019s customer insights and marketing, whether it\u2019s new digital connections to customers, new models to innovate virtually, and even a lot of organic growth. We have--we kind of went light in organic growth projects in animal nutrition during 2020 because we were working on the synergies and, to be honest, because the COVID environment didn\u2019t allow for a lot of project work. Now, we are going into more of that, so you\u2019re going to see 2021 being a little bit heavier investment in that, in capabilities and plant. Some of these, you don\u2019t see because this is building the foundations. We are a science based nutrition company, but you see for example in the quarter, we got two awards. We got the FIE Award for Innovation in Pea Protein, and we got the BIG Innovation Award for BPL1, one of our probiotics. We continue to invest in science, in customer insights and in organic growth in this business as we harvest, and the harvesting you see in how our ROIC continues to grow in that business and you see the success of our value proposition in how the EBITDA margins continue to grow in our business.  We are very happy, but Eric, we are at the early stages of building the best nutrition company out there. We are probably halfway through that build. \nEric Larson: Okay, great. Thanks for the color there. Juan, the question that I have, and you\u2019ve talked a lot about demand around the world, which is even surprisingly strong despite the grain pricing environment that we have, which is pretty high, and we\u2019re still seeing good exports. But when you look at the U.S. crop upcoming planting season this year, you look at what\u2019s going on in South America, which is clearly the world needed 140 million metric tons of soybeans out of Brazil and they\u2019re not going to get that, and we\u2019re seeing wheat in Russia, can you--it seems to me when you just put all the numbers together on a global basis, we are not going to rebuild these global supplies in a single year. It might take a couple years of good weather and all of that to sustain demand. Can you kind of encapsulate how ADM is looking at the next two years regarding demand and supply of global grains?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, we see an environment of real demand, real effective demand happening out there, and to be honest, our customers don\u2019t have a lot of inventory because everybody has been talking of going hand to mouth with this inverse, so we see truly strong demand and tight balance sheets. As you said, corn and oilseeds, I think they\u2019re going to touch [indiscernible] balance sheet. Wheat is a little bit stronger, but the Black Sea has not had a great wheat season, although Australia has a wheat growing season, so we see this is going to take 18 to 24 months for these supply-demand balances to be rebuilt. We see these conditions persisting for the next couple of years, even with farmers, imagine like you, trying to plant more, because I think that these prices will bring more acres into production. But we need those extra acres right now.\nEric Larson: Yes, so not only plant more acres but we\u2019ll also try to maximize our yields, so it\u2019s the combination of both, so.\nJuan Luciano: Right.\nEric Larson: Thank you, gentlemen, I\u2019ll pass it on.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you Eric.\nOperator: Your final question is from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\nBen Theurer: Good morning Juan, Ray, and congrats on the results. Just wanted to follow up on the capex related to the different businesses. Clearly you\u2019ve been putting a lot of emphasis on the growth and the prospects within nutrition, and you\u2019ve just said this will be another year in the need of investments in order to get to that 15% CAGR you\u2019ve been talking about. If we think about the capex in general, that $900 million to maybe a billion dollars, which is clearly up from what we saw in the last two years, could you give us a little bit of an understanding how you allocate or how you plan to allocate within that capex to the different segments, and in particular to the nutrition business, just to understand how much capital you\u2019re adding to that business?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, something that you have to understand, and I\u2019m going to speak at a high level here, but the nutrition has a different OP to capital sensitivity than the other businesses. These projects are--sometimes you have big projects like Campo Grande for specialty proteins, but the rest of the projects, if you think that the commodity business has maybe a multiplier of you need five units of capex to get one unit of OP, sometimes in nutrition you get a one-on-one. I think the issue is that because it\u2019s a smaller business, sometimes this investment, this effort has a higher impact in the P&L because they need to carry as they grow and as they build the smaller business. But I would say the nutrition is not a heavy capital intensive business, so when you hear me speaking about animal nutrition organic growth projects, those are small projects. They are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars type of projects, so I would say we continue to emphasize them but it\u2019s not a heavy burden on the capital. That\u2019s why we\u2019re growing so fast and we still are not forecasting north of a billion dollars, even when we\u2019re doing One ADM and all that. I think it\u2019s very affordable growth from a capital perspective. \nRay Young: There\u2019s a couple, Ben. There\u2019s a couple large projects in the carb solutions business that we\u2019re finishing up in 2021, so the Bulgaria expansion, we\u2019re finishing up, we\u2019re finishing up the building of the feed health in Clinton, so there\u2019s a couple of chunky investments that we\u2019re just finishing up over the course of \u201921.\nBen Theurer: Okay, perfect Juan and Ray, thanks. Then one final one - just netting it out, you\u2019ve been talking about the ethanol imports over to China, but how is that netting out versus Brazil and what you\u2019re seeing there? Is that--is this just a tit for take, south to north, or how is the balance currently on that export business to China?\nJuan Luciano: I think--listen, exports to China, we\u2019ve been talking a lot about that. We expect this year will be a record high, so they are taking because, you know, corn is expensive in China. You also need to remember in this equation, sugar prices are at an all-time high, so in Brazil you make a choice, so it\u2019s different than the U.S., in Brazil you make a choice how much you make of sugar and ethanol, and of course sugar prices are a big temptation this year. We expect higher exports and maybe we expect a little bit of less pressure from Brazil in that sense. \nBen Theurer: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll leave it here. Thanks.\nOperator: There are no other questions in queue at this time. Ms. De La Huerga, do you have any closing remarks?\nVictoria De La Huerga: Yes, thank you for joining us today. Slide 10 notes upcoming investor events in which we will be participating. As always, please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you Victoria.  This morning we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, up 49% year-over-year if we exclude the prior year impact of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.15 billion, 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $3.59; $3.4 billion in adjusted segment operating profit, 12% higher than 2019; four straight quarters of year-over-year segment operating profit growth, and trailing four-quarter adjusted ROIC of 7.7%, almost 200 basis points above our weighted cost of capital. We are maintaining our strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows.  The team managed a wide variety of risks superbly and we achieved our strategic initiatives, exceeding our $500 million to $600 million guidance and driving our ability to deliver a steady, sustainable earnings growth. I'd like to thank our team for this tremendous performance and highlight for you some of our many achievements in 2020. In our optimized pillar, around the globe amid lockdowns, rapidly shifting demand patterns and extreme weather events, our colleagues fulfilled our purpose by adapting and innovating to keep our work environment safe from COVID-19, maintaining our operations to support the global food value chain, and delivering for our customers to provide nutrition around the world. Beyond that, for the year, our ag services and oilseeds team delivered more than $300 million in capital reduction initiatives, and we are focusing on new ways to enhance the return structure of that business from digital technologies like our Grainbridge joint venture to differentiated products and services that add share value for growers, customers, and ADM. In our drive pillar, our new organizational structures and business processes, like our centers of excellence and our 1ADM business transformation project are helping drive better decision making and operational excellence. We continued our work to support our planet and its natural resources. We achieved our 15x20 environmental goals ahead of schedule and launched Strive 35, an even more ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water, and waste by 2035, and we're partnering with farmers in their efforts toward better outcomes, supported by the 6.5 million acres we have in sustainable farming programs over recent years. In our growth pillar, our nutrition team exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We expanded our plant-based protein capabilities, including the launch of our PlantPlus Foods joint venture, and amid an incredibly dynamic demand environment, we utilized new, innovative technologies and continued launching new products to ensure we're meeting our customers' needs.  Our carbohydrate solutions colleagues moved quickly to meet changing customer needs for retail flour, industrial starches for cardboards, and USP-grade alcohol for hand sanitizers, and the ADM team showed its innovative spirit by partnering and supporting companies that are making food out of air, spider silk out of corn, and animal feed out of insects. Finally, I'm proud to say we surpassed by about 10% our stretch goal of $1.3 billion in readiness run rate benefits by the end of the year. Readiness is driving our strategic initiatives, enabling us to be more efficient and powering our growth. Perhaps most importantly, today we can say that readiness is truly embedded in our culture. It's how we work. Thanks to these impressive achievements, I'm pleased to announce a quarterly dividend increase of 2.8% to $0.37 per quarter. This dividend will be our 357th consecutive quarterly payment, an uninterrupted record of 89 years.  It's been a remarkable year with achievements and results that truly demonstrate the strategic work we've been doing over the years to optimize, drive, and grow. Even more important is how we're building for the future. We've created and are now strengthening the strategic foundation to deliver steady, sustained earnings growth for years to come.  I'll be talking about that shortly, but first let me turn the call over to Ray to take us through our business performance. Ray? Thank you Ray. Slide 9, please.  I'd like to congratulate the team once more on delivering great results in 2020. I'm proud of what we achieved and I'm excited to see our work empowering us to reach even greater heights.  In 2020, ag services and oilseeds capitalized on its unparalleled and flexible global footprint to meet strong demand. In 2021, we expect ag services and oilseeds' strong execution, diverse and flexible crush capabilities, including an extensive soft seed footprint and important strategic work to continue to drive results. In addition, we expect the global demand environment for ag services and oilseeds to remain strong.  China should continue to be a significant buyer. We see continued strong global growth in meal demand and we expect increased demand for vegetable oil due to recovering cooking oils for food service and growth in demand for biofuels, including renewable green diesel. That is why we are confident in another outstanding performance from ag services and oilseeds in 2021. Carbohydrate solutions is showing how we have embedded great execution into our operational structure and culture. The team is doing a great job strengthening their business by optimizing their plans and product mix, and their ability to adjust production in 2020 to quickly meet changes in demand showed how those strategic efforts are paying off. Now they are well positioned to use those same tools as the effect of lockdowns on the food service and transportation fuel sectors dissipates throughout 2021. We expect solid profit growth for the year for carbohydrate solutions. Nutrition continued to harvest investments, leading consumer growth trend areas and partnering with customers to bring innovative new products and solutions to market in 2020. Based on our current organic growth plans, we expect the nutrition team to deliver solid revenue expansion and enter the period of an average of 15% per annum operating profit growth consistent with our strategic plan.  Across ADM, we are fulfilling our purpose and building on a foundation for steady, sustainable earnings growth. We are growing and leading in key trend areas, including food security, health and wellness, and sustainability. Our continued advancements of readiness is benefiting the entire enterprise and we're making investments in exciting growth innovation platforms, which we'll be talking more about in the future.  In 2021, we will remain focused on the drivers under our control, having incremental returns as we focus on organic growth, advancing operational excellence initiatives to maximize returns from every business and every asset, and continuing to generate benefits from readiness. With the strong execution of these strategic initiatives and improving market conditions as the year progresses, we expect to build on a record 2020 with strong growth in segment operating profit and another record year of EPS in 2021. With that, Shelby, please open the line for questions. Yes Michael, thank you for the question. Good morning. Listen, we expect 2021 to be a very, very strong year for oilseeds and ag services, maybe with a different mix of earnings that we have in this year. If you think about 2021, we're starting with tailwinds from 2020, so we're starting from a different position, and we're starting the year with improved global crush margins in Q1 versus Q1 last year. We see a year in which we flex a little bit more our capabilities. We see a strong, still soybean crush but an exceptional crop and recovery after many years of softness in the soft seed crush, and I'd remind you that we have about 25% of our capacity in soft seed, and we have about 15% of our capacity that is shifting, so that's a competitive advantage for ADM.  We see a strong demand for meal, and we see also the vegetable story playing out with good global demand and prices that are today about 20% higher than at the same time last year, and not only coming from food demand but also from fuels, a new renewable green diesel capacity is having an impact in green oil demand and margins, and think that that could be something about half a billion pounds per year this year of extra demand, so all in all we see tight balances and we see a strong margin environment for the rest of the year. Yes, thank you Vince. Listen, the inverse certainly is indicating to farmers and everybody that to bring the product to the market, so we see a little bit of this talking - of course, nobody wants to run that inverse through--cold inventory through the inverse. What we are seeing is that that inverse is bringing is that--is bringing clear assistance for exports for North America and South America, and we think that that's an advantage for the ag services business in which it brings better margins normally for export season. You're going to see a little bit what happened last year, you know, that Brazil sold everything, run out of material, then the tide shifted immediately for the U.S. The U.S. is starting from an extended window of exports because of Brazil started a little bit late the planting, so we are starting with good margins, we are starting with good exports for the first quarter. For the first quarter, Vince, we expect U.S. record volumes for Q1 and then we expect a very strong season at the end of the year with another strong Q4. We're very, very optimistic about it. No, I think you are correct in your assessment. You also have to understand the value of the full value chain that we run in ADM. When I describe, for example, record exports, that means also record loads for ARTCO, so we get a secondary stream of profits from there for the full value chain. We have stevedoring, we have the barges, and we have the export terminals, so the whole--when you have that kind of volume, the whole value chain gets enhanced margins all through the chain. Thank you. Yes Ben, when I think about the three businesses for 2021 and when we think about a strong 2021, the ag services and oilseeds business will be a very, very strong year, as I said before, maybe with a different mix of earnings with maybe we're not going to get to the same levels in RPO business or maybe South American oils, but we're going to have a better canola and soft seed margins in general for the business. We still expect exports from ag services to be very strong.  We had an exceptionally strong year for global trade in 2020, which I think we're going to have a strong year, we don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. We plan another outstanding year for ag services and oilseeds in 2021. Carb solutions, I think that that's the business, as Ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impact by COVID-19, and we think that last year, it was a very tough year in which the team did an outstanding job of growing earnings 11% in that environment. We think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that, and with some exports to China in ethanol, we expect there are many elements there to build a more constructive scenario in 2021 than in 2020. The nutrition business will continue to grow. We are investing in that business and it's a business that has a strong organic growth program, and we see in that range, as I mentioned before, that when we look at the strategic plan for nutrition as we grow nutrition to the billion-dollar OP during our plan, we'll look for 15% CAGR to get there, and that's what we're expecting for this year.  That's how I think about 2021. Rob, if I may add, I think something that gives us confidence, because of course the team is pretty good at doing this, is that in very tight markets, the fundamentals become more important because markets move more based on fundamentals, and there the information we have, the visibility we have in the network becomes much more important to make decisions than in other times, when maybe materials are a little bit longer and softer. Then, there are more variables that come into play. And I'd remind you, Ken, that first of all, we are also becoming a larger company, so there are projects now that our organic growth is coming from the new Neovia acquisition, the animal nutrition. We are expanding our bioactives production in Valencia, Spain, so we are becoming a larger company. I'd also remind you that we have a program to divest to reduce capital investment, and we achieved $300 million in that side of the ledger, so we'll continue with the same capital discipline done before. You can be assured of that. Morning Tom. Yes Tom - sorry, I was trying to get my mask off. We're expecting China to take about 25 million tons of corn, so you know the situation there in China - we think that inventories are much--reserves are much lower than what the market is reporting there. You can see that in the prices that we've seen. China didn't have a great crop, so we expect significant imports for both oilseeds and corn. Yes, we think so, we think so. Of course, not all comes from the U.S., it comes from different sources, but it is. China is trying other things as well - you know, they are reducing a little bit their wheat stocks, they have imported a lot of wheat from Australia as well. Remember that all this is driven by the recovery from ASF - they are trying to rebuild the curve, but also by the professionalization of the feeding that has included much more of all these grains into Russia. We think that we will continue to see multi-year increases in China's appetite for all these commodities. Yes, they have different dynamics. Human nutrition is much more related to specific innovation projects that are driven by customers in our pipeline, and we feel very strongly about that. Our pipeline continues to grow and our win rates continue to grow. Animal nutrition has been a little bit more affected by COVID in the sense that there are some parts of it, like aquaculture, where fish and shrimp are much more consumed in restaurants than at home, while on the other hand pet, with people spending more time at home, companion animals have become a little bit better. I would say there are puts and takes there, and it's difficult to judge ahead of time. I think the important thing about the nutrition business is when you take a look at what's happening, is that that's a business that is investing in growth but also has been able to grow returns and to grow margins within the year in both divisions, both in animal and in human nutrition. I think we're going to continue to see that with, as I said, the different paths to growth with animal nutrition more in building organic growth for some of the projects, especially in Asia and in parts of Latin America, and then in human nutrition with more specific customer innovation projects in North America and Europe. Thank you Tom. Yes, I would say the harvesting continues. These plants that we built are relatively new plants, whether it's pea protein or specialty proteins in Campo Grande, so we're going to have harvesting for many years down the road, hopefully. I would say that 2021 is a year of heavier investment, if you will, again another round of investment. Some of those things are capabilities, whether it's customer insights and marketing, whether it's new digital connections to customers, new models to innovate virtually, and even a lot of organic growth. We have--we kind of went light in organic growth projects in animal nutrition during 2020 because we were working on the synergies and, to be honest, because the COVID environment didn't allow for a lot of project work. Now, we are going into more of that, so you're going to see 2021 being a little bit heavier investment in that, in capabilities and plant. Some of these, you don't see because this is building the foundations. We are a science based nutrition company, but you see for example in the quarter, we got two awards. We got the FIE Award for Innovation in Pea Protein, and we got the BIG Innovation Award for BPL1, one of our probiotics. We continue to invest in science, in customer insights and in organic growth in this business as we harvest, and the harvesting you see in how our ROIC continues to grow in that business and you see the success of our value proposition in how the EBITDA margins continue to grow in our business.  We are very happy, but Eric, we are at the early stages of building the best nutrition company out there. We are probably halfway through that build. Yes, we see an environment of real demand, real effective demand happening out there, and to be honest, our customers don't have a lot of inventory because everybody has been talking of going hand to mouth with this inverse, so we see truly strong demand and tight balance sheets. As you said, corn and oilseeds, I think they're going to touch [indiscernible] balance sheet. Wheat is a little bit stronger, but the Black Sea has not had a great wheat season, although Australia has a wheat growing season, so we see this is going to take 18 to 24 months for these supply-demand balances to be rebuilt. We see these conditions persisting for the next couple of years, even with farmers, imagine like you, trying to plant more, because I think that these prices will bring more acres into production. But we need those extra acres right now. Right. Thank you Eric. Yes, something that you have to understand, and I'm going to speak at a high level here, but the nutrition has a different OP to capital sensitivity than the other businesses. These projects are--sometimes you have big projects like Campo Grande for specialty proteins, but the rest of the projects, if you think that the commodity business has maybe a multiplier of you need five units of capex to get one unit of OP, sometimes in nutrition you get a one-on-one. I think the issue is that because it's a smaller business, sometimes this investment, this effort has a higher impact in the P&L because they need to carry as they grow and as they build the smaller business. But I would say the nutrition is not a heavy capital intensive business, so when you hear me speaking about animal nutrition organic growth projects, those are small projects. They are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars type of projects, so I would say we continue to emphasize them but it's not a heavy burden on the capital. That's why we're growing so fast and we still are not forecasting north of a billion dollars, even when we're doing One ADM and all that. I think it's very affordable growth from a capital perspective. I think--listen, exports to China, we've been talking a lot about that. We expect this year will be a record high, so they are taking because, you know, corn is expensive in China. You also need to remember in this equation, sugar prices are at an all-time high, so in Brazil you make a choice, so it's different than the U.S., in Brazil you make a choice how much you make of sugar and ethanol, and of course sugar prices are a big temptation this year. We expect higher exports and maybe we expect a little bit of less pressure from Brazil in that sense."

            "name": "Ray Young",
            "content": "Yes, thanks Juan, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide No. 4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.21, down from the $1.42 in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of last year was positively impacted by the recognition of about $0.61 per share for the retroactive biodiesel tax credits. Absent this, earnings would have grown by about 49%. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.7%, almost 200 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC, and our trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.7 billion.  The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 8% compared to a benefit of 1% in the prior year. The calendar year 2020 effective tax rate was approximately 5%, down from the approximately 13% in 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and the impact of U.S. tax credits, mainly the railroad tax credits, which have an offsetting expense in the cost of products sold. Absent the effect of EPS-adjusting items, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 11%, and for the calendar year 2020, it was approximately 9%. Looking ahead, we're expecting full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.  We generated about $3.1 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the year, significantly higher than 2019. Return of capital for the year was $942 million, including more than $800 million from dividends.  We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 32%, up from the 29% a year ago due to higher working capital needs due to rising commodity prices. Capital spending for the year was about $820 million, in line with our guidance and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion dollars. For 2021, we expect capital spending to be in a range of $900 million to $1 billion. Slide 5, please. Other business results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter. ADM investor services earnings were impacted by drastically lower short-term interest rates. Captive insurance results were negatively impacted by $15 million more in net intra-company settlements compared to the prior year quarter. For 2021, we expect other business results to be in line with 2020. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $278 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, increased IT and project-related expenses, and centralization of certain costs, including from Neovia. Other charges decreased due to lower railroad maintenance expenses partially offset by the absence of prior year investment gains. For 2021, corporate unallocated should be overall similar to 2020. Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than last year due to lower short term interest rates and liability management actions taken in 2020. For 2021, we expect net interest expense for the calendar year to be similar to or slightly lower than 2020. Slide 6, please. The ag services and oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year with record adjusting operating profit in the fourth quarter. Ag services results were significantly higher year over year. In North America, the team executed extremely well, capitalizing on strong global demand particularly from China to deliver higher export volumes and margins. South American origination was lower year over year after significantly accelerated farmer selling in the first half of 2020.  Global trade continued to do a great job, contributing to higher results by utilizing its global reach and managing risk well to meet customer demand. Approximately $80 million of prior timing effects reversed in the quarter, as expected.  Crushing also delivered substantially higher results versus the prior year period. The business did a great job to capture higher margins in a continued environment of tight soybean supply and strong global demand for both meal and vegetable oils. There was approximately $125 million in net negative timing in the quarter driven by basis impacts and improved soft seed margins.  Refined products and other results were higher year over year absent the recognition of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year, with good results driven primarily by solid South American margins. Wilmar's strong performance drove our equity earnings higher versus the prior year despite our slightly lower ownership stake.  For the full year, ag service and oilseeds delivered exceptional results of $2.1 billion, 9% higher than 2019. The team achieved multiple records, including all-time high global crush volumes. In addition, we're proud of the team that brought our reserve export facility back online safely and ahead of schedule despite dealing with multiple severe weather events this year. Looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 results for ag service and oilseeds to be significantly higher than the prior year first quarter, driven by extremely strong North America export demand and continued healthy crush margins. Slide 7, please. The carbohydrate solutions team again delivered substantially a higher year-over-year result despite the impacts of lockdowns in key market segments. The starches and sweeteners sub-segment achieved significantly higher results driven by lower net corn costs and intra-company insurance settlements. Earnings were partially offset by low results from corn oil and wet mill ethanol margins. Damaged corn processor results were also better versus the prior year, though they continue to reflect the challenging ethanol industry environment. The team delivered higher year-over-year margins as they met increased demand for USP-grade alcohol, partially offset by fixed costs from the two temporarily idled dry mills.  Considering the impact of lockdowns in both driving miles and the food service sectors, we're extremely proud of our carbohydrate solutions team for delivering full year results of $717 million, 11% higher than 2019. The team achieved record high operating profits from starches in the year. They acted decisively by temporarily idling production at our two VCP dry mill plants, helping address industry supply and demand balances, and the wheat milling business' modernization and optimization plan, including a new state of the art mill in Mendota, Illinois, helped power a significant improvement over full year 2019 for that business.  Looking ahead, we expect carbohydrate solutions results in the first quarter to be significantly higher than last year's first quarter, which was negatively impacted by corn oil mark to market impacts, but below the fourth quarter 2020 levels due to the challenged industry ethanol margins.  Slide 8, please. The nutrition team delivered 24% year-over-year growth in the quarter. In human nutrition, flavors delivered a strong quarter driven by good sales and product mix in North America and EMEAI. Continued strength in plant proteins drove higher results in specialty ingredients. Health and wellness delivered higher sales in probiotics and natural health and nutrition. Prior year results included revenue and income related to the launch of the strategic Spiber relationship. Human nutrition results for the quarter also included an intra-company insurance settlement.  Animal nutrition results were significantly higher year over year, driven by strong performances in Asia and EMEAI and improvements in amino acid results, partially offset by currency effects in Latin America. We're continuing to make improvements in our amino acid business, including our announcement last month that we're discontinuing dry lysine production and transitioning to our liquid and encapsulated products in the first half of this year.  For the full year, nutrition results were $574 million, 37% higher than 2019. The nutrition team grew revenue 5% on a constant currency basis and continued to expand EBITDA margins. We exceeded our Neovia synergy targets and delivered them ahead of schedule. We are truly seeing the benefits of our investments in nutrition. Looking ahead, we expect nutrition to solidly grow operating profits in 2021 calendar year, but the first quarter should be similar to the prior year period due to timing of certain expenses over the year, including investments in projects to drive organic growth.  With that, let me turn it over to Juan to conclude. Juan? Yes Michael, it's Ray here. This is in the crush part of the ag services and oilseeds. As you pointed out, we increased by $125 million in the quarter, so now we have a balance of about $295 million in timing effects. We expect that roughly half will get reversed in the first quarter based upon the book that we have right now, and then the other half will be reversed over the second and third quarters and actually we'll see how prices move, but this is our current expectations in terms of how we expect this to play out over the course of '21. Morning Adam. Yes, sure Adam. Let me start here.  It's useful to refer to also how they manage 2020, right, because 2020, when you think about businesses that have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19, the carb sol segment was the one most negatively impacted, yet in 2020 they grew earnings. What they did was they really managed product mix extremely well - you know, driving starches, driving industrial alcohol. They managed the ethanol production well and frankly had a positive impact on industry margins through the idling actions it took. But what a lot of people forget is we have an international business that's growing, right so we're expanding capacity over in Europe, and the European operations almost doubled in profitability in 2020 compared to 2019, a big contributor there. In the North America milling operations, their footprint optimization is really paying off with 20% growth in profitability in '20 versus '19, so when you think about 2021, this playbook continues. Number one, we do expect stabilizations in the North American starches and sweetener business as the beginnings of recovery in demand for certain products occur with the dissipation of lockdowns. Secondly, they're continuing to drive great product portfolio mix, so particularly in the area of liquid dextrose and maltodextrin and citric acid. Those are actually, from a product mix perspective, very beneficial. Thirdly, continued international growth, so when you think about where sugar prices are around the world right now, our European operations, whereby we've added capacity, continues to drive growth, they're going to be another contributor. Then lastly, we expect continued growth in terms of our milling operations, and very pleased in terms of how their optimization plan is really playing out. Now getting back to some of the comments on the year-over-year comparison, we start off the year with weaker margins in ethanol, but if you recall in last year, margins actually hit a low of negative $0.45 in March. We don't see that, so when you think about year-over-year comparisons, we're going to start off on a challenged basis but we do expect the industry supply-demand balances in the ethanol industry get better balance as we move through the year, for several reasons. Number one, China actually has been buying U.S. ethanol. That's something that they have not been doing over the past couple of years, and we believe that they've already made commitments already in the first half of the year for U.S. ethanol equal to the previous all-time high for the calendar year, roughly 200 million gallons. We'll have to see where China ends up in the calendar year in terms of imports of U.S. ethanol.  Secondly, there has been announced reconfiguration of ethanol capacity by various competitors in the industry as they kind of focus their production away from transportation fuel ethanol towards other products, so that's going to have an impact in industry supply and demand. Thirdly, the industry itself, there is about 10% to 15% of capacity that remains idled, and from our perspective we're going to remain very disciplined in terms of when we actually re-start the dry mills because we'll want to see sustainable margins before we re-start, and hopefully sometime in the first half we're going to see that. Then lastly, how the small refinery exemptions will play out over the first part of the year as the Supreme Court rules on it will have an impact, frankly, in terms of domestic demand for ethanol. If you take a look at RINs pricing right now, there is an expectation in the U.S. that domestic ethanol demand is going to be strong over the course of this calendar year, given just a recovery in terms of driving miles as we go through the year and then, secondly, how the expectations in terms of how the SREs will play out. Overall, Adam, we feel good about how we start the year in terms of the carb solutions businesses, but we do see particularly in the area of ethanol, we see green shoots of recovery in 2021 for this business here. Well, we finished the year actually from a leverage perspective on a debt to EBITDA ratio in reasonable position because, as you know, inventory financing from a rating agency perspective, you get RMI credit, so with the movement in higher commodity prices which moved working capital higher, clearly we're financing it. One of the things very different than the last crisis back in 2008 is that we've really diversified our working capital lines, and so I feel good about our ability to finance a higher working capital level. But from a leverage perspective with the RMI credits, our leverage--our balance sheet remains strong, and so we believe we've got fire power in order to continue to look at opportunistic M&A and opportunistic share buybacks over the course of the year. Morning Ben. Yes, a lot of it is going to be a function of where ethanol moves over the course of the year. We expect it to be over $100 million. We expect it to be over $100 million, but where we land, a lot of it will be where ethanol moves over the next couple months here. But again, if you recall last year, we had about $65 million of negative corn oil market to market that won't get repeated, so that's going to be a benefit in our first quarter results this year. Thank you. Yes Rob, it's Ray here. A couple things to note. First of all, the team did an outstanding job on risk management, so without disclosing everything that they do, it's fair to say that we had a lot of our requirements for 2021 hedged before the significant run-up in terms of corn costs. I think that the team did some great work in terms of anticipating how S&Ds would actually work over the course of 2021. With respect to contracts, just a reminder not every contract gets negotiated in the contract cycle. We have multi-year contracts, and so a certain amount of contracts got negotiated and the outcome of the negotiations is the fact that we expect to be able to maintain our margins as we go through 2021 relative to 2020, through a combination of contract negotiations as well as the efforts that we're doing in terms of managing the mix and also managing our costs there. The other comment in terms of rising corn costs, and also given really a strong demand environment for feed, is you've seen cold product values go up. That's a benefit for our businesses as well, so I think in the fourth quarter we made the comment that part of the strong results is that we had very favorable net corn costs. We expect that the team is also going to be able to manage through '21 with good net corn cost as well, so I think the team--and the carb sol team, they've done an outstanding job on the risk management side in managing through the higher corn cost environment here. I think, Rob, let's keep it to the fact that we've been able to manage in total the portfolio, the contracts and being able to maintain the margins year over year. That's the level of disclosure I think we want to make at this point. Thank you. Ken, a couple things on the increased capex. One, I mentioned that we are in the midst of a business transformation program, so 2021 will be one of our peak years into a project, the One ADM project, so we do have some capitalized--some incremental capitalized costs associated with the program that's part of our capex budget. Secondly, with the pandemic in 2020, some projects got moved over, got pushed from 2020 into 2021. Some of them are growth projects, some of them are cost reduction projects, some of them are non-discretionary expenditure projects, so there's a series of projects that we did push from 2020 to '21 just due to the pandemic and our ability to execute.  Then thirdly, we do have growth projects. We mentioned organic growth, our focus in that area, so we do have organic growth projects going on in the course of 2021. Those are the three buckets as to why the number is increasing from the number that we finished up in '20 from '21.  Again, the range, $900 million to $1 billion is a large range. We haven't approved some of these projects, we're just putting it in terms of a placeholder, but part of our discipline is we will be evaluating the timing, the returns, and determining do we actually spend it in the course of '21 or not. As you know, in terms of growth projects, our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages, right? Our hurdle rates are double-digit percentages in order to approve these projects. You're referring to the $295 million of timing effects, Ken? It's all included there. It's all included in the number there, Ken - all included. There's a lot of puts and takes there, Ken, right, so I think it's fair to say that our pre-tax numbers are going to grow significantly and there is going to be a little--you take a little bit off with the higher tax rate. I think that's probably the more important factor, is our higher tax rate will skim off a little bit of the pre-tax improvement that we're going to drive in '21 versus '20. Thank you Eric. There's a couple, Ben. There's a couple large projects in the carb solutions business that we're finishing up in 2021, so the Bulgaria expansion, we're finishing up, we're finishing up the building of the feed health in Clinton, so there's a couple of chunky investments that we're just finishing up over the course of '21."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\n I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Victoria de la Huerga, Vice President Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. de la Huerga, you may begin. \nVictoria Huerga: Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's third quarter earnings webcast. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's webcast will be available at adm.com.\n For those following the presentation, please turn to Slide 2, the company's safe harbor statement, which says that some of our comments and materials constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results as well as the drivers of our performance and our outlook. Vince Macciocchi, Senior Vice President and President of our Nutrition segment, will give an update on our nutrition business and its future growth. Then Juan will make some final comments, after which they will take your questions.\n Please turn to Slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan. \nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Victoria. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.89, up from $0.77 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted segment operating profit was $849 million, up 11% year-over-year, and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 8.3%.\n Our strategic initiatives have continued to enable our teams around the world to demonstrate their expertise and skills. And I'm proud of how our colleagues are supporting customers and driving strong results. The team has done a great job handling the daily and sometimes hourly challenges that have come our way in 2020. That resiliency allows us to deliver outstanding results today while we simultaneously continue our strategic work to make our company better and advance our growth and transformation.\n Let me share with you some of our accomplishments. In our optimize pillar, our Ag Services and Oilseeds team continued its work to enhance returns, delivering another $100 million in invested capital reductions in the third quarter. Since 2017, Ag Services and Oilseeds has improved its capital position by exiting from no longer strategic assets, including 71 grain origination locations, 6 oilseed facilities, 14 Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts locations and 7 ocean-going vessels.\n We've also seen first-hand how our improvement initiatives have helped drive business continuity. In addition to the pandemic, in recent months, we've seen multiple hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf under the rage of storm that swept across the Midwest. Despite those events, thanks to our teams and our operational excellence, we have continued to serve our customers and fulfill our purpose without significant interruption.\n In our drive pillar, we are continuing to accelerate our 1ADM business transformation, expanding the deployment of our procurement, contract labor and sales and marketing modules, which are helping us drive efficiencies and growth and will provide us with a trove of data to support enhanced analytics and decision-making.\n Our Decatur corn complex ongoing strong performance from grind to gluten and germ meal to workplace safety continues to demonstrate the benefits of our centralized operations organization. Our supply chain center of excellence is delivering as well. Using our enhanced processes and tools as well as integrated planning between commercial, supply chain and operations, we've recently piloted changes at the nutrition facility that are on track to unlock a 20-plus percent increase in production capacity at that location and have already resulted in enhancements in customer service without additional capital spending. We'll be rolling these kinds of improvements out to other locations.\n In our expand pillar, we are continuing to harvest our investments. For example, year-to-date, our Algar Agro acquisition has tripled its year-over-year operating profit. In a very short time, Algar has grown to be an important component of the South American business. We've successfully expanded production of high-quality USP grade alcohol in Peoria and Clinton to meet high demand for hand sanitizer. We announced the construction of a new state-of-the-art production facility in Spain that will dramatically expand our ability to meet growing demand for probiotics and other consumer products to support health and wellness.\n We also signed a long-term agreement with Japanese startup Spiber Inc. This project taps into our innovative spirit and capabilities creating value from across our supply chain from the corn we buy to the dextrose we make, to the science and manufacturing technology we have invested in. And it meets a critical need in the marketplace for both consumer and industrial products that come from sustainable sources.\n Our transformation and growth and our confidence in the future will not be possible without readiness. By the end of the third quarter, our team identified and executed on readiness initiatives that unlocked almost $1.2 billion in run rate benefits. And now I'm pleased to announce that we are on track to achieve $1.3 billion by the end of the year.\n Readiness encompasses and supports our entire company. It drives the strategic imperatives that help us fulfill our purpose, such as sustainability. We are advancing our sustainability efforts on many fronts, such as our Strive 35 goals to improve our performance on greenhouse gases, energy, water and waste.\n Readiness creates growth enablers. For example, we're continuing to elevate our commercial excellence with innovative tools like our consumer insight programs and virtual customer technologies. And of course, readiness is one of the key elements powering the growth algorithm we laid out at the beginning of the year. Because of its success, along with tremendous progress in our harvest and improved initiatives, we now expect to meet or exceed the high end of our $500 million to $600 million goal for targeted improvement in 2020.\n So before I turn to Ray, I'd like to say that it's our pleasure to welcome Vince today on this call. In 2014, we started a new journey with the acquisition of WILD Flavors and the launch of a full-service nutrition business, offering customers a broad array of products and services. I could not be more proud of the growth we have seen since then.\n Nutrition has delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year OP growth. Revenue is up 5.7% on a currency-adjusted basis for the first 9 months of the year. And in the years since we acquired WILD, we are nearly tripled OP in the flavors business. As we've been getting more and more questions about that business and its growth potential, we decided that it was the perfect time to update and explain the business further.\n But before we get to Vince though, I'll turn it over to Ray to take us through our business performance. Ray? \nRay Young: Thanks, Juan. And please turn to Slide #4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.89, up from the $0.77 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $849 million, up 11%. And our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 8.3%, 255 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC. Our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.7 billion.\n Our cash flows are strong as we generate about $2.3 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the first 9 months of the year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was a benefit of approximately 13% compared to an expense of 19% in the prior year. Our Q3 tax rate was impacted by our debt retirement actions as well as the sale of our Wilmar shares and higher year-over-year Wilmar earnings and U.S. tax credits. Absent the effect of EPS adjusting items, our effective tax rate was approximately 11%. We expect our adjusted tax rate for Q4 to be similar to this adjusted Q3 effective tax rate.\n As we announced at various points during Q3, we've taken several actions over the last few months to both utilize and enhance our strong balance sheet. These actions were not about cash flow or liquidity as we had cash and available credit capacity at the end of the quarter of almost $10 billion. They were about creating balance sheet optionality for future transactions while maintaining a strong credit rating profile.\n We monetized a portion of our Wilmar investment through a block sale of Wilmar stock and issuance of bonds exchangeable for Wilmar shares at a future date. As we have indicated, we view our significant remaining Wilmar stake as strategic, and we do not have any intentions to sell additional shares.\n Leveraging our strong cash position, we also rebalanced our mix between long and short-term debt, economically retiring higher coupon debt through positive NPV transactions and reducing interest payments in the future.\n Combined, these actions allow us the flexibility to make strategic investments, further bolt-on acquisitions or buy back shares when it makes sense to do so, all while continuing to make progress in deleveraging our balance sheet and maintaining our single A credit ratings. These actions were also a significant driver of our tax rate.\n Return of capital for the first 9 months was $724 million, including around $115 million in opportunistic share repurchases, the vast majority of which were executed earlier this year. We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 27%, down from the 30% a year ago.\n Capital spending for the first 9 months was about $560 million. We expect capital spending for the year to be around $800 million that we previously indicated and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion.\n Slide 5, please. Other business results were lower than the prior year quarter, driven by lower ADM investor services earnings and captive insurance underwriting losses, including a $17 million settlement impact for the high water claim with Ag Services and Oilseeds.\n In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $196 million were higher year-over-year, due primarily to variable performance-related incentive compensation accruals, which were low in the prior year. Corporate results this quarter also included $396 million related to the early debt retirement charges that I referred to earlier, which is an EPS adjustment item. Net interest expense for the quarter was similar to the prior year period.\n Looking forward, we expect unallocated corporate expenses to be in line with our initial $800 million guidance for calendar year and Q4 net interest expense to be slightly lower than Q3. We also expect a loss of about $50 million in other business in Q4 due to anticipated intercompany insurance claim settlements.\n Please turn to Slide 6. Ag Services and Oilseeds results were higher than the third quarter of 2019. In Ag Services, we saw extremely good execution around the globe. The North American team did well to capitalize on strong industry export margins and volumes, and the global trade team had another strong quarter as they continued their focus on serving customers. Ag Services also benefit from a $54 million settlement related to the 2019 U.S. high water insurance claims, which is partially offset by an expense in captive insurance.\n The crushing team also did a great job executing in a solid demand environment. Both Ag Services and Crushing saw expanding margins during the quarter resulting in around $155 million in total negative timing effects, which led to lower results. Those timing impacts are expected to reverse in the coming quarters. Refined Products and Other was significantly higher year-over-year, driven by improved biodiesel margins around the globe. Equity earnings from Wilmar were substantially higher versus the prior year period.\n Looking ahead, we expect to see strong North American exports in global crush margins in the fourth quarter, combined to contribute to a very strong Ag Services and Oilseeds performance, with results significantly higher than the third quarter of this year, though lower than Q4 of 2019, which included a $270 million benefit for 2 years of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit.\n Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were significantly higher year-over-year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment was substantially higher driven by strong risk management and improved net corn costs as well as a balanced ethanol industry supply and demand environment. Reduced food service demand affected sweetener and flower volumes but we're seeing good demand recovery for starches in North America. The Vantage corn processors team did a good job executing on the wet mill fuel ethanol distribution and capitalizing on higher year-over-year industry margins while managing the fixed costs from the 2 temporarily idle dry mills. Increased volumes and margins on USP grade industrial alcohol to support the hand sanitizer market also contributed to higher year-over-year profits.\n Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions to be close to Q3 of this year and substantially higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by improved year-over-year fuel ethanol margins and higher industrial-grade sales. While Sweetener and Flower volumes will still be impacted by weaker food service demand, we expect the year-over-year percentage decline to be smaller than it was in Q3.\n On Slide 8, Nutrition delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year profit growth. Human nutrition results were substantially higher versus the prior year quarter, with strength across the entire pantry, including flavors, plant-based proteins and probiotics. Animal Nutrition was also higher year-over-year, driven by continued delivery of Neovia synergies, strengthened livestock and year-over-year improvement in amino acids, partially offset by softer aquaculture feed demand as well as negative foreign currency impacts. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect nutrition to deliver another quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year OP growth with a typically seasonally weaker Q4 in Human Nutrition, offset by seasonally stronger Animal Nutrition.\n I'd now like to transition to Vince Macciocchi, President of our Nutrition business, for an update and overview of the business. Vince, congratulations to you and your team for not just a great quarter but for consistent delivery of strong growth. \nVincent Macciocchi: Thank you, Ray. Slide 9, please. I'm proud of the team who have delivered in so many ways. When I reflect upon the growth we've made and the journey we are still taking, I keep coming back to our purpose, to unlock the power of nature, to enrich the quality of life. I think it's remarkable how these few words sum up not just what we do but why our work is so important.\n The global population is growing, and consumer behavior is shifting in ways we couldn't have predicted only 10 or 15 years ago. The scale of the change and the opportunity for ADM is enormous. Global sales of specialty ingredients across both human and animal nutrition are as much as $85 billion and growing at a rate of 5% to 7% per year. These specialty ingredients, which represent the majority of the nutrition portfolio aside from fee, go into the full array of consumer nutrition products for humans and animals, many of which are projected to grow significantly in the coming years.\n For example, the global market for functional beverages could be as large as $190 billion in 2024. The global dietary supplement market could be worth more than $77 billion in that same time frame. Global retail sales of alternative proteins are already a $25 billion market today, with a projected growth rate of 14% per year. Global retail sales of pet food are projected to grow at 4% per year, reaching $120 billion by 2024.\n These aren't just numbers. They're indicators of significant long-term trends in how people choose food, drink and other products, driven by a global population that cares deeply about health and sustainability. And based upon the portfolio, footprint, capabilities and talent we've built, no other company is positioned to meet these needs and lead in these industries like ADM.\n Please turn to Slide 10. It's been 6 years since we started on this journey. In that time, we built or expanded more than 16 facilities, from our pea protein complex in the U.S. through our network of premix plants in China. We've enhanced our science and technology capabilities, invested in market research and consumer insights and built new interactive ways to engage with customers from our more than 50 global customer innovation centers to daily virtual innovation and tasting sessions. We've made platform acquisitions, and we've added bolt-ons. All in all, we have invested just over $6 billion to build our global leadership position in nutrition.\n These investments are delivering results. Since 2014, we've increased our annual revenue by $3 billion. And by the end of this year, we'll have grown operating profits by more than $300 million over those 6 years, more than double.\n Slide 11, please. Our Human Nutrition business can offer customers ingredients, flavor systems or turnkey product development solutions, supporting them every step of the way to take their ideas from concept to prototype to market in record time. In Animal Nutrition, only 1.5 years after we completed our Neovia acquisition, we can look back on a successful integration in which we exceeded our synergy goals and built a global business that offers a full portfolio of on-trend items, from pet treats to enzymes to ingredients for aquaculture to meet evolving customer needs.\n In our Health and Wellness business, which is part of our Human Nutrition subsegment, our scientists are expanding the universe of pro-, pre- and postbiotics and other functional products to meet growing demand, from stand-alone supplements to ingredients that help enhance our array of human and animal solutions.\n Taken together, our extremely broad portfolio of ingredients and solutions can add value for customers across both human and animal nutrition. For instance, taste and color are just as important for animal nutrition customers today, as they are for food and beverage customers. Functional ingredients matter in both human and animal nutrition and so on across our entire pantry.\n Then we add the rest of ADM's capabilities. In plant-based protein, for example, we have the unique advantage of ADM's broad and integrated value chain, from sourcing and transporting the soybeans and peas to transforming them into high-protein ingredients at our own facilities, to adding the colors, flavors, oils and other key elements to create just the right taste, appearance, juiciness and sizzle for delicious finished plant-based products.\n Please turn to Slide 12. We're proud to have come this far in 6 short years, but our eye is on the future. We are confident in continuing our growth story. It starts with the global category trends I outlined earlier. It continues with our extensive and ongoing research into consumer behavior and needs.\n Earlier this week, we released our latest view of the top consumer trends of 2021 based upon research that includes our proprietary outside voice consumer insights program. Our findings show that the events of the past year are accelerating and deepening fundamental market shifts, including consumers taking a more proactive approach to nourishing body and mind, the microbiome as the gateway to wellness, continued growing demand for plant-based foods, sustainability as a key driver of purchasing decisions and transparency as a building block of consumer trust.\n The last piece of the equation is how our team brings it all together for our customers, combining unmatched customer support and service with our vast value chain to deliver ingredients, systems and solution that align perfectly with market trends and needs. These are the reasons we expect to continue to lead the industry outpacing the market and operating profit growth, and we remain confident in reaching $1 billion in OP in the medium-term future.\n With that, I'll turn it back to Juan. \nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vince. And congratulations to you and the entire ADM team for another outstanding quarter.\n Slide 13, please. Across the enterprise, we are continuing to advance our work to enrich the quality of life and meet key needs for consumers around the globe. At the time of heightened concerns around food security, ADM's vast global value chain is helping ensure that countries and families can continue to put nutritious, delicious foods on the table. As consumers focus more and more on proactive approaches to health, we're expanding the frontier in groundbreaking functional ingredients and supplements for people with conditions like migraine and atopic dermatitis, and we're paving the way to a new world of precision nutrition personalized for every individual. And as sustainability becomes a key driver of consumer decisions and business success, we're playing a leading role in the transition to a low-carbon economy for our industry.\n We are committed to our purpose, and our team is continuing to deliver for our customers, our shareholders and all could depend on us. And that is why we are confident in a strong finish to 2020 and a positive momentum continuing through 2021.\n With that, Amy, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Seaport Global. \nEric Larson: Congratulations on a really good quarter. My first question is really for Vince. Vince, thank you for that review of your operation. And I'm going back to Slide 11 and going to your complete pantry of ingredients and solutions from nature. So we've seen some pretty massive consolidation in this industry now the last several years with IFF making some very large acquisitions at extraordinary multiples.\n Can you give us just a little flavor for, if you look at the various categories where you've got your pantry, what your shares are in those areas, roughly? I know it's highly fragmented. Where additional opportunity might be available for you -- outside of your normal organic growth, I mean would there be some opportunities to strengthen your portfolio across those various sectors? And where do you think your biggest strengths are? And maybe where you could use some strengthening in those areas? \nVincent Macciocchi: Thank you, Eric. I think if you think about our business -- and maybe I'll start kind of where you finished in terms of some of our greatest strengths. I think our greater strengths are obviously the breadth and depth of the pantry coupled with our technical capabilities and providing solutions backed by science. I think you also marry that with the global consumer trends when you think about the focus on the microbiome, focus on plant-based foods, sustainability and good for you, and you think about clean label moving to clear label.\n Our portfolio is really well positioned when you think about our flavors business and the focus on natural and our continued growth in the mature market and as we expand our footprint into the emerging markets.\n Specialty ingredients, obviously, we have a dominant share as a key protein -- plant-based protein provider. And we're providing soy, pea and wheat from a plant-based protein perspective and really capitalizing on that global consumer trend.\n If you look at our Health and Wellness business, we have a fantastic portfolio, really focused on probiotics and postbiotics as well as fiber as well as vitamins as well as specialty oil, so a really complete portfolio across Health and Wellness.\n And then obviously in Animal Nutrition, we completed the acquisition of Neovia in 2019. Obviously, we've over-delivered against the synergy targets, but it's a global, robust business. It's really focused on, obviously, complete feed additives and ingredients, aquaculture, pet. So really moving that portfolio to realize synergies, grow organically and capitalize on our global footprint.\n So where is our opportunity? There's certainly opportunity to further expand in the flavors business into emerging markets. We're always looking at technology in our portfolio and geography, in the plant-based business and specialty ingredients. It's really making sure we're providing outside of the Americas and looking to enhance our footprint there.\n In Health and Wellness, it's really capitalizing on the microbiome and expanding our capability. Juan mentioned in his remarks that we're expanding our facility in Valencia, Spain. That will give us significant capacity increase to capitalize on our growing demand.\n And then on animal, I think our story is really one where we finish the integration, we grow organically, we margin up that portfolio, and we continue to combine all pieces of our portfolio and provide solutions backed by science. \nEric Larson: Okay. Great. And my follow-up question is really kind of -- is for Juan, and this is more of a general question. Juan, I think most of the people on this call are aware of the nice recovery in the global ag markets, et cetera. I think the question that we all have, and we've seen various fits and starts and stops and stall from the last several years. Can you address how you look at the sustainability of the recovery in these -- basically in the ag markets globally, aside from just the current strength that we're seeing? Clearly, it's sustainable in the early part of next year. But beyond that, do you -- can you give us your perspective on sustainability for the next let's say, 1 or 2 years or even more? \nJuan Luciano: Yes, Eric, thank you. I think -- listen, I think I'm very proud, first of all, of course, of the way the team has been executed. And I think we have a track record of consistent execution on that so that -- from that perspective. Second, I think the important thing to reflect upon is that we have built the business over these few years, aligned to secular trends on food security, on health and wellness and on sustainability. And we see those trends being with us for the duration that I can see going forward.\n So when we look at our planning horizon, we feel very good about that, about achieving our 10% ROIC, and we're achieving our goals in earnings and reduction on invested capital. When we look at the -- even the issues that we're seeing today with the pandemic, the pandemic has basically increased or emphasized some of the trends that we have been already developing over time with the consumers. And you see governments more concerned about food security now and the ability to keep supplying food for the world. And I think that we are a key element in that. And our footprint and our ability to connect the areas of surplus with areas of deficit in the world is valued and is recognized and I think that, that will continue going forward.\n I think that everything that we're doing in terms of positioning our portfolio for healthier trends. We see the reaction on that. We see the reaction in plant-based proteins. We see the reaction in probiotics, but we see the reaction also on the snacking in functional foods. And all that is very strong in the ADM portfolio. And we continue to see the pool from biomaterials, from materials based on plant that actually replaces other fossil fuel type of build materials that have more push. So we see it in the scale and the reach that we have for food security. We see it in the specialization that we see in nutrition, and we see it in the demand for sustainability.\n So as far as we can tell, again, we are finishing the year very strong with the Q4 that we are very excited about, and we are entering Q1 with a strong momentum. So we certainly see 2021 with a lot of optimism. I think conditions are there for us to have good times, and we don't see at this point in time what is the thing that will change that. Demand is strong. I think if anything, China has come rolling back from the pandemic. Their recovery has surprised everybody. At the same time that the economy recovers, they are recovering from ASF, which they are rebuilding their herds. At the time when, candidly, Brazil has sold -- because we were part of that, has sold all the pipeline of beans in which Argentina doesn't have an incentive to sell. And for the very first time in a long time, the world needs the U.S. supply for both soybeans and corn.\n So we are looking at it from several angles, to be honest, and we see it fine. We see also, even in the crush margins that is a crush supported by both legs now. Traditionally, it has been more on the mill side, but we have a very big oil story developing around the world and it has all these conditions. Whether it's biodiesel or renewable green diesel or just the recovery of food service, we have been pulling oil demand.\n So again, at this point in time, we see the future with a lot of optimism and a lot of confidence in our team's ability to execute on that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with Baird. \nBen Kallo: So just you touched on ASF, but could you talk a little bit more about that and when we expect that to be a tailwind? Then my second question is just on the Wilmar and the liquidity from that. Where should we expect, I think, the investment to go and maybe a rank order there? And then third, we get -- we're hearing more and more all over the place about renewable diesel. Can you talk to us about your exposure to that trend as a tailwind? \nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Ben. So the first one, ASF. As we said, I think ASF, we've been following this story for several quarters. And I think that overall, it has developed as we predicted. So initially, with the big gap in protein in China that was supplemented by imports of proteins, and we saw that in the strength of crush margins. Now China has been able to control that. Now China is rebuilding their herd. Remember that herd was -- about half of the herd was decimated. So there is a big effort to rebuild that. As they rebuild the herd, they are going into more professional animal production. That has increased the rations. So -- that has increased soy meal, but that has increased corn. That's why you see so much pull from China from imported corn. At the same time, we have seen the poultry industry coming up in China to supplement a little bit the lack of pork protein that they have in China.\n So we've seen all that. We think that there's still probably a couple of years ahead of us for China to recover the herd plenty. And of course, you heard their statement about trying to go for self-sufficiency. So I think they're going to build that. So we're going to see continued strength in crush margins. And we feel that, that's driving demand.\n Again, as I said before, the professionalization of the animal husbandry has brought more soybean meal and corn into the ration, and we will continue to see better feeding and better nutrition in that sense. So again, nothing surprising maybe to what we expected.\n And remember that in the previous quarter, we talked about our positive view of crush margins over the second half of the year. And that's the way we predicted, that's the way we played, and that's the way it is working out. So -- and China is behind a lot of that.\n Your second question was on Wilmar and our allocation of capital. Listen, Wilmar, we are very proud of the Wilmar ownership and relationship that we have had for many years. It's a very strategic partner for us, which gave us last night, another gift with great results. The team continues to execute. And again, it's a little bit related to what I'm saying. China has come in rolling back from the pandemic and the recovery and Wilmar is a big part of that.\n We made a reallocation of capital decision. Again, we're going to hold to our 20% share there. We are very comfortable and committed to that for the long term. This was just a matter of we wanted to strengthen our balance sheet after the acquisitions, you heard Vince, between WILD Flavors and Neovia. We need to get back to that. I mean we are comfortable into that. And we want to get back to support Vince with the bolt-ons that he needs and some organic investments. We are increasing the capacity as we announced in Biopolis by fivefold, where things are growing there. And I'm sure Vince has a long list of bolt-ons that he wants to execute, another organic growth as we grow geographically some of the successes that we have in North America and Europe.\n So that basically is nothing behind that other than that. And we continue to support R&D. You talked about a lot -- you heard Vince talking a lot about science-based functional products and science-based nutrition. And that's important, and that takes money. So it's money that we gladly invest in that because we are seeing the returns on that. Not everybody has business in their segment that grow 5 consecutive quarters or more than 20% per quarter in terms of operating profit. So we are very proud with that.\n And your third question was about renewable green diesel? \nBen Kallo: Yes. \nJuan Luciano: Yes. And listen, we participate that as a supplier of feedstock. You see the tightening that this has generated because, of course, there has been stable volumes and very healthy margins of biodiesel that we've been supplying. And also, we've seen the tightness that, that generated as food service has recovered in the oil part of the consumption.\n So I think that we follow that with interest. It's another leg that adds to the strength of crush margins. So in the short term, it's a very positive tailwind. We have to see how that industry evolves. There are many factors in this industry. There are many announcements that they are all positive. That will put some pressure in feedstocks, of course. And we're going to see how that announced, how many states or countries adopt these, how many of these investments are actually come through into real plans and then how many other feedstocks are allowed here to come.\n Today, the environment of feedstock is a little bit of a rarefied environment because we have less of restaurants creating cooked oil and then we have a little bit of less production of -- in the ethanol side. So -- but we have potential to bring canola into these that we are -- it's a good carbon index also.\n So there are a lot of dynamics. But I think short term, we are participating just as a supplier of soybean oil and that we are profiting from that in the crush margins that we are seeing. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Theurer with Barclays Bank. \nBenjamin Theurer: Yes. Congrats on the results. I tried to get you back on schedule, ask only one question, and that one is for Vince. So when you nicely showed how you've basically increased the nutrition business since the bigger acquisition some 6 years ago, and if we look at it on a trailing basis, we're basically at about $550 million in operating profit, call it, somewhere halfway through of where you want to get. But we've clearly seen a significant acceleration in the last 2, 3 years.\n So how should we think about your path to the $1 billion going forward? Is this going to be a 6-year time to get there? Is it going to be accelerated just because of the flexibility? And as Juan just said, he's going to give you a little bit more capital and opportunities as you have a long list for bolt-on M&A. So how should we think about the growth performance M&A versus organic? And when do you think that medium-term target can be achieved? \nJuan Luciano: Yes. Maybe if I start, and I'll let Vince complete that with some more granularity. But when we look at our strategic plan, and we plan in 5-year increments, so the last one we did in 2019, so 2019 to 2024, we see our $1 billion OP that Vince described being achieved in that planning cycle. So let's say, by 2024, if you want to say it that way.\n In order to get there from here, you can see the nutrition approximately needs to grow around 15% per year compounded to get to that number. So that number is excluded any major M&A. That number is in the current strategy, which is organic growth and bolt on. So about the ratio that you're seeing right now going.\n So maybe then I pass it to Vince to provide more granularity on where that growth comes from. \nVincent Macciocchi: Thank you, Juan, and thank you, Ben. I think it's important if you just take a pause and see where we're at. If you look on a year-to-date basis through 3 quarters, we're at $448 million, whereas we did $419 million all of last year. So to Juan's point, it's a good growth story and a good growth trajectory from an organic basis. And what we've done is we've really taken the approach of let's grow organically. Let's expand our customer base. We've made significant investments in our key account management program and our approach to the customers and really expanding that base on a worldwide basis.\n As I mentioned in my remarks that we've invested over $6 billion in this business. So yes, we've done platform deals that we've integrated and then grown organically, and we've done a series of bolt-ons. But additionally, we've invested in our own facilities. We built a greenfield pea production facility in Enderlin. We built a soy protein complex in Campo Grande in Brazil. We've done acquisitions in the citrus space, the vanilla space, the food-based space, the bioactive space. And so obviously, we're harvesting those investments right now and continuing to take those businesses and grow those businesses and add them to our portfolio of capabilities. So I think that's what gives us some optimism. And we look at our win rate in the marketplace as well. And we look at our pipeline of opportunities.\n Again, when you take these capabilities and the size of the pantry which we depicted earlier, and you marry those with the technical capabilities we have on a worldwide basis from a science and technology perspective and a creation, design and development perspective, that translates to a very high win rate against customer opportunities that actually launched in the marketplace.\n Therefore, we have an organic growth road map as Juan identified within the time horizon of the strategic plan that will get us to that $1 billion aspiration. And again, we'll continue to search, as Juan indicated earlier, for smart bolt-ons and perhaps platform deals if and when they make sense. \nJuan Luciano: And then we're going to keep pushing Vince to get there faster. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nRobert Moskow: Juan, the environment looks great. I totally agree. I'm trying to think of things that might derail that situation. One investor asked me about Argentina and the possibility of devaluation. And would that be a catalyst for farmers selling, crushers crushing and leading to a glut in the market that might cause crush margins to fall? Can you comment on that possibility? \nJuan Luciano: Yes. Well, so I'm not going to be on record predicting a devaluation in Argentina, Rob, since I would like to go back one day, but let's put it this way. The world is tight today. There is a big demand, as I said, from China. And even if -- let's run your scenario in which Argentina devalue and there is an incentive for the farmer to sell. Then may be only like 5 million tons that they're going to throw into the market. To be honest, the market needs that, and the market will absorb that very quickly and move on.\n So I don't see that as a big source of derailment. I don't know what the source of derailment could be. But I don't worry that much about that. I think, again, the market is tight enough today. Brazil's crop is a couple of weeks late. So there is a La Ni\u00f1a effect that we still need to see what's going to do to yields. And although I think that Brazil, we have a big crop, I don't think we're going to have 140 million tons crop given the start and the conditions that there are.\n So I think that at this point in time, I worry more about where the beans and where the mill is going to come from later on than actually if Argentina will flood the market. We don't see that as an opportunity. If you hear -- I mean if you -- unfortunately, I don't have the opportunity to be back in Brazil or Argentina at this stage. But as I talked to Brazil, Brazil is an environment of -- in an environment of food inflation and imports right now, where they're bringing imports from Paraguay, from Uruguay for beans.\n So I think you see the need, and we see it with a customer base that is very uncovered, to be honest. So these are people that are buying hand to mouth for strong demand. And it's our role to supply that and to cover that. But as I said, we worry a little bit more about making sure that the flow from the farmers continue so we have the material to continue to execute and to feed the world. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. \nPooran Sharma: This is Pooran filling in for Ben. I just wanted to ask you how you're thinking about your dry mills. Does it seem like it makes more sense to just keep them offline until post-COVID? What do you think is best for that business? And can you talk about any growth you have or could see in USP grade alcohol? \nRay Young: Yes, it's Ray here. Well, first of all, we've done a very good job managing the stranded costs of our 2 temporarily idle dry mills. And I think also with some additional idlings that have occurred in the industry. I think the industry has done a very good job in terms of balancing supply and demand in the ethanol industry. And that's part of the reason why when you look at inventories right now, EIA count on stocks are below 20 million barrels. And that's contributed towards, frankly, a reasonable ethanol margin environment that we've seen. And that's contributed, frankly speaking towards good results that we've seen both in our Starches and Sweeteners segment, which has the wet mills, and then also for VCP, which has the industrial-grade alcohol of our Peoria facility.\n So we believe that as we kind of enter the winter season, which you know seasonally driving miles come down during the winter, and so therefore, from an ADM perspective, we believe we're probably going to keep these dry mills temporarily idled as we go through the low season of gasoline demand and hence ethanol demand. That's the responsible thing to do.\n Then -- but when we look forward into the new year, as I indicated in the last call, we're going to look at the data, right? And so we're going to look at the data with respect to how the U.S. economy is recovering. We're going to look at the data in terms of how driving miles are going to seasonally recover as well. We're going to look at the data in terms of the industry utilization rates for ethanol because some of these ethanol mills that we've seen idled, they're going to be permanently idled. Some of them -- a lot of them have indicated that they're going to remain permanently idled as opposed to temporarily idled. And then importantly, we're going to be looking on very -- the Tenth Circuit Court ruling on special refinery exemptions and whether the Supreme Court is going to hear the case or not.\n So there's a lot of variables that you're going to be looking at. In addition, you may have heard that China is also starting to look at potential imports of ethanol from United States into the country. I think there's been 1 boat that has gone to China. But they are making a lot of inquiries about U.S. ethanol. And so all of these variables are going to be very important factors in terms of our assessment in terms of when we actually restart these dry mills. Based upon any or all these variables becoming favorable, we could see that with the -- let's say, the spring season when normally the industry starts building up inventories of ethanol for the summer driving season, we could see that as we get into spring, that we may restart the dry mills again.\n But again, this will be a data-driven decision. We recognize the importance that we play in order to make sure we have good supply/demand balances in our industry. But again, looking at the variables, as we see it right now, we could -- we clearly see the path towards some sort of restart in the first half of next year. \nPooran Sharma: Got it. And then also, could you just maybe provide a little bit more color on the prospects for USP grade alcohol? \nRay Young: It's been a good news story, right? I mean we started the year with 1 plant, our Peoria plant, 85 million gallons a year. Demand shot through the roof for industrial-grade alcohol. And so we actually combination ran the plant hard plus we've expanded the capacity of that plant. So we'll be up to 100 million gallons very shortly. And then secondly, we also made some investments into another facility, Clinton, and we're going to actually expand production of industrial-grade alcohol in that facility as well. So by the end of this year, our run rate in terms of industrial ethanol production would have increased by over 50%.\n In addition, the quality of the ethanol that we produce is very, very high. I mean you've probably read many stories about hand sanitizers in whereby the quality of the alcohol within the hand sanitizers is poor. And frankly, a lot of them have been pulled out of the market. The customers are looking for a high-quality industrial alcohol. And that's what ADM is able to deliver. That's the reason why we've expanded capacity in order to meet the demands of these customers. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. \nKenneth Zaslow: As you see the oil seed markets developing, is there any thoughts that there may be some additional capacity being built anywhere that would be alarming? Or any thought that you would think that would come about? And what are your plans? Is it more of a debottlenecking procedures? Or would you think that there would be some thought that you might find some capacity expansion opportunities? \nJuan Luciano: Yes, Ken. At this point in time, again, it's a very positive environment from a margin and demand perspective. So I think that we're all looking through readiness and everything, how to expand capacity with as little capital as possible, of course, to debottleneck every facility. We are very prudent in thinking about new staff that cannot be integrated. I think we're very proud of the integration of our facilities that help a lot the integration with grain, the integration with refineries.\n So at this point in time, going to the earlier part of your question, we don't see any major announcement that worries us. I think that in reality, the industry needs some of that extra capacity that we heard about it. And I think that we continue to have our plan. As I said, we put together our 5-year plan from '19 to '24. That includes some expansions to maintain our position there. But this is a very disciplined market in which we follow demand and we follow what our customers and the final consumers are doing. So we are looking at that, and we have flexibility.\n I don't think this is an industry that goes like other industries that maybe build a lot of capacity, and then it takes many years for them to build, to grow into that capacity. This is an industry that tend to grow in manageable chunks. And I think that we've been a player into that, and we know how to do it. So I don't worry that much about that, not at this point in time, Ken. \nKenneth Zaslow: I know the question was asked, but I'm going to ask you a little differently because not that I didn't like the answer, I'm just trying to figure out a little bit more quantification. How can you frame the opportunity that's associated with renewable diesel to your margin structure or to your earnings potential? How incremental is this? Is this a noticeable difference? Is this a -- hey, it's kind of like a cherry on an ice cream Sunday? Or is it kind of the ice cream? How do you think about it? \nJuan Luciano: So I think -- listen, I think the numbers if -- let's say that even if you take 70% of the announced capacity happened to be through, it's a significant number. It's not -- so we're going to be a player there. Of course, we're going to be a player in -- for a while there. We have very good facilities in biodiesel that are integrated with our refineries, with our crushing plants. So in that sense, they are more secure than others in the fight for soybean oil, if you will.\n But I think as we said it -- as I said it at the onset, I think that we need to see how this develop because this is the fight for decarbonization of the economy, if you will. And there are many things coming into play for the long-term perspective, whether it's electric vehicles and other solutions. Remember, we were not discussing renewable green diesel a year ago. And there may be another solution coming back, another thing coming back later. So I think that we are all being prudent, not because we see any long-term bad, but also because we realize there are many people and many technologies looking at how to decarbonize the economy and transportation and all that.\n So I think it's a positive. I think we're going to participate in that. I think that if everything that is announced or, as I said, 70% comes, I think it's going to be significant and meaningful. But I think at least for the next few years down the road, this is going to bring tightness to the oil market, which is going to increase associate margins, and we have seen that happening and will increase -- and will keep crush margins robust as they are today.\n So -- but reading much further than that, forecasting in this energy area is prone to mislead people because technology is coming very rapidly into the area. And technology tends to have this breakthrough impact, if you will, as renewable green diesel is having it right now, but we need to see the duration of all that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. \nSteven Haynes: This is actually Steve Haynes on for Vincent. The operating environment clearly firmed up nicely for you guys. I wanted to just come back to kind of some of the self-help things you have going on. And if you got kind of $500 million to $600 million of controllable benefit this year, do you have any kind of target as we look into 2021, so what a like-for-like number could look like? \nJuan Luciano: Yes. I would say we probably will provide more granularity on -- we are going through our own planning season. So we're going to provide more granularity at the Q4 call on 2021 targets. But I think that if you've been following us, you see that there is a certain cadence to what we bring to the table. And these programs are not a one-off, when we are engaging things like readiness, which is a key component of that or harvesting or improve. We're working on our portfolio. Hopefully, we're going to have less improved going forward and more harvesting.\n But -- so the mix of that is going to change somehow. Some things don't repeat themselves. For example, thankfully, like the storms that we have in 2019 didn't reproduce in the same damage in 2020. So some of those things may come up and down. But there are some solid trends. You can see in readiness, those programs are very robust. So we're going to build the algorithm on the things that we can control. And we're probably going to come again with more granularity in the next earnings call.\n But as I said, I think you -- I think investors have gotten used to our cadence on that. And we tend to have a very robust portfolio of things that we can control. And so it's not going to be a shocking array of possibilities. You're going to see possibilities around harvesting, around some improvements and around readiness. And the numbers may fluctuate here and there, but that's the gist of it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. \nAdam Samuelson: So maybe the first question is just coming back to the balance sheet and capital deployment. And Ray, I think you were -- we have the Wilmar proceeds. You did the kind of debt, kind of optimization actions or -- last quarter. Can you help us think about kind of the -- your very heavy moving into that commentary on balance sheet optionality. Can you talk about kind of what you think the dry powder is from an M&A perspective right now and how that pipeline would look? And what we should be thinking about if there's any immaterial M&A that would kind of just help us frame kind of how -- what -- how big are we thinking about? \nRay Young: Yes. Just to again remind people, when we did the Wilmar equity block transaction, secondary offering, we were creating effectively balance sheet flexibility by improving the capital base of our company. So it was not a liquidity move. We had ample liquidity. It's basically helping to further deleverage the balance sheet. And so -- I mean, as we indicated, our intent -- after funding the Neovia acquisition earlier this year, our intent was to basically get our balance sheet back into the low 2s, when you think about metrics, get down to the low 2s by the end of the year. And so these actions are designed to help us get to the low 2s. And I feel good that with the actions that we've done, we're going to get there towards the low 2s.\n And so that creates balance sheet flexibility on our part. And as we indicated, that gives us the flexibility to pursue bolt-on acquisitions. And as you know, Vince always has a list of opportunities that he's looking at. And our responsibility is to make sure that we have the balance sheet in order to kind of support it when these opportunities materialize. And then also share repurchases, I mean, to the extent that the equity markets make a correction in the future, due to whatever reasons, macroeconomic issues. And we have the balance sheet also to pursue opportunistic share repurchases when we think that there is a significant value gap relative to our intrinsic value.\n So we're doing this. We've done that. We pursued some debt repurchases as well, debt tenders. And just to remind you, earlier this year, we issued some long bonds when the credit markets were extremely volatile. I mean, at that juncture, we did not know what was going to happen in the short-term credit markets. We didn't know how the central banks were going to behave. Well, what's turned out is that central banks have come in to support the markets. And so with the balance sheet that we had, the liquidity position that we had, we decided to opportunistically go on tender bonds and actually execute some that make-whole on some of the bonds outstanding. And so we actually -- we purchased about $1.2 billion worth of debt in the quarter with positive NPV transactions. And so with the credit profile that we have, our debt cost that we had, this was a tremendous transaction from an NPV perspective, delivering good value for our shareholders here, right?\n So I think we've got the balance sheet into the shape that we would like. We got $10 billion in liquidity. So we can weather any type of additional global slowdown that maybe a second wave of COVID-19 could bring to this company. We have no issues in terms of being able to weather any of the risks associated with the second wave and the impacts there. And we have the dry powder right now for Vince to go pursue the bolt-ons that we've talked about in the past. \nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Tom Simonitsch with JPMorgan. \nThomas Simonitsch: So maybe one last question on the $1 billion nutrition operating profit, and apologies if I missed this, but what range of revenues do you need to meet that target? And in the near term, when do you expect the top line in nutrition to return to growth? \nVincent Macciocchi: Thanks, Tom. Well, the top line in nutrition is growing. When you look across the broader nutrition business on a year-to-date basis, where we've grown at approximately 6% FX adjusted. So we have a very aggressive growth plan from a revenue perspective. And obviously, there are some puts and takes. There's been some headwinds related to COVID affecting some of our sectors as well as some FX issues. But at the same token, we've realized significant revenue growth in certain areas of our portfolio. When you look at the Flavors business, primarily in North America and Asia Pacific, we look at our Specialty Ingredients business, primarily in North America, South America, in the growth of plant-based meat alternatives. We look in Health & Wellness. Obviously, very important growth across that space, really in terms of the bioactives, our specialty oils, our fiber portfolio. So with our fixation on customers, we're growing top line revenues. It's one of the key tenets of our organic growth opportunities in our plan. And then look at animal nutrition. So obviously, there's some things that have affected aquaculture and some other FX things there related to the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. But at the same token on a year-to-date basis, we're up 7.5% FX adjusted. So we do have a very aggressive plan to drive the revenue. We're focused on revenue.\n I mentioned pipeline earlier. That's a key barometer to how we measure our opportunity for future success and to drive revenue growth. So it's a heavy emphasis. And obviously, at the same time, while we're growing revenue and we're growing our businesses across the portfolio, if you look at our margin performance, it's increased as well. So we're focused on price, we're focused on profitability, and we're focusing on margining up all of our businesses across the portfolio. \nThomas Simonitsch: And do you have a revenue level in mind getting to that $1 billion operating profit? \nVincent Macciocchi: Yes. I think there's a couple of things. I mean when I spoke at the outset, when you talk about growth in the overall market of 5% to 7% per year, we certainly need to be in that range or outpacing that range. And obviously, we continue to marry with our operating profit performance. As Juan outlined, we're approximately -- to continue on our current trajectory, 15% per year gets us to that within the time horizon of this plan. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Victoria de la Huerga for closing remarks. \nVictoria Huerga: Thank you for joining us today. Slide 14 notes upcoming investor events in which we will be participating. As always, please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions.\n Have a good day, and thanks for your time and interest in ADM. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. On behalf of ADM, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Victoria. Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.89, up from $0.77 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted segment operating profit was $849 million, up 11% year-over-year, and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 8.3%.\n Our strategic initiatives have continued to enable our teams around the world to demonstrate their expertise and skills. And I'm proud of how our colleagues are supporting customers and driving strong results. The team has done a great job handling the daily and sometimes hourly challenges that have come our way in 2020. That resiliency allows us to deliver outstanding results today while we simultaneously continue our strategic work to make our company better and advance our growth and transformation.\n Let me share with you some of our accomplishments. In our optimize pillar, our Ag Services and Oilseeds team continued its work to enhance returns, delivering another $100 million in invested capital reductions in the third quarter. Since 2017, Ag Services and Oilseeds has improved its capital position by exiting from no longer strategic assets, including 71 grain origination locations, 6 oilseed facilities, 14 Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts locations and 7 ocean-going vessels.\n We've also seen first-hand how our improvement initiatives have helped drive business continuity. In addition to the pandemic, in recent months, we've seen multiple hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf under the rage of storm that swept across the Midwest. Despite those events, thanks to our teams and our operational excellence, we have continued to serve our customers and fulfill our purpose without significant interruption.\n In our drive pillar, we are continuing to accelerate our 1ADM business transformation, expanding the deployment of our procurement, contract labor and sales and marketing modules, which are helping us drive efficiencies and growth and will provide us with a trove of data to support enhanced analytics and decision-making.\n Our Decatur corn complex ongoing strong performance from grind to gluten and germ meal to workplace safety continues to demonstrate the benefits of our centralized operations organization. Our supply chain center of excellence is delivering as well. Using our enhanced processes and tools as well as integrated planning between commercial, supply chain and operations, we've recently piloted changes at the nutrition facility that are on track to unlock a 20-plus percent increase in production capacity at that location and have already resulted in enhancements in customer service without additional capital spending. We'll be rolling these kinds of improvements out to other locations.\n In our expand pillar, we are continuing to harvest our investments. For example, year-to-date, our Algar Agro acquisition has tripled its year-over-year operating profit. In a very short time, Algar has grown to be an important component of the South American business. We've successfully expanded production of high-quality USP grade alcohol in Peoria and Clinton to meet high demand for hand sanitizer. We announced the construction of a new state-of-the-art production facility in Spain that will dramatically expand our ability to meet growing demand for probiotics and other consumer products to support health and wellness.\n We also signed a long-term agreement with Japanese startup Spiber Inc. This project taps into our innovative spirit and capabilities creating value from across our supply chain from the corn we buy to the dextrose we make, to the science and manufacturing technology we have invested in. And it meets a critical need in the marketplace for both consumer and industrial products that come from sustainable sources.\n Our transformation and growth and our confidence in the future will not be possible without readiness. By the end of the third quarter, our team identified and executed on readiness initiatives that unlocked almost $1.2 billion in run rate benefits. And now I'm pleased to announce that we are on track to achieve $1.3 billion by the end of the year.\n Readiness encompasses and supports our entire company. It drives the strategic imperatives that help us fulfill our purpose, such as sustainability. We are advancing our sustainability efforts on many fronts, such as our Strive 35 goals to improve our performance on greenhouse gases, energy, water and waste.\n Readiness creates growth enablers. For example, we're continuing to elevate our commercial excellence with innovative tools like our consumer insight programs and virtual customer technologies. And of course, readiness is one of the key elements powering the growth algorithm we laid out at the beginning of the year. Because of its success, along with tremendous progress in our harvest and improved initiatives, we now expect to meet or exceed the high end of our $500 million to $600 million goal for targeted improvement in 2020.\n So before I turn to Ray, I'd like to say that it's our pleasure to welcome Vince today on this call. In 2014, we started a new journey with the acquisition of WILD Flavors and the launch of a full-service nutrition business, offering customers a broad array of products and services. I could not be more proud of the growth we have seen since then.\n Nutrition has delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year OP growth. Revenue is up 5.7% on a currency-adjusted basis for the first 9 months of the year. And in the years since we acquired WILD, we are nearly tripled OP in the flavors business. As we've been getting more and more questions about that business and its growth potential, we decided that it was the perfect time to update and explain the business further.\n But before we get to Vince though, I'll turn it over to Ray to take us through our business performance. Ray? Thank you, Vince. And congratulations to you and the entire ADM team for another outstanding quarter.\n Slide 13, please. Across the enterprise, we are continuing to advance our work to enrich the quality of life and meet key needs for consumers around the globe. At the time of heightened concerns around food security, ADM's vast global value chain is helping ensure that countries and families can continue to put nutritious, delicious foods on the table. As consumers focus more and more on proactive approaches to health, we're expanding the frontier in groundbreaking functional ingredients and supplements for people with conditions like migraine and atopic dermatitis, and we're paving the way to a new world of precision nutrition personalized for every individual. And as sustainability becomes a key driver of consumer decisions and business success, we're playing a leading role in the transition to a low-carbon economy for our industry.\n We are committed to our purpose, and our team is continuing to deliver for our customers, our shareholders and all could depend on us. And that is why we are confident in a strong finish to 2020 and a positive momentum continuing through 2021.\n With that, Amy, please open the line for questions. Yes, Eric, thank you. I think -- listen, I think I'm very proud, first of all, of course, of the way the team has been executed. And I think we have a track record of consistent execution on that so that -- from that perspective. Second, I think the important thing to reflect upon is that we have built the business over these few years, aligned to secular trends on food security, on health and wellness and on sustainability. And we see those trends being with us for the duration that I can see going forward.\n So when we look at our planning horizon, we feel very good about that, about achieving our 10% ROIC, and we're achieving our goals in earnings and reduction on invested capital. When we look at the -- even the issues that we're seeing today with the pandemic, the pandemic has basically increased or emphasized some of the trends that we have been already developing over time with the consumers. And you see governments more concerned about food security now and the ability to keep supplying food for the world. And I think that we are a key element in that. And our footprint and our ability to connect the areas of surplus with areas of deficit in the world is valued and is recognized and I think that, that will continue going forward.\n I think that everything that we're doing in terms of positioning our portfolio for healthier trends. We see the reaction on that. We see the reaction in plant-based proteins. We see the reaction in probiotics, but we see the reaction also on the snacking in functional foods. And all that is very strong in the ADM portfolio. And we continue to see the pool from biomaterials, from materials based on plant that actually replaces other fossil fuel type of build materials that have more push. So we see it in the scale and the reach that we have for food security. We see it in the specialization that we see in nutrition, and we see it in the demand for sustainability.\n So as far as we can tell, again, we are finishing the year very strong with the Q4 that we are very excited about, and we are entering Q1 with a strong momentum. So we certainly see 2021 with a lot of optimism. I think conditions are there for us to have good times, and we don't see at this point in time what is the thing that will change that. Demand is strong. I think if anything, China has come rolling back from the pandemic. Their recovery has surprised everybody. At the same time that the economy recovers, they are recovering from ASF, which they are rebuilding their herds. At the time when, candidly, Brazil has sold -- because we were part of that, has sold all the pipeline of beans in which Argentina doesn't have an incentive to sell. And for the very first time in a long time, the world needs the U.S. supply for both soybeans and corn.\n So we are looking at it from several angles, to be honest, and we see it fine. We see also, even in the crush margins that is a crush supported by both legs now. Traditionally, it has been more on the mill side, but we have a very big oil story developing around the world and it has all these conditions. Whether it's biodiesel or renewable green diesel or just the recovery of food service, we have been pulling oil demand.\n So again, at this point in time, we see the future with a lot of optimism and a lot of confidence in our team's ability to execute on that. Yes. Thank you, Ben. So the first one, ASF. As we said, I think ASF, we've been following this story for several quarters. And I think that overall, it has developed as we predicted. So initially, with the big gap in protein in China that was supplemented by imports of proteins, and we saw that in the strength of crush margins. Now China has been able to control that. Now China is rebuilding their herd. Remember that herd was -- about half of the herd was decimated. So there is a big effort to rebuild that. As they rebuild the herd, they are going into more professional animal production. That has increased the rations. So -- that has increased soy meal, but that has increased corn. That's why you see so much pull from China from imported corn. At the same time, we have seen the poultry industry coming up in China to supplement a little bit the lack of pork protein that they have in China.\n So we've seen all that. We think that there's still probably a couple of years ahead of us for China to recover the herd plenty. And of course, you heard their statement about trying to go for self-sufficiency. So I think they're going to build that. So we're going to see continued strength in crush margins. And we feel that, that's driving demand.\n Again, as I said before, the professionalization of the animal husbandry has brought more soybean meal and corn into the ration, and we will continue to see better feeding and better nutrition in that sense. So again, nothing surprising maybe to what we expected.\n And remember that in the previous quarter, we talked about our positive view of crush margins over the second half of the year. And that's the way we predicted, that's the way we played, and that's the way it is working out. So -- and China is behind a lot of that.\n Your second question was on Wilmar and our allocation of capital. Listen, Wilmar, we are very proud of the Wilmar ownership and relationship that we have had for many years. It's a very strategic partner for us, which gave us last night, another gift with great results. The team continues to execute. And again, it's a little bit related to what I'm saying. China has come in rolling back from the pandemic and the recovery and Wilmar is a big part of that.\n We made a reallocation of capital decision. Again, we're going to hold to our 20% share there. We are very comfortable and committed to that for the long term. This was just a matter of we wanted to strengthen our balance sheet after the acquisitions, you heard Vince, between WILD Flavors and Neovia. We need to get back to that. I mean we are comfortable into that. And we want to get back to support Vince with the bolt-ons that he needs and some organic investments. We are increasing the capacity as we announced in Biopolis by fivefold, where things are growing there. And I'm sure Vince has a long list of bolt-ons that he wants to execute, another organic growth as we grow geographically some of the successes that we have in North America and Europe.\n So that basically is nothing behind that other than that. And we continue to support R&D. You talked about a lot -- you heard Vince talking a lot about science-based functional products and science-based nutrition. And that's important, and that takes money. So it's money that we gladly invest in that because we are seeing the returns on that. Not everybody has business in their segment that grow 5 consecutive quarters or more than 20% per quarter in terms of operating profit. So we are very proud with that.\n And your third question was about renewable green diesel? Yes. And listen, we participate that as a supplier of feedstock. You see the tightening that this has generated because, of course, there has been stable volumes and very healthy margins of biodiesel that we've been supplying. And also, we've seen the tightness that, that generated as food service has recovered in the oil part of the consumption.\n So I think that we follow that with interest. It's another leg that adds to the strength of crush margins. So in the short term, it's a very positive tailwind. We have to see how that industry evolves. There are many factors in this industry. There are many announcements that they are all positive. That will put some pressure in feedstocks, of course. And we're going to see how that announced, how many states or countries adopt these, how many of these investments are actually come through into real plans and then how many other feedstocks are allowed here to come.\n Today, the environment of feedstock is a little bit of a rarefied environment because we have less of restaurants creating cooked oil and then we have a little bit of less production of -- in the ethanol side. So -- but we have potential to bring canola into these that we are -- it's a good carbon index also.\n So there are a lot of dynamics. But I think short term, we are participating just as a supplier of soybean oil and that we are profiting from that in the crush margins that we are seeing. Yes. Maybe if I start, and I'll let Vince complete that with some more granularity. But when we look at our strategic plan, and we plan in 5-year increments, so the last one we did in 2019, so 2019 to 2024, we see our $1 billion OP that Vince described being achieved in that planning cycle. So let's say, by 2024, if you want to say it that way.\n In order to get there from here, you can see the nutrition approximately needs to grow around 15% per year compounded to get to that number. So that number is excluded any major M&A. That number is in the current strategy, which is organic growth and bolt on. So about the ratio that you're seeing right now going.\n So maybe then I pass it to Vince to provide more granularity on where that growth comes from. And then we're going to keep pushing Vince to get there faster. Yes. Well, so I'm not going to be on record predicting a devaluation in Argentina, Rob, since I would like to go back one day, but let's put it this way. The world is tight today. There is a big demand, as I said, from China. And even if -- let's run your scenario in which Argentina devalue and there is an incentive for the farmer to sell. Then may be only like 5 million tons that they're going to throw into the market. To be honest, the market needs that, and the market will absorb that very quickly and move on.\n So I don't see that as a big source of derailment. I don't know what the source of derailment could be. But I don't worry that much about that. I think, again, the market is tight enough today. Brazil's crop is a couple of weeks late. So there is a La Nin\u0303a effect that we still need to see what's going to do to yields. And although I think that Brazil, we have a big crop, I don't think we're going to have 140 million tons crop given the start and the conditions that there are.\n So I think that at this point in time, I worry more about where the beans and where the mill is going to come from later on than actually if Argentina will flood the market. We don't see that as an opportunity. If you hear -- I mean if you -- unfortunately, I don't have the opportunity to be back in Brazil or Argentina at this stage. But as I talked to Brazil, Brazil is an environment of -- in an environment of food inflation and imports right now, where they're bringing imports from Paraguay, from Uruguay for beans.\n So I think you see the need, and we see it with a customer base that is very uncovered, to be honest. So these are people that are buying hand to mouth for strong demand. And it's our role to supply that and to cover that. But as I said, we worry a little bit more about making sure that the flow from the farmers continue so we have the material to continue to execute and to feed the world. Yes, Ken. At this point in time, again, it's a very positive environment from a margin and demand perspective. So I think that we're all looking through readiness and everything, how to expand capacity with as little capital as possible, of course, to debottleneck every facility. We are very prudent in thinking about new staff that cannot be integrated. I think we're very proud of the integration of our facilities that help a lot the integration with grain, the integration with refineries.\n So at this point in time, going to the earlier part of your question, we don't see any major announcement that worries us. I think that in reality, the industry needs some of that extra capacity that we heard about it. And I think that we continue to have our plan. As I said, we put together our 5-year plan from '19 to '24. That includes some expansions to maintain our position there. But this is a very disciplined market in which we follow demand and we follow what our customers and the final consumers are doing. So we are looking at that, and we have flexibility.\n I don't think this is an industry that goes like other industries that maybe build a lot of capacity, and then it takes many years for them to build, to grow into that capacity. This is an industry that tend to grow in manageable chunks. And I think that we've been a player into that, and we know how to do it. So I don't worry that much about that, not at this point in time, Ken. So I think -- listen, I think the numbers if -- let's say that even if you take 70% of the announced capacity happened to be through, it's a significant number. It's not -- so we're going to be a player there. Of course, we're going to be a player in -- for a while there. We have very good facilities in biodiesel that are integrated with our refineries, with our crushing plants. So in that sense, they are more secure than others in the fight for soybean oil, if you will.\n But I think as we said it -- as I said it at the onset, I think that we need to see how this develop because this is the fight for decarbonization of the economy, if you will. And there are many things coming into play for the long-term perspective, whether it's electric vehicles and other solutions. Remember, we were not discussing renewable green diesel a year ago. And there may be another solution coming back, another thing coming back later. So I think that we are all being prudent, not because we see any long-term bad, but also because we realize there are many people and many technologies looking at how to decarbonize the economy and transportation and all that.\n So I think it's a positive. I think we're going to participate in that. I think that if everything that is announced or, as I said, 70% comes, I think it's going to be significant and meaningful. But I think at least for the next few years down the road, this is going to bring tightness to the oil market, which is going to increase associate margins, and we have seen that happening and will increase -- and will keep crush margins robust as they are today.\n So -- but reading much further than that, forecasting in this energy area is prone to mislead people because technology is coming very rapidly into the area. And technology tends to have this breakthrough impact, if you will, as renewable green diesel is having it right now, but we need to see the duration of all that. Yes. I would say we probably will provide more granularity on -- we are going through our own planning season. So we're going to provide more granularity at the Q4 call on 2021 targets. But I think that if you've been following us, you see that there is a certain cadence to what we bring to the table. And these programs are not a one-off, when we are engaging things like readiness, which is a key component of that or harvesting or improve. We're working on our portfolio. Hopefully, we're going to have less improved going forward and more harvesting.\n But -- so the mix of that is going to change somehow. Some things don't repeat themselves. For example, thankfully, like the storms that we have in 2019 didn't reproduce in the same damage in 2020. So some of those things may come up and down. But there are some solid trends. You can see in readiness, those programs are very robust. So we're going to build the algorithm on the things that we can control. And we're probably going to come again with more granularity in the next earnings call.\n But as I said, I think you -- I think investors have gotten used to our cadence on that. And we tend to have a very robust portfolio of things that we can control. And so it's not going to be a shocking array of possibilities. You're going to see possibilities around harvesting, around some improvements and around readiness. And the numbers may fluctuate here and there, but that's the gist of it."

            "content": "Thank you, Ray. Slide 9, please. I'm proud of the team who have delivered in so many ways. When I reflect upon the growth we've made and the journey we are still taking, I keep coming back to our purpose, to unlock the power of nature, to enrich the quality of life. I think it's remarkable how these few words sum up not just what we do but why our work is so important.\n The global population is growing, and consumer behavior is shifting in ways we couldn't have predicted only 10 or 15 years ago. The scale of the change and the opportunity for ADM is enormous. Global sales of specialty ingredients across both human and animal nutrition are as much as $85 billion and growing at a rate of 5% to 7% per year. These specialty ingredients, which represent the majority of the nutrition portfolio aside from fee, go into the full array of consumer nutrition products for humans and animals, many of which are projected to grow significantly in the coming years.\n For example, the global market for functional beverages could be as large as $190 billion in 2024. The global dietary supplement market could be worth more than $77 billion in that same time frame. Global retail sales of alternative proteins are already a $25 billion market today, with a projected growth rate of 14% per year. Global retail sales of pet food are projected to grow at 4% per year, reaching $120 billion by 2024.\n These aren't just numbers. They're indicators of significant long-term trends in how people choose food, drink and other products, driven by a global population that cares deeply about health and sustainability. And based upon the portfolio, footprint, capabilities and talent we've built, no other company is positioned to meet these needs and lead in these industries like ADM.\n Please turn to Slide 10. It's been 6 years since we started on this journey. In that time, we built or expanded more than 16 facilities, from our pea protein complex in the U.S. through our network of premix plants in China. We've enhanced our science and technology capabilities, invested in market research and consumer insights and built new interactive ways to engage with customers from our more than 50 global customer innovation centers to daily virtual innovation and tasting sessions. We've made platform acquisitions, and we've added bolt-ons. All in all, we have invested just over $6 billion to build our global leadership position in nutrition.\n These investments are delivering results. Since 2014, we've increased our annual revenue by $3 billion. And by the end of this year, we'll have grown operating profits by more than $300 million over those 6 years, more than double.\n Slide 11, please. Our Human Nutrition business can offer customers ingredients, flavor systems or turnkey product development solutions, supporting them every step of the way to take their ideas from concept to prototype to market in record time. In Animal Nutrition, only 1.5 years after we completed our Neovia acquisition, we can look back on a successful integration in which we exceeded our synergy goals and built a global business that offers a full portfolio of on-trend items, from pet treats to enzymes to ingredients for aquaculture to meet evolving customer needs.\n In our Health and Wellness business, which is part of our Human Nutrition subsegment, our scientists are expanding the universe of pro-, pre- and postbiotics and other functional products to meet growing demand, from stand-alone supplements to ingredients that help enhance our array of human and animal solutions.\n Taken together, our extremely broad portfolio of ingredients and solutions can add value for customers across both human and animal nutrition. For instance, taste and color are just as important for animal nutrition customers today, as they are for food and beverage customers. Functional ingredients matter in both human and animal nutrition and so on across our entire pantry.\n Then we add the rest of ADM's capabilities. In plant-based protein, for example, we have the unique advantage of ADM's broad and integrated value chain, from sourcing and transporting the soybeans and peas to transforming them into high-protein ingredients at our own facilities, to adding the colors, flavors, oils and other key elements to create just the right taste, appearance, juiciness and sizzle for delicious finished plant-based products.\n Please turn to Slide 12. We're proud to have come this far in 6 short years, but our eye is on the future. We are confident in continuing our growth story. It starts with the global category trends I outlined earlier. It continues with our extensive and ongoing research into consumer behavior and needs.\n Earlier this week, we released our latest view of the top consumer trends of 2021 based upon research that includes our proprietary outside voice consumer insights program. Our findings show that the events of the past year are accelerating and deepening fundamental market shifts, including consumers taking a more proactive approach to nourishing body and mind, the microbiome as the gateway to wellness, continued growing demand for plant-based foods, sustainability as a key driver of purchasing decisions and transparency as a building block of consumer trust.\n The last piece of the equation is how our team brings it all together for our customers, combining unmatched customer support and service with our vast value chain to deliver ingredients, systems and solution that align perfectly with market trends and needs. These are the reasons we expect to continue to lead the industry outpacing the market and operating profit growth, and we remain confident in reaching $1 billion in OP in the medium-term future.\n With that, I'll turn it back to Juan. Thank you, Eric. I think if you think about our business -- and maybe I'll start kind of where you finished in terms of some of our greatest strengths. I think our greater strengths are obviously the breadth and depth of the pantry coupled with our technical capabilities and providing solutions backed by science. I think you also marry that with the global consumer trends when you think about the focus on the microbiome, focus on plant-based foods, sustainability and good for you, and you think about clean label moving to clear label.\n Our portfolio is really well positioned when you think about our flavors business and the focus on natural and our continued growth in the mature market and as we expand our footprint into the emerging markets.\n Specialty ingredients, obviously, we have a dominant share as a key protein -- plant-based protein provider. And we're providing soy, pea and wheat from a plant-based protein perspective and really capitalizing on that global consumer trend.\n If you look at our Health and Wellness business, we have a fantastic portfolio, really focused on probiotics and postbiotics as well as fiber as well as vitamins as well as specialty oil, so a really complete portfolio across Health and Wellness.\n And then obviously in Animal Nutrition, we completed the acquisition of Neovia in 2019. Obviously, we've over-delivered against the synergy targets, but it's a global, robust business. It's really focused on, obviously, complete feed additives and ingredients, aquaculture, pet. So really moving that portfolio to realize synergies, grow organically and capitalize on our global footprint.\n So where is our opportunity? There's certainly opportunity to further expand in the flavors business into emerging markets. We're always looking at technology in our portfolio and geography, in the plant-based business and specialty ingredients. It's really making sure we're providing outside of the Americas and looking to enhance our footprint there.\n In Health and Wellness, it's really capitalizing on the microbiome and expanding our capability. Juan mentioned in his remarks that we're expanding our facility in Valencia, Spain. That will give us significant capacity increase to capitalize on our growing demand.\n And then on animal, I think our story is really one where we finish the integration, we grow organically, we margin up that portfolio, and we continue to combine all pieces of our portfolio and provide solutions backed by science. Thank you, Juan, and thank you, Ben. I think it's important if you just take a pause and see where we're at. If you look on a year-to-date basis through 3 quarters, we're at $448 million, whereas we did $419 million all of last year. So to Juan's point, it's a good growth story and a good growth trajectory from an organic basis. And what we've done is we've really taken the approach of let's grow organically. Let's expand our customer base. We've made significant investments in our key account management program and our approach to the customers and really expanding that base on a worldwide basis.\n As I mentioned in my remarks that we've invested over $6 billion in this business. So yes, we've done platform deals that we've integrated and then grown organically, and we've done a series of bolt-ons. But additionally, we've invested in our own facilities. We built a greenfield pea production facility in Enderlin. We built a soy protein complex in Campo Grande in Brazil. We've done acquisitions in the citrus space, the vanilla space, the food-based space, the bioactive space. And so obviously, we're harvesting those investments right now and continuing to take those businesses and grow those businesses and add them to our portfolio of capabilities. So I think that's what gives us some optimism. And we look at our win rate in the marketplace as well. And we look at our pipeline of opportunities.\n Again, when you take these capabilities and the size of the pantry which we depicted earlier, and you marry those with the technical capabilities we have on a worldwide basis from a science and technology perspective and a creation, design and development perspective, that translates to a very high win rate against customer opportunities that actually launched in the marketplace.\n Therefore, we have an organic growth road map as Juan identified within the time horizon of the strategic plan that will get us to that $1 billion aspiration. And again, we'll continue to search, as Juan indicated earlier, for smart bolt-ons and perhaps platform deals if and when they make sense. Thanks, Tom. Well, the top line in nutrition is growing. When you look across the broader nutrition business on a year-to-date basis, where we've grown at approximately 6% FX adjusted. So we have a very aggressive growth plan from a revenue perspective. And obviously, there are some puts and takes. There's been some headwinds related to COVID affecting some of our sectors as well as some FX issues. But at the same token, we've realized significant revenue growth in certain areas of our portfolio. When you look at the Flavors business, primarily in North America and Asia Pacific, we look at our Specialty Ingredients business, primarily in North America, South America, in the growth of plant-based meat alternatives. We look in Health & Wellness. Obviously, very important growth across that space, really in terms of the bioactives, our specialty oils, our fiber portfolio. So with our fixation on customers, we're growing top line revenues. It's one of the key tenets of our organic growth opportunities in our plan. And then look at animal nutrition. So obviously, there's some things that have affected aquaculture and some other FX things there related to the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. But at the same token on a year-to-date basis, we're up 7.5% FX adjusted. So we do have a very aggressive plan to drive the revenue. We're focused on revenue.\n I mentioned pipeline earlier. That's a key barometer to how we measure our opportunity for future success and to drive revenue growth. So it's a heavy emphasis. And obviously, at the same time, while we're growing revenue and we're growing our businesses across the portfolio, if you look at our margin performance, it's increased as well. So we're focused on price, we're focused on profitability, and we're focusing on margining up all of our businesses across the portfolio. Yes. I think there's a couple of things. I mean when I spoke at the outset, when you talk about growth in the overall market of 5% to 7% per year, we certainly need to be in that range or outpacing that range. And obviously, we continue to marry with our operating profit performance. As Juan outlined, we're approximately -- to continue on our current trajectory, 15% per year gets us to that within the time horizon of this plan."

Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $849 million, up 11%. And our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 8.3%, 255 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC. Our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.7 billion.\n Our cash flows are strong as we generate about $2.3 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the first 9 months of the year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was a benefit of approximately 13% compared to an expense of 19% in the prior year. Our Q3 tax rate was impacted by our debt retirement actions as well as the sale of our Wilmar shares and higher year-over-year Wilmar earnings and U.S. tax credits. Absent the effect of EPS adjusting items, our effective tax rate was approximately 11%. We expect our adjusted tax rate for Q4 to be similar to this adjusted Q3 effective tax rate.\n As we announced at various points during Q3, we've taken several actions over the last few months to both utilize and enhance our strong balance sheet. These actions were not about cash flow or liquidity as we had cash and available credit capacity at the end of the quarter of almost $10 billion. They were about creating balance sheet optionality for future transactions while maintaining a strong credit rating profile.\n We monetized a portion of our Wilmar investment through a block sale of Wilmar stock and issuance of bonds exchangeable for Wilmar shares at a future date. As we have indicated, we view our significant remaining Wilmar stake as strategic, and we do not have any intentions to sell additional shares.\n Leveraging our strong cash position, we also rebalanced our mix between long and short-term debt, economically retiring higher coupon debt through positive NPV transactions and reducing interest payments in the future.\n Combined, these actions allow us the flexibility to make strategic investments, further bolt-on acquisitions or buy back shares when it makes sense to do so, all while continuing to make progress in deleveraging our balance sheet and maintaining our single A credit ratings. These actions were also a significant driver of our tax rate.\n Return of capital for the first 9 months was $724 million, including around $115 million in opportunistic share repurchases, the vast majority of which were executed earlier this year. We finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 27%, down from the 30% a year ago.\n Capital spending for the first 9 months was about $560 million. We expect capital spending for the year to be around $800 million that we previously indicated and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion.\n Slide 5, please. Other business results were lower than the prior year quarter, driven by lower ADM investor services earnings and captive insurance underwriting losses, including a $17 million settlement impact for the high water claim with Ag Services and Oilseeds.\n In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $196 million were higher year-over-year, due primarily to variable performance-related incentive compensation accruals, which were low in the prior year. Corporate results this quarter also included $396 million related to the early debt retirement charges that I referred to earlier, which is an EPS adjustment item. Net interest expense for the quarter was similar to the prior year period.\n Looking forward, we expect unallocated corporate expenses to be in line with our initial $800 million guidance for calendar year and Q4 net interest expense to be slightly lower than Q3. We also expect a loss of about $50 million in other business in Q4 due to anticipated intercompany insurance claim settlements.\n Please turn to Slide 6. Ag Services and Oilseeds results were higher than the third quarter of 2019. In Ag Services, we saw extremely good execution around the globe. The North American team did well to capitalize on strong industry export margins and volumes, and the global trade team had another strong quarter as they continued their focus on serving customers. Ag Services also benefit from a $54 million settlement related to the 2019 U.S. high water insurance claims, which is partially offset by an expense in captive insurance.\n The crushing team also did a great job executing in a solid demand environment. Both Ag Services and Crushing saw expanding margins during the quarter resulting in around $155 million in total negative timing effects, which led to lower results. Those timing impacts are expected to reverse in the coming quarters. Refined Products and Other was significantly higher year-over-year, driven by improved biodiesel margins around the globe. Equity earnings from Wilmar were substantially higher versus the prior year period.\n Looking ahead, we expect to see strong North American exports in global crush margins in the fourth quarter, combined to contribute to a very strong Ag Services and Oilseeds performance, with results significantly higher than the third quarter of this year, though lower than Q4 of 2019, which included a $270 million benefit for 2 years of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit.\n Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were significantly higher year-over-year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment was substantially higher driven by strong risk management and improved net corn costs as well as a balanced ethanol industry supply and demand environment. Reduced food service demand affected sweetener and flower volumes but we're seeing good demand recovery for starches in North America. The Vantage corn processors team did a good job executing on the wet mill fuel ethanol distribution and capitalizing on higher year-over-year industry margins while managing the fixed costs from the 2 temporarily idle dry mills. Increased volumes and margins on USP grade industrial alcohol to support the hand sanitizer market also contributed to higher year-over-year profits.\n Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions to be close to Q3 of this year and substantially higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by improved year-over-year fuel ethanol margins and higher industrial-grade sales. While Sweetener and Flower volumes will still be impacted by weaker food service demand, we expect the year-over-year percentage decline to be smaller than it was in Q3.\n On Slide 8, Nutrition delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year profit growth. Human nutrition results were substantially higher versus the prior year quarter, with strength across the entire pantry, including flavors, plant-based proteins and probiotics. Animal Nutrition was also higher year-over-year, driven by continued delivery of Neovia synergies, strengthened livestock and year-over-year improvement in amino acids, partially offset by softer aquaculture feed demand as well as negative foreign currency impacts. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect nutrition to deliver another quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year OP growth with a typically seasonally weaker Q4 in Human Nutrition, offset by seasonally stronger Animal Nutrition.\n I'd now like to transition to Vince Macciocchi, President of our Nutrition business, for an update and overview of the business. Vince, congratulations to you and your team for not just a great quarter but for consistent delivery of strong growth. Yes, it's Ray here. Well, first of all, we've done a very good job managing the stranded costs of our 2 temporarily idle dry mills. And I think also with some additional idlings that have occurred in the industry. I think the industry has done a very good job in terms of balancing supply and demand in the ethanol industry. And that's part of the reason why when you look at inventories right now, EIA count on stocks are below 20 million barrels. And that's contributed towards, frankly, a reasonable ethanol margin environment that we've seen. And that's contributed, frankly speaking towards good results that we've seen both in our Starches and Sweeteners segment, which has the wet mills, and then also for VCP, which has the industrial-grade alcohol of our Peoria facility.\n So we believe that as we kind of enter the winter season, which you know seasonally driving miles come down during the winter, and so therefore, from an ADM perspective, we believe we're probably going to keep these dry mills temporarily idled as we go through the low season of gasoline demand and hence ethanol demand. That's the responsible thing to do.\n Then -- but when we look forward into the new year, as I indicated in the last call, we're going to look at the data, right? And so we're going to look at the data with respect to how the U.S. economy is recovering. We're going to look at the data in terms of how driving miles are going to seasonally recover as well. We're going to look at the data in terms of the industry utilization rates for ethanol because some of these ethanol mills that we've seen idled, they're going to be permanently idled. Some of them -- a lot of them have indicated that they're going to remain permanently idled as opposed to temporarily idled. And then importantly, we're going to be looking on very -- the Tenth Circuit Court ruling on special refinery exemptions and whether the Supreme Court is going to hear the case or not.\n So there's a lot of variables that you're going to be looking at. In addition, you may have heard that China is also starting to look at potential imports of ethanol from United States into the country. I think there's been 1 boat that has gone to China. But they are making a lot of inquiries about U.S. ethanol. And so all of these variables are going to be very important factors in terms of our assessment in terms of when we actually restart these dry mills. Based upon any or all these variables becoming favorable, we could see that with the -- let's say, the spring season when normally the industry starts building up inventories of ethanol for the summer driving season, we could see that as we get into spring, that we may restart the dry mills again.\n But again, this will be a data-driven decision. We recognize the importance that we play in order to make sure we have good supply/demand balances in our industry. But again, looking at the variables, as we see it right now, we could -- we clearly see the path towards some sort of restart in the first half of next year. It's been a good news story, right? I mean we started the year with 1 plant, our Peoria plant, 85 million gallons a year. Demand shot through the roof for industrial-grade alcohol. And so we actually combination ran the plant hard plus we've expanded the capacity of that plant. So we'll be up to 100 million gallons very shortly. And then secondly, we also made some investments into another facility, Clinton, and we're going to actually expand production of industrial-grade alcohol in that facility as well. So by the end of this year, our run rate in terms of industrial ethanol production would have increased by over 50%.\n In addition, the quality of the ethanol that we produce is very, very high. I mean you've probably read many stories about hand sanitizers in whereby the quality of the alcohol within the hand sanitizers is poor. And frankly, a lot of them have been pulled out of the market. The customers are looking for a high-quality industrial alcohol. And that's what ADM is able to deliver. That's the reason why we've expanded capacity in order to meet the demands of these customers. Yes. Just to again remind people, when we did the Wilmar equity block transaction, secondary offering, we were creating effectively balance sheet flexibility by improving the capital base of our company. So it was not a liquidity move. We had ample liquidity. It's basically helping to further deleverage the balance sheet. And so -- I mean, as we indicated, our intent -- after funding the Neovia acquisition earlier this year, our intent was to basically get our balance sheet back into the low 2s, when you think about metrics, get down to the low 2s by the end of the year. And so these actions are designed to help us get to the low 2s. And I feel good that with the actions that we've done, we're going to get there towards the low 2s.\n And so that creates balance sheet flexibility on our part. And as we indicated, that gives us the flexibility to pursue bolt-on acquisitions. And as you know, Vince always has a list of opportunities that he's looking at. And our responsibility is to make sure that we have the balance sheet in order to kind of support it when these opportunities materialize. And then also share repurchases, I mean, to the extent that the equity markets make a correction in the future, due to whatever reasons, macroeconomic issues. And we have the balance sheet also to pursue opportunistic share repurchases when we think that there is a significant value gap relative to our intrinsic value.\n So we're doing this. We've done that. We pursued some debt repurchases as well, debt tenders. And just to remind you, earlier this year, we issued some long bonds when the credit markets were extremely volatile. I mean, at that juncture, we did not know what was going to happen in the short-term credit markets. We didn't know how the central banks were going to behave. Well, what's turned out is that central banks have come in to support the markets. And so with the balance sheet that we had, the liquidity position that we had, we decided to opportunistically go on tender bonds and actually execute some that make-whole on some of the bonds outstanding. And so we actually -- we purchased about $1.2 billion worth of debt in the quarter with positive NPV transactions. And so with the credit profile that we have, our debt cost that we had, this was a tremendous transaction from an NPV perspective, delivering good value for our shareholders here, right?\n So I think we've got the balance sheet into the shape that we would like. We got $10 billion in liquidity. So we can weather any type of additional global slowdown that maybe a second wave of COVID-19 could bring to this company. We have no issues in terms of being able to weather any of the risks associated with the second wave and the impacts there. And we have the dry powder right now for Vince to go pursue the bolt-ons that we've talked about in the past."

Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 cents, up from $0.60 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted segment operating profit was $804 million and our trailing four-quarter adjusted ROIC was 8.1%. I continue to be proud of how our team is performing under challenging and dynamic circumstances. We are fulfilling our purpose by providing high quality nutrition around the globe, and we are doing it while remaining true to our values, protecting the health and safety of our colleagues, fostering a positive, inclusive culture, both within and outside of ADM and safeguarding our environment. Around the globe, ADM colleagues have continued serving our customers and supporting the global food supply chain with no notable disruptions to our operations. Our results are a testament to their dedication, as well as the resilience of our business model and the transformation we have made in our company. Through good times and challenging times, we have kept a strong and steady focus on our strategy. We are not done, but we can be proud of where we are today. Let me share with you some of our accomplishments from the quarter. In our optimize pillar, our Ag Services & Oilseeds team continued their work to enhance the return structure of the business, identifying and executing on almost $50 million in capital reduction initiatives, including the ongoing optimization of our global origination footprint and the decision to exit two Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts businesses. We took further steps to optimize our North American milling operations with announced closure and sale of our Los Angeles flour mill and the sale of office space in Kansas City. And finally, as we previously announced, we made the difficult but important decision to temporarily idle our VCP dry mills in Cedar Rapids and Columbus, which have helped to right size industry ethanol stocks. In our drive pillar, we continued to advance our 1ADM business transformation with the launch of several new technologies, including applications to more efficiently manage spend and cash flow for our non-commodity purchases and contract labor services. We'll be continuing to deploy new 1ADM technologies in the second half of this year. And we expanded our ambitious efforts to make our operations more efficient and environmentally friendly, adding to our previously announced greenhouse gas and energy reduction goals with new commitments to reduce water intensity by a further 10% and achieve a 90% landfill diversion rate by 2035. In our expand pillar, our global destination marketing model continues to grow in export volumes and new markets as ADM extended its product offerings in Asia, Latin America and Europe. We announced that we're introducing high quality USP grade ethanol production in Clinton to complement production at our Peoria facility as we continue to meet customer demand for hand sanitizer. And we announced another expansion of our leadership position in the fast growing plant-based protein market with the creation of PlantPlus Foods, a joint venture with Marfrig that will offer a variety of plant-based food products for customers and consumers across North and South America. Readiness continues to deliver excellence in execution, and its value has never been more clear than over the past few months. Readiness initiative like consolidation of businesses, centralization of activities, and simplification and improvements of processes have significantly enhanced our resilience and agility, helping us continue to serve customers and keep our operations running through fast-changing environments. We are never done improving, and our team has continued to identify and deliver on readiness initiatives. At the end of the second quarter, readiness has allowed us to unlock a total of just over $1 billion in run rate benefits on annual basis since the program began. And based on our strong progress, we're on track to exceed our $1.2 billion goal by the end of 2020. Now, Ray will take us through our business performance before I come back to offer some final comments \u2013 before we answer questions. Ray, please.\nRay Young: Thanks, Juan. Please turn to slide number 4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.85, up from the $0.60 in the prior-year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $804 million, up 18%. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 8.1%, 235 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC of 5.75%. And our trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.6 billion. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 was approximately 14%, very similar to 13% in the prior year and in line with guidance we provided last quarter. For the third and fourth quarters, we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the range of 13% to 15%. We generated $1.6 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the first half of the year, higher than 2019. Return of capital in the first half was $517 million, including a little over $100 million in opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter to help offset dilution. We finished the quarter with net debt to total capital of about 29%. This is down from 31% a year ago. We had cash and available credit capacity at the end of the quarter of almost $11 billion, a very solid amount of liquidity. Capital spending for the first six months was about $360 million. We continue to expect capital spending for the year to be around $800 million, below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion. Slide 5 please. Other businesses were also higher versus the second quarter of 2019, driven by improvements in underwriting results from our captive insurance operations. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $194 million were higher year-over-year due to a larger delta in variable performance-related compensation expense accruals and transfer of costs from business segments into corporate as we centralize certain activities into our centers of excellences. Other charges declined due to improved foreign currency hedging results on intercompany funding and improved investment performance. Corporate results also included debt extinguishment expenses of $14 million related to an early retirement of a bond. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased due to lower average foreign costs related primarily to liability management actions taken in late 2019. Looking forward, we expect unallocated corporate expenses to be in line with our initial $800 million guidance for the calendar year and net interest expense to end similar to or slightly lower than the 2019 amount of about $350 million. Other business results in the second half of the year are expected to be significantly lower than the first half and likely negative based on expected insurance claims settlements and lower interest income in ADM investor services. Please turn to slide 6. Ag Services & Oilseeds delivered higher results versus the second quarter of 2019. Ag Services results were substantially better year-over-year. Strong execution by the team in South America helped deliver record quarterly origination and export volumes in a significantly improved margin environment, driven by a weaker Brazilian real and strong farmer selling. Global trade delivered best second quarter ever, continuing to demonstrate the importance of our strategic efforts to create value throughout the global supply chain. Destination marketing was a significant contributor as countries look to secure stable supplies of food amid the pandemic. Lower inferior grain margins impacted results in North America. Crushing results were lower year-over-year. The team delivered strong global crush volumes overall, and did a great job capitalizing on solid South American meal demand and weaker Brazilian real, along with a lack of Argentinian imports into EMEAI. In North America, margins were impacted by the pandemic's effects on our customers. Net timing impacts to the quarter were not significant as board crush gains were offset by basis losses and our cash flow hedge program deferred additional positive timing impacts. Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year, driven by improved biodiesel volumes and margins in North and South America, as well as strong volumes in margins in refined and packaged oils in South America. Demand was lower for biodiesel in EMEAI and for edible oils \u2013 for food service in both EMEAI and North America. Wilmar results were lower year-over-year. Wilmar's core earnings were strong, but reported earnings were impacted by mark-to-market losses on their investment portfolio in their first quarter. Fundamental global demand trends continue to emphasize the underlying strength and resilience of this industry and our business model. Looking ahead, we expect the pace of Brazilian farmer selling to slow significantly following the aggressive selling in the first half of the year. North American origination should strengthen throughout the second half as we move into the US harvest, and export demand is supported by China's import needs. Global crush margins are likely to remain pressured in the near term, but we expect tight soybean supplies in South America to lead to an improving margin environment as we move through the second half of the year. RPO should continue with solid performance. All told, we currently believe the third quarter will be sequentially lower than the second quarter of this year, followed by a much stronger fourth quarter. Slide 7 please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were similar to the year-ago quarter. Starches and sweetener results were lower year-over-year. COVID-19 related impacts on foodservice demand in North America pressured sweetener volumes. Mark-to-market losses on corn oil contracts indexed to soybean oil also impacted results, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. These impacts were partially offset by lower net raw material costs and positive risk management results. We also continue to benefit from the improvements we made in our Decatur corn complex and the continued turnaround in EMEAI. Wheat milling had another strong quarter as increased levels of home baking in store sales helped drive solid retail demand and footprint optimization initiatives, which reduced costs, continued to drive results. Vantage corn processor results were higher than the second quarter of 2019, driven by favorable risk management results on inventory positions and strong demand for high quality USP grade ethanol used for the hand sanitizer market. While average industry ethanol margins were down versus the prior year, prices and margins improved throughout the quarter as lower production including the two dry mills that we idled and some recovery in driving miles led to falling industry ethanol stocks. Looking ahead, we expect the third quarter results for Carbohydrate Solutions to be similar to the second quarter assuming sweetener demand continues to recover, demand in wheat milling remains solid and average industry ethanol margins over the quarter remain in positive territory. On slide 8, our Nutrition business continued to deliver significant growth, with 35% year-over-year profit improvement for the quarter. Over the first half of the year, adjusted profit for Nutrition is up more than 50%. And despite some COVID-19 impacts, revenue is up about 8% on a constant currency basis, with growth spread across the entire broad portfolio. Human nutrition results were substantially higher in the second quarter of 2020 versus the second quarter of 2019. Flavors continued to deliver solid results as favorable sales mix and margin expansion in North America was offset by some softness in EMEAI. In specialty ingredients, our team's strong execution and operational excellence, including at our soy protein facility in Campo Grande and our pea protein plant in Enderlin enable us to continue to meet rising consumer demand for plant-based proteins and edible beans, driving substantial year-over-year growth. Health and wellness delivered higher performance on strong sales for probiotics, improved volumes and margins in fiber, and additional fermentation income. Animal nutrition results were again higher year-over-year. Despite impacts from COVID-19 on demand in some regions, continued execution on Neovia synergies, robust demand for pet food and treats, and improvement in amino acids drove our ongoing profit growth. The investments we've made in Nutrition and our unique value proposition have positioned us well to support our customers as they continue to innovate and adapt in the current environment. We are winning new business and our pipeline today is strong and growing. We've also equipped our teams with new digital tools and technologies to continue product development work in a virtual environment, ensuring that products advance even in the current dynamic climate. Looking ahead, Nutrition should be around 20% higher in the back half of the year, compared to the second half of 2019, with similar rates of growth in profits in third and fourth quarters. We expect strength in flavors, plant-based proteins, and probiotics continue to drive human nutrition and Neovia synergies and improvements in amino acids to support animal nutrition results. Now, please turn to slide 9. And I'll turn it over back to Juan. Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ray. From our work to optimize our footprint and improve our capital position to our new technologies and improved processes to our growth efforts to become a world leader in nutrition and expand margin opportunities across the value chain, the team has done excellent work executing the strategy. And as we continue on this journey, we are increasingly seeing growing benefits flow to our bottom line. That does not mean that we are immune to external conditions. This has been an unpredictable year and we're only at the halfway point. Our team has done a great job moving quickly and adapting to the challenges of COVID-19, and we are continuing to monitor and analyze purchasing and consuming habits to ensure we can continue to anticipate and meet our customers' needs. We're seeing consumers still largely relying on retail and e-commerce to feed their families and demand is spanning a wide spectrum from comfort foods to healthy choices. In-home eating and baking has dramatically increased the demand for both flour and baked goods. Healthy eating has significantly accelerated the purchase and consumption of alternative proteins. And a focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the mainstream. We're meeting this wide variety of customer needs and will continue to do so as many of these trends advance in the future. For the second half of this year, we'll remain focused on optimizing business performance, advancing readiness and harvesting the benefits of strategic growth initiative investments, especially in our Nutrition segment. We are continuing to pull the levers under our control across the enterprise, with our team currently exceeding our mid-year targets by achieving more than two thirds of our $500 million to $600 million in targeted operating profit improvements for 2020. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our positioning, our capabilities and our strategy and we are excited about the second half of the year and delivering strong earnings and returns in 2020 and beyond. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam, your line is open.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: So, I guess, first, just thinking about how you kind of frame some of the second half outlook for the different businesses, is it fair to say that the biggest wildcard are pace of US exports and what that does both on the origination and crush side and just underlying kind of food ingredient demand? I'm trying to think about kind of the range of outcomes as we think about for business momentum into the second half of the year.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Adam. Listen, as we think about the second half of the year, we expect in general businesses to perform better than in the first half. So, that's overall results. When we think about the different businesses, with the aggressive selling in the first half of the year of the Brazilian farmer, we think that the US having a big crop like we're going to have going into harvest will be the most competitive source and China still needs to import a lot in the fourth quarter. So, we feel good about that. We feel good also about destination marketing. Don't forget that. From an Ag Services perspective results, basically, the results of the global trade were equally contributing as the results of origination in South America for the results this quarter. And although South America will shift to North America in terms of grain results, we see destination marketing and the global trade effort to continue to contribute in the second half. We see probably \u2013 so far, if we look at all the way to July, we see that the worst of the demand destruction due to COVID was behind us. We saw that in April and then we saw improvement in May, June, July. It will probably be uneven and would start and stop for the rest of the year, but we think that the worst is behind us. So, I would say that that's how we characterize. And then, Nutrition continues to grow strong. There are many opportunities for Nutrition and we had a very strong beginning of the year. The second half of the year is seasonally a little bit softer for Nutrition. But that's the way the demand pattern goes every year. But we feel very strongly about the second half of the year at this point.\nAdam Samuelson: All right. That's very helpful color. And then, if I can just ask a second question on capital allocation, just help us think about, with kind of the balance sheet where it is and what seems to be a pretty strong position, what it would take or what you would want to see before you took a more offensive posture on whether it's capital returned to shareholders or maybe there's opportunities in the M&A market that might be emerging?\nJuan Luciano: Sure, yes. Listen, as we have said it all along and at the beginning of the year, our priority remains to deliver our balance sheet to the low 2s and protecting our single-A rating is very important to us. And we have aggressive plans in the businesses to \u2013 you heard me in the accomplishments of the second quarter \u2013 to monetize assets. And to the extent that we continue with that and monetize assets, we will think about increasing our share repurchases. But I think the priority is delevering. But we've been doing very well in this divestiture and we continue to look for our large company and what are the things that we can monetize, so we can apply to that. With regards to M&A, we have a very disciplined process of doing bolt-ons and organic growth. And you see how we pace ourselves. We did WILD in 2014 and we did Neovia in early 2019. And I think that that allows us to recover the ROIC impact. If you think about ROIC at the end of 2018, it was 8.3%. We acquired Neovia and now we're back to that range, 8.1%. So, I think that that allows us to go and buy what we need to buy, continue to grow Nutrition jointly with all the harvesting that we do in Nutrition with the organic growth with Campo Grande and Enderlin and all that. So, I think we have that model and we like it and I think you're going to see that we continue to deliver what we said we were going to do, and it's a very predictable pattern in that trend.\nAdam Samuelson: All right, great. I really appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Heather, your line is open.\nHeather Jones: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Heather.\nHeather Jones: Hi. So, just the details question first. Could you explain to us the results from Vantage Corn was very impressive. Was there a lower cost of market and inventory adjustment or something? Could you help us understand what drove that performance besides the industrial alcohol sales?\nRay Young: Yes, Heather. It's Ray here. Yeah, for Vantage Corn Processor, remember, for VCP, not only are they producing the ethanol from the dry mills, but they're also the distributor of the ethanol that comes out of the wet mills. So, over the course of the quarter, we actually \u2013 as we indicate, we had a very, very good risk management on our inventory positions. Now, we knew coming into the quarter that the fact that we're going to cut back on ethanol production, shut down or idle the two dry mills, we had a pretty good sense of margins should improve throughout the quarter. So, the inventories that VCP had, as we went through the quarter, which includes the wet mill ethanol, we basically more or less left that unhedged, whereas we actually did hedge the corn position at a very, very low cost. And so, we benefit from stable risk management in terms of both the input side, meaning the raw corn, and the output side, which is the ethanol within the distribution system. And so, therefore, we had very, very good risk management results based on our inventory decision. So, that was an important driver. But don't underestimate the industrial ethanol business. We actually increased the capacity of our Peoria plant. It was like 85 million gallons entering the year and we were able to debottleneck many aspects of the plant and actually get that thing closer to 100 million gallons on an annual run rate basis. And we ran the plant full well over the quarter. And as you would appreciate, industrial ethanol margins improved also throughout the quarter. So, VCP also benefited from a very stable environment in terms of the aspects of the industrial ethanol business. And then lastly, again, as we indicated, we idled the plant. We did a pretty good job in terms of reducing the amount of stranded costs associated with those dry mills. And that also contributed towards our overall results. So, overall, it was actually, from our perspective, a good quarter for VCP in terms of how we manage the situation.\nHeather Jones: Yeah, sounds like it. Thank you. My second question is, I was hoping you could elaborate on your outlook for crush margins. So, in the US, you're clearly pretty soft right now and you noted that, over the near term, they'd be soft, but then you articulated a more constructive outlook further out. I was wondering if you could flesh out for us what you're seeing on the demand and supply side that gives you confidence that we should improve as we move into Q4 and 2021.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Heather. As you said, they are soft at the moment in North America, but improving. And we're going to see that improvement over the end of \u2013 through the quarter. Basically, we're going to have \u2013 we started to see a little bit better farmer selling. And I think as we get to the harvest, we're going to have less pressure on that side. And we're seeing from the demand side that the customers \u2013 our customers for soybean meal are coming back. And then, we're seeing also a little bit more pressure on the oil side. So, the oil story is getting a little bit better. So, in general, from crush margins, we saw good crush margins in Europe with the absence of Argentinian meals \u2013 of more aggressive Argentine meal. We saw good crush margins in China. And now, we're seeing improving crush margins in the US for the rest of the year. So, so we feel very good about that business. And we can debate numbers here or there about growth rates, but in general, we see growth going forward. And that's what we're hearing from our customers.\nHeather Jones: Okay, thank you so much.\nJuan Luciano: You're welcome, Heather.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken, your line is now open.\nKenneth Zaslow: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ken.\nKenneth Zaslow: Can you talk about the elevation margins and what you're seeing there? And how meaningful will that be for ADM and how are you executing on that?\nJuan Luciano: Sure. Yes. So, the US export market is setting up for very good times on very solid global demand and competitive prices. And, of course, with a tight supply demand, as I referred before, in South America. So, we do expect large programs for corn, soybeans, as well as wheat and soybean meal for Q4. So, I would say short term in Q2, Q3, it's about $0.10, $0.15. And forward, we're seeing numbers more in the $0.30 range or even slightly better. So, again, we have big volume expectations. And we're looking, Ken, at the full value chain. So, elevation margins and also transportation margin. So, we're seeing the whole thing. So, we care about the full range of margins. So, we feel we feel stronger margins are coming ahead of us for the Q4. And, to be honest, every evidence out there is pointing to that direction as we go around the world and we talk to our teams. So, we feel confident about that.\nKenneth Zaslow: And then, just switching to Nutrition for a second, so two parts to this. One is, obviously, your growth rate has been very strong. How long into the future will that last? Is this a good run rate for a little bit of years? And then, you also mentioned that you're winning new business. Can you quantify or give parameters to how much that is? Is it just typical winning a little business here and there? Or are we talking about larger than a breadbox, but not quite game changing? How do I think about those two things? And I'll leave it there. And I appreciate it.\nJuan Luciano: Sure, Ken. Listen, the thing you need to remember is that Nutrition is still in early stages. So, we were building this business and we've been doing it for four or five years versus other businesses that we've been running for 100 years. So, even as good the resources we're getting, we're not even close to fulfill our potential. And we continue to see that in the pipeline. The pipeline continues to be very strong. And again, we measure the value of the pipeline to see the impact of 2021 sales, 2022 sales. And as I said, that continues to grow. But we also look at the win rates to see how we're doing today. And the win rates continue to increase. I can't disclose exactly the win rates because that's confidential information and it's very valuable to us. I think the important thing of Nutrition that sometimes is underestimated is the breadth of our product offer. And when we're talking here, we're talking, Ken, about \u2013 we're bringing fibers to a lot of products, whether our beverages or yogurts or cereals. We are bringing probiotics to a lot of products. We have specialty proteins. So, I think \u2013 of course, we have flavors going into a myriad of applications. So, I think the versatility that this product gives us \u2013 again, even if you go to specialty proteins, we have soy based, we have pea-based. And when you combine all these things into systems, it gives us incredible possibilities and customers are reacting very well to that value proposition. I have to give credit to the team in this difficult circumstance that you could have thought that maybe innovation could have been impacted because of the remoteness of our operations. And our team pivoted very quickly into establishing virtual tasting rooms, virtual innovation and prototyping sessions. And that has been very successful and has been able to keep the growth rate of our pipeline. So, I don't know how long can we predict the 20% rate. But at this point in time, we continue to see it into the immediate future. So, we don't see any slowdown of that. And as I was explaining to Adam before, we're going to continue to do our bolt-ons M&A, and we've been getting better at this. We integrated and we absorbed Neovia and the results and the operations much faster than we did obviously with WILD because this is the second time and we have perfected the system. And I think we're going to be able to keep this pace a little bit more accelerated into the future. So, the possibilities of this business are enormous, Ken.\nKenneth Zaslow: I really appreciate it. Thank you and be safe.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent, your line is now open.\nSteven Haynes: Hey. This is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Just wanted to come back to the Carb Solutions. The second quarter result was quite a bit better than what you had guided and I appreciate the commentary around risk management. But you also mentioned a number of other buckets. So, can you kind of just bucket out the rest of the beat, so we can get an idea for kind of what drove that delta?\nRay Young: You're referring to Carb Solutions in general for the quarter?\nSteven Haynes: Yeah.\nRay Young: Yeah. You look at starches and sweeteners, the other big sub segment here. We had good results. Naturally, for this segment, as Juan talked about earlier, the trough in terms of demand for sweeteners probably was the second quarter. It was probably in April/May timeframe. And so, therefore, we did experience reductions in volumes on the basis of corn sweeteners during that period. But what was interesting is when you look at starch and sweeteners, there were clearly strengths there as well. Number one, for example, wheat milling. Demand for flour continued to be strong in the second quarter. In fact, when we look at our global wheat milling results, our profits in the second quarter were up 50% versus the prior year. So, that was a big contributor towards the starch and sweetener results. Secondly, I did outline in my remarks that we did have mark-to-market losses on our corn oil contracts, just like we had in the first quarter. The fact I didn't highlight a number indicates that the number was actually much smaller than what we had in the first quarter. But we were also able to offset that impact with good risk management from the wet mills there as well. On a net basis, that was really a neutral impact. And then thirdly, it is important to also highlight in starches and sweeteners, the turnaround efforts, the improve efforts that we launched last year in the Decatur corn complex in the European business. They're truly paying off this year and also in the second quarter. So, they're all positive deltas that help neutralize some of the negative effects that we saw in terms of starches and sweetener volumes in the second quarter. And then, I already talked about VCP, which, again, stable risk management on inventory position. So, overall, I would have to say that, yes, it was actually a very strong quarter for starches and sweeteners in the second quarter compared to even what our initial expectations were as we entered into the quarter. But I have to give the team a lot of credit in terms of the efforts that they executed in order to help deliver the results here.\nSteven Haynes: Okay. Thanks, Ray.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Simonitsch of J.P. Morgan. Tom, your line is open.\nThomas Simonitsch: Thanks. Good morning.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Tom.\nThomas Simonitsch: So, you noted in your press release some COVID-19 impacts on your animal nutrition business. Can you elaborate on that please?\nJuan Luciano: Sure, yes. I think when you see these consumer shifts, of course, Aqua is consumed a lot in the Western Hemisphere in dining out, and so we see a little bit of impact on that \u2013 negative impact, I mean. Of course, when some of the large animals feed, we saw a little bit of softness there in North America and Mexico when some of the meatpacking plants have to slow down. But we see positive benefits in pet food and pet treats. Very positive as well. And I think that, in general, there have been countries where we are strong, that their demand has continued strong, like Brazil has continued, Vietnam has continued. And then, we also saw lysine prices and lysine performance actually came back in the quarter. So, those are kind of the puts and takes of COVID impacting us in animal nutrition.\nThomas Simonitsch: Okay, thanks. And you noted immaterial market impacts in Q2, which was a bit of a surprise to me at least, particularly on soy crush. So, can you elaborate on your hedging strategy and clarify any deferred gains you're carrying into the back half?\nRay Young: Yes, Tom. Recall, the objective of our hedging program is really to manage margin risks on our products and to dampen volatility of earnings and cash flow. And we'll call any impact when it's greater than $50 million. That's what we've done in the past. So, we entered the second quarter with about $80 million of favorable timing effects that would be recognized in the future. And then, as you see in the supplementary data, we exit second quarter with about $95 million of favorable timing effect. So, on net, we had actually $15 million of unfavorable timing effects in the second quarter. Now, with board crush falling dramatically in the second quarter, we naturally did have hedge gains on crush. Now, some were deferred due to our cash flow hedge program, which we put in place several years ago, right? And so, although for these gains, they are basically under our cash flow hedge accounting, you don't have to mark-to-market. They're just simply deferred in the future and we'll recognize that. But we did also recognize some timing effects related to basis movements on oil, meal and beans, right? So, therefore, the favorable effect on board crush was offset by some of the unfavorable timing effects on basis movements. And as a result, we had a slight negative impact of $15 million. And again, we didn't call it out in our prepared remarks, but you can actually see that in the data there. The other thing to just note also, we also had some bunker fuel hedges and we call that out in the first quarter, right? Some unfavorable effects on bunker fuel hedges that should reverse out in the second quarter. And we did. We did have some favorable reversals. But, again, nothing significant in terms of size, and that's the reason why we didn't call it out. But in general, I'd have to say, our cash flow hedge program is actually something that helps smooth out some of the fluctuations that we have on our hedging. And then, there's also some other impacts that actually impact the net amount. But again, I think the key is that we saw about $95 million of favorable timing effects that will reverse out over the future quarters.\nThomas Simonitsch: That's very helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Ben, your line is open.\nBenjamin Bienvenu: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to revisit the Vantage segment. I know in April when you guys decided the closure of two dry mills, you talked about kind of a four-month timeline. Recognizing you might not want to telegraph too much the timing of the reopening, what are you looking for from a market perspective as you think about reopening, either sticking to that timeframe or oscillating around the original timeline that you laid out?\nRay Young: Yeah, we did indicate that when we temporarily idled the two facilities. We said that we'll probably keep it down for about four months, which will, frankly, bring us to the end of the third quarter. I think the data that we're going to look at includes things such as industry ethanol levels, and it's actually very encouraging what we've seen recently where EIA data on ethanol and industry stocks, inventory level, they've come down from the peak of 27 million barrels down to about 20 million barrels right now. So, that's actually very, very encouraging. And you have seen ethanol margins respond accordingly with that particular reduction in terms of inventory. The other key variable is just the recovery of driving miles. And you're actually starting to see that. We were down as much as 40% during the trough of the shelter-in-place in terms of gasoline demand. We're starting to see some level of recovery. We're probably down as an industry about 15% right now. And so, I think that some of the key data that we're going to look at is how that recovery continues, how the inventory levels get maintained as we go through the next several months and how the margin environment evolves, and that will guide us also in terms of the appropriate timing to kind of restart both dry mills here. So, it is a dynamic \u2013 it's a dynamic situation, but we're going to be very data driven as we look towards the strategy here.\nBenjamin Bienvenu: Okay, thanks for that. Following up on just the questions around hedging, how exposed are you to the cash market? How much of 3Q have you hedged? And have you hedged any of your 4Q crush commitments?\nRay Young: Normally, in terms of crush, we normally kind of hedge the fourth quarter significantly, not 100%. But, normally, we're hedged, I think, 50%, 75%. Normally. We're always opportunistic, by the way too. We'll look at the levels and we'll determine when we layer in the levels. And then, as you go out into the future quarters, there's less. But we also do have hedges already in 2021 based upon the stable levels that we saw earlier in the year.\nBenjamin Bienvenu: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Michael, your line is now open.\nMichael Piken: Yeah, hi. I just wanted to get an update a little bit in terms of how you sort of see the US-China trade situation playing out. Do you think that China is going to be able to meet all the phase one commitments and then just sort of any update you have on ASF over in China and how quickly they're rebuilding and what that means for meal demand over there?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah, Mike. Listen, I think you heard me saying before. I think that China is taking all the actions that reflect their intention to comply with this. Despite their rhetoric, we continue to focus on the facts. The facts are that they have imported more from the US, if you look at corn or if you look at soybeans so far, versus last year. And the reality, there is also a supply/demand reality here. Brazil is out of beans. The Argentine farmer is not going to sell their beans. So, the US is going to be having a big harvest. And I think China, if you think about, they're going to import 95 million tons, 96 million tons and they have imported already 70 million tons, give or take, from South America. So, they need to import about 25 million tons, 26 million tons, of which they have already committed half of that. So, half of this is still to be done, which I think is going to be done from the US in the Q4. So, we feel good about that. And as I answered before to Ken in elevation margins, I think there's going to be corn, it's going to be soybean meal, it's going to be soy, and it's going to be wheat. So, it's going to be a good program for the US in terms of volumes. In terms of ASF, I think that ASF has been evolving as we predicted early on, in which that created a 10 million tons gap of protein in China. China has covered some of that with imports and we've seen those imports up around the world. We enjoy that, especially from Brazil this second quarter. And I think we've seen that growing into the US as well. We also saw the professionalization of animal processing in China. And with that, we've seen the increase of soybean meals in the rations and more efficient rations. So, will it be lineal? Probably like COVID, this will not be lineal. There are going to be ups and downs. There are going to a surge here or there that's going to be squashed. But I think that, overall, we've seen the worst. And I think that we're going to see probably full recovery by some time later 2022 or something like that, but it's going to be an in crescendo from here.\nMichael Piken: Great. And then, now last of is just on the destination marketing increases here that you guys talked about. When can we start to see that accrue to the P&L and what does the margin profile look like on destination marketing compared to the North American operations? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Destination marketing has been impacting us already. As I said, when I said global trade had a record second quarter, that's what's driving a lot of that. This is a strategy we put three, four, five years ago. And to be honest, it's been emphasized now with people around the world more concerned about the stability of the supply chains and the ability to move product around, which we've been able to move. But having product locally has been very valuable for a lot of customers around the world. So, we made acquisitions in Egypt, in Israel. We opened some offices and we continue to expand the number of countries in Asia, in Europe and in South America that we are covering with that. So, at the beginning, we saw an expansion in volumes. We doubled the volumes. Now, volumes are growing a little bit more geographically, not in the same place, I would say. It's more by geographic expansion. And margins continue to increase. So, we feel good about it. And it's a big contributor and it was already a big contributor of our services for the first half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katter with Baird. David, your line is now open.\nDavid Katter: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning.\nDavid Katter: Quickly wanted to clarify or get an update on your strategic review for ethanol. Where in the process are we and kind of how has COVID impacted that and what options are being considered?\nRay Young: The review is continuing. We have interested parties in the assets. Naturally, in the COVID-19 environment when the dry mills are shut down, the credit markets are basically shut down, we've taken a little bit of a pause. But, clearly, we expect the process to recommence as we kind of move through the back part of the year, as the markets start recovering back to more of a normality.\nDavid Katter: Got it. And then, one more I just kind of want to hear your thoughts on. The readiness initiative, it's on track to beat its goal, I think you mentioned. But how does the focus shift? Or how does your mentality change once you achieve that $1.2 billion goal? Kind of what's the next step for ADM's readiness?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, this is a large company and a growing company. So, as we continue to look for opportunities or buckets of opportunity, we continue to find more. So, everything that we do, David, is run into readiness, which is a way to execute better all our initiative. So, I think that the first stage, if you will, was more on efficiencies. We are shifting a little bit more to growth and innovation and to make sure that our growth and innovation has the same capabilities and power to execute the deficiency it has. But I will say, from a numbers perspective, we feel very good about the $200 million to $300 million of net impact that we get every year. And we don't see any reason for that not to be in the forecast for next year, maybe even a little bit better. So, we feel good about that. I will say if you look at \u2013 if I take the opportunity of your question to speak a little bit about the algorithm and how we're thinking for next year, the harvesting part, there's still more in front of us and we continue to see impact of that and probably growing. Maybe hopefully improve will be less so because we are improving those businesses and we don't have that many more businesses to improve maybe. And readiness continue to enlarge the scope. So, the impact of revenues should continue to grow over time.\nDavid Katter: That's excellent. Thank you, guys.\nRay Young: Thank you.\nRay Young: Amy, any more questions? Amy?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Theurer of Barclays. Ben, your line is now open.\nBenjamin Theurer: Thank you very much. Good morning, Juan, Ray. Hope you're both well.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning.\nRay Young: Thank you, Ben.\nBenjamin Theurer: Good stuff. Just one quick one and a follow-up. So, within the Carbohydrate Solutions segment, you've also had mentioned that wheat had a very strong performance and I think you said on the call something like it was up 50%. I know it's small, but just out of curiosity, what are you seeing in the month of July and into the rest of 3Q and maybe a little ahead into 4Q on the wheat part within the Carbohydrate Solution business?\nRay Young: The demand for flour continues to be strong. Probably, first quarter, we saw a little bit of a surge because of pantry loading. But the demand effects continue to be solid for wheat, and hence our mills are actually running very, very hard. Now, the other big contributor, don't forget, is just the optimization initiatives that we had in our wheat processing plants. So, we actually shut down some inefficient mills and opened up new mills. The timing cannot be more perfect for that, right? Because the demand is there for our products. And now, we actually produce the flour from very efficient operations. And that has been actually an important contributor towards our overall improvement in terms of results for wheat milling. So, we're actually very, very pleased in terms of how this strategy has unfolded here.\nBenjamin Theurer: Okay, perfect. And then, a little more medium, long term. Clearly \u2013 and you maybe talked a lot about Brazilian farmer selling was very strong and I think you had in the presentation the status [ph], where they stand. So, what are you seeing on the ground? What's your expectation into the second season in Brazil and then maybe into next year? What are you seeing on the ground in terms of intention to plant just because of what they've been selling so strong right now? Do you see any significant uptick in volume in Brazil that could become a competitor for us in a more relevant way maybe looking into 2021?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. I think, Ben, we will continue to see Brazil adding a little bit of area. And I expect to have a large crop next year in Brazil weather permitting. So, I think that we will continue to see that and we have a strong origination team and crush team in Brazil. And I think we're going to continue to profit from that. I think there is a place for US and for Brazil. So, I think it's just the \u2013 I would say the short-term dynamics depends in South America a lot of what happened with currency. And you see the stark contrast between an Argentine farmer that see no benefit in parting ways with the crop, with the Brazilian farmer that due to the weak real was an aggressive seller even of the new crop. So, I think those dynamics will happen, but I think, over time, Brazil will try to continue to increase production.\nBenjamin Theurer: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. And congratulations on the results.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano: Hello, Amy?\nRay Young: Hello, Amy?\nJuan Luciano: Any questions?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Anderson with Stifel. Vincent, your line is open.\nVincent Anderson: Thanks for sliding me in. Good morning and nice quarter. I did just want to clarify a little bit more on the positive mix shift in Nutrition. You called out growth in flavors and probiotics. Are those generally going to be higher margin contributors? And then, also on plant proteins, was that also representative of positive to mix or was it more of that margins in the protein business were improving as you fill the Campo Grande facility?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. A little bit of both. Certainly, Enderlin and Campo Grande are both new facilities. So, they are both getting better every quarter on what did they do. The EBITDA percentage of sales, as you know that I follow that, in the business continued to evolve favorably. If you look at the previous-year quarter was 11.3%. And this quarter was 15.1%. So, of course, our team is very agile, lean, to bring in new products and the new products bring new opportunities for margin up the business. So, we have those benefits. Probiotics are, of course \u2013 microbiome was a trend that was incipient, if you will, and COVID has put it right into the mainstream as people think about more health and wellness and immunity concerns. So, I would say probiotics that are science based, like ours, are being added as supplements to many, many products. And those products are highly technical. As I said, they require clinical trials and things like that. So, of course, they command higher margins. So, we feel very good about those products. And flavors, listen, flavors are incredibly important. All these things have to be taken by people and they have to taste good. So, the combination of our scientists creating these flavors and masking maybe different nodes that maybe people don't appreciate is critical to this. And that's one of the reasons we acquired WILD Flavors at that point in time because of those capabilities. When you combine those capabilities with the fact that all our flavors or 95% plus of our flavors are natural, that makes this the preferred solution for most of our customers and certainly for the consumers. So, we feel very good about that.\nVincent Anderson: All right. Thanks. To keep everybody on schedule, I'll just leave it there. Nice job again. Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vince.\nRay Young: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Eric Larson with Seaport Global. Eric, your line is open.\nEric Larson: Yeah. Thanks for sneaking me in. Congratulations on a great quarter, guys.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Eric. Welcome back.\nEric Larson: Well, thank you. It's good to be back. It's a pleasure. So, just one really kind of technical question. It comes to the \u2013 and then I have a broader question. But the technical question is, we've got elevation margins right now in the Gulf ports that I haven't seen in quite some time. And just put China aside for a minute, there's good demand \u2013 there are a lot of other places outside of China. Obviously, the US dollar is helping a little bit. If you think that COVID-19 has maybe put some scare into some other countries, maybe they've loaded some inventory to make sure that they've got enough grain supplies for their people, et cetera, and some of that demand might taper off or are they actually using the products that they're shipping? I'm curious on the demand factor outside of China.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah, I would say probably at the beginning of the year, we saw a little bit more of that, Eric. I think now is through demand that is coming through. I think that even through all the peak of the crisis, we've been able to manage every port. We've been able to keep our operations running, the protocols that we have with the crews of the vessels and the different ports have worked well. So, I would say probably early on, maybe March, April, maybe people thought a little bit more about hoarding product. I don't think that's true anymore. I think now we're seeing through demand. What is happening with that demand is looking like strong demand and strong volumes for the US. So, potentially, we could have record profits in Q4 when you look at the volumes plus the attractive prices because we're going to have a big harvest in the US. We're talking about large volumes for North America and we're talking about large crop and maybe even an early corn crop. So, we feel very good about that progress. And that's what you heard me saying before. In general, we look at the second half. And I look at my businesses and I think my businesses are going to perform better in the second half than in the first half. So, overall, the profit coming from the businesses should be stronger in the second half than in the first half.\nEric Larson: Yeah. We're going to have an outstanding harvest this year. And it's going to make us very competitive globally. I would agree with that. So, the other question here that I have \u2013 I have two small questions. One, we're starting to see estimates for Brazilian \u2013 for next year, for Brazilian soybean production \u2013 starting to see estimates north of 130 million metric tons. We're seeing \u2013 continue to see global production expansion across all of the major production countries. And my real question is here, obviously, the world is growing as well. Are we going to have enough demand over the next, let's say, three to five years to sell all this product? Or are some countries going to have to cede some share, export share, as this production continues to grow pretty rapidly? It's a longer-term question, but does demand and production match?\nJuan Luciano: I do believe so. When we look at the \u2013 we've been adding like 2 billion people every 30 years here in the world. And when you see how China is recovering \u2013 remember that this virus hit us from the east, coming West. So, we've seen how China is recovering, how Europe is recovering. Of course, still the Americas are in the middle of the pandemic, but we need all that. I think my concerns are not, are we going to find enough demand for that volume. I think we still \u2013 on the biggest issue for China and a lot of countries is food security, Eric. And when I go around the world and talk to mandatories and all that, the biggest concern is that, are we going to see \u2013 do you have enough investment in infrastructure? Do you have the ports ready to bring all those products? So, we are not hearing a lot of issues with demand.\nEric Larson: Okay. And then \u2013 the one last question, and I'm sorry to ask so many \u2013 obviously, Nutrition is just doing exceptionally well and you've had a lot of investment in there and it's actually performing the way you have said it's going to. Not to pin you to any kind of a guidance number, Juan, in the past, you have shared what you thought nutrition could be as a contributor to the overall company over the long run. Could you give us an update on your thoughts on that? Because that's truly a new delta for the company.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Statistically, Eric, I always have \u2013 we always have two norths, if you will. One is, we want to get to the 10% ROIC. And the second is, we saw the opportunity to bring growth into the company with extending our value chain into Nutrition. And we always say \u2013 you heard me saying, we think that that's a business that could get easily to 25%, 30% of our profits, and it continues to move into that. And to be honest, its moving probably has accelerated into that number, so we might revisit that number. So, we don't have a specific number. But all I wanted to express at that point in time is it will be a meaningful contributor because we saw the opportunity, we saw the potential for that business. And now, I think that everybody else is realizing. At the beginning, we were in an investment phase. So, to a certain degree, some of that performance was masked. But now, we're looking at what we're doing in \u2013 look at WFSI. WFSI grew 27%. Of course, animal nutrition grew much more than that. And when we look at all the microbiome potential there, that's an incredible accelerator that is still very small. So, I think I answered before to Ken. You have to remember, this is at the beginnings of what we can uncover in terms of profitability. We are just delivering while we are building the business, but there is much more that will come from Nutrition. And I think that if our track record serves us giving you confidence, trust us, much more is coming from Nutrition.\nEric Larson: Thank you very much. Have a good day.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session I will now turn the call back over to Victoria de la Huerga for closing remarks.\nVictoria de la Huerga: Thank you for joining us today. Slide 10 notes upcoming investor events in which we will be participating. As always, please feel free to follow-up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Victoria. Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 cents, up from $0.60 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted segment operating profit was $804 million and our trailing four-quarter adjusted ROIC was 8.1%. I continue to be proud of how our team is performing under challenging and dynamic circumstances. We are fulfilling our purpose by providing high quality nutrition around the globe, and we are doing it while remaining true to our values, protecting the health and safety of our colleagues, fostering a positive, inclusive culture, both within and outside of ADM and safeguarding our environment. Around the globe, ADM colleagues have continued serving our customers and supporting the global food supply chain with no notable disruptions to our operations. Our results are a testament to their dedication, as well as the resilience of our business model and the transformation we have made in our company. Through good times and challenging times, we have kept a strong and steady focus on our strategy. We are not done, but we can be proud of where we are today. Let me share with you some of our accomplishments from the quarter. In our optimize pillar, our Ag Services & Oilseeds team continued their work to enhance the return structure of the business, identifying and executing on almost $50 million in capital reduction initiatives, including the ongoing optimization of our global origination footprint and the decision to exit two Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts businesses. We took further steps to optimize our North American milling operations with announced closure and sale of our Los Angeles flour mill and the sale of office space in Kansas City. And finally, as we previously announced, we made the difficult but important decision to temporarily idle our VCP dry mills in Cedar Rapids and Columbus, which have helped to right size industry ethanol stocks. In our drive pillar, we continued to advance our 1ADM business transformation with the launch of several new technologies, including applications to more efficiently manage spend and cash flow for our non-commodity purchases and contract labor services. We'll be continuing to deploy new 1ADM technologies in the second half of this year. And we expanded our ambitious efforts to make our operations more efficient and environmentally friendly, adding to our previously announced greenhouse gas and energy reduction goals with new commitments to reduce water intensity by a further 10% and achieve a 90% landfill diversion rate by 2035. In our expand pillar, our global destination marketing model continues to grow in export volumes and new markets as ADM extended its product offerings in Asia, Latin America and Europe. We announced that we're introducing high quality USP grade ethanol production in Clinton to complement production at our Peoria facility as we continue to meet customer demand for hand sanitizer. And we announced another expansion of our leadership position in the fast growing plant-based protein market with the creation of PlantPlus Foods, a joint venture with Marfrig that will offer a variety of plant-based food products for customers and consumers across North and South America. Readiness continues to deliver excellence in execution, and its value has never been more clear than over the past few months. Readiness initiative like consolidation of businesses, centralization of activities, and simplification and improvements of processes have significantly enhanced our resilience and agility, helping us continue to serve customers and keep our operations running through fast-changing environments. We are never done improving, and our team has continued to identify and deliver on readiness initiatives. At the end of the second quarter, readiness has allowed us to unlock a total of just over $1 billion in run rate benefits on annual basis since the program began. And based on our strong progress, we're on track to exceed our $1.2 billion goal by the end of 2020. Now, Ray will take us through our business performance before I come back to offer some final comments \u2013 before we answer questions. Ray, please. Thank you, Ray. From our work to optimize our footprint and improve our capital position to our new technologies and improved processes to our growth efforts to become a world leader in nutrition and expand margin opportunities across the value chain, the team has done excellent work executing the strategy. And as we continue on this journey, we are increasingly seeing growing benefits flow to our bottom line. That does not mean that we are immune to external conditions. This has been an unpredictable year and we're only at the halfway point. Our team has done a great job moving quickly and adapting to the challenges of COVID-19, and we are continuing to monitor and analyze purchasing and consuming habits to ensure we can continue to anticipate and meet our customers' needs. We're seeing consumers still largely relying on retail and e-commerce to feed their families and demand is spanning a wide spectrum from comfort foods to healthy choices. In-home eating and baking has dramatically increased the demand for both flour and baked goods. Healthy eating has significantly accelerated the purchase and consumption of alternative proteins. And a focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the mainstream. We're meeting this wide variety of customer needs and will continue to do so as many of these trends advance in the future. For the second half of this year, we'll remain focused on optimizing business performance, advancing readiness and harvesting the benefits of strategic growth initiative investments, especially in our Nutrition segment. We are continuing to pull the levers under our control across the enterprise, with our team currently exceeding our mid-year targets by achieving more than two thirds of our $500 million to $600 million in targeted operating profit improvements for 2020. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our positioning, our capabilities and our strategy and we are excited about the second half of the year and delivering strong earnings and returns in 2020 and beyond. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Good morning, Adam. Thank you, Adam. Listen, as we think about the second half of the year, we expect in general businesses to perform better than in the first half. So, that's overall results. When we think about the different businesses, with the aggressive selling in the first half of the year of the Brazilian farmer, we think that the US having a big crop like we're going to have going into harvest will be the most competitive source and China still needs to import a lot in the fourth quarter. So, we feel good about that. We feel good also about destination marketing. Don't forget that. From an Ag Services perspective results, basically, the results of the global trade were equally contributing as the results of origination in South America for the results this quarter. And although South America will shift to North America in terms of grain results, we see destination marketing and the global trade effort to continue to contribute in the second half. We see probably \u2013 so far, if we look at all the way to July, we see that the worst of the demand destruction due to COVID was behind us. We saw that in April and then we saw improvement in May, June, July. It will probably be uneven and would start and stop for the rest of the year, but we think that the worst is behind us. So, I would say that that's how we characterize. And then, Nutrition continues to grow strong. There are many opportunities for Nutrition and we had a very strong beginning of the year. The second half of the year is seasonally a little bit softer for Nutrition. But that's the way the demand pattern goes every year. But we feel very strongly about the second half of the year at this point. Sure, yes. Listen, as we have said it all along and at the beginning of the year, our priority remains to deliver our balance sheet to the low 2s and protecting our single-A rating is very important to us. And we have aggressive plans in the businesses to \u2013 you heard me in the accomplishments of the second quarter \u2013 to monetize assets. And to the extent that we continue with that and monetize assets, we will think about increasing our share repurchases. But I think the priority is delevering. But we've been doing very well in this divestiture and we continue to look for our large company and what are the things that we can monetize, so we can apply to that. With regards to M&A, we have a very disciplined process of doing bolt-ons and organic growth. And you see how we pace ourselves. We did WILD in 2014 and we did Neovia in early 2019. And I think that that allows us to recover the ROIC impact. If you think about ROIC at the end of 2018, it was 8.3%. We acquired Neovia and now we're back to that range, 8.1%. So, I think that that allows us to go and buy what we need to buy, continue to grow Nutrition jointly with all the harvesting that we do in Nutrition with the organic growth with Campo Grande and Enderlin and all that. So, I think we have that model and we like it and I think you're going to see that we continue to deliver what we said we were going to do, and it's a very predictable pattern in that trend. Thank you, Adam. Good morning, Heather. Yeah. Thank you, Heather. As you said, they are soft at the moment in North America, but improving. And we're going to see that improvement over the end of \u2013 through the quarter. Basically, we're going to have \u2013 we started to see a little bit better farmer selling. And I think as we get to the harvest, we're going to have less pressure on that side. And we're seeing from the demand side that the customers \u2013 our customers for soybean meal are coming back. And then, we're seeing also a little bit more pressure on the oil side. So, the oil story is getting a little bit better. So, in general, from crush margins, we saw good crush margins in Europe with the absence of Argentinian meals \u2013 of more aggressive Argentine meal. We saw good crush margins in China. And now, we're seeing improving crush margins in the US for the rest of the year. So, so we feel very good about that business. And we can debate numbers here or there about growth rates, but in general, we see growth going forward. And that's what we're hearing from our customers. You're welcome, Heather. Good morning, Ken. Sure. Yes. So, the US export market is setting up for very good times on very solid global demand and competitive prices. And, of course, with a tight supply demand, as I referred before, in South America. So, we do expect large programs for corn, soybeans, as well as wheat and soybean meal for Q4. So, I would say short term in Q2, Q3, it's about $0.10, $0.15. And forward, we're seeing numbers more in the $0.30 range or even slightly better. So, again, we have big volume expectations. And we're looking, Ken, at the full value chain. So, elevation margins and also transportation margin. So, we're seeing the whole thing. So, we care about the full range of margins. So, we feel we feel stronger margins are coming ahead of us for the Q4. And, to be honest, every evidence out there is pointing to that direction as we go around the world and we talk to our teams. So, we feel confident about that. Sure, Ken. Listen, the thing you need to remember is that Nutrition is still in early stages. So, we were building this business and we've been doing it for four or five years versus other businesses that we've been running for 100 years. So, even as good the resources we're getting, we're not even close to fulfill our potential. And we continue to see that in the pipeline. The pipeline continues to be very strong. And again, we measure the value of the pipeline to see the impact of 2021 sales, 2022 sales. And as I said, that continues to grow. But we also look at the win rates to see how we're doing today. And the win rates continue to increase. I can't disclose exactly the win rates because that's confidential information and it's very valuable to us. I think the important thing of Nutrition that sometimes is underestimated is the breadth of our product offer. And when we're talking here, we're talking, Ken, about \u2013 we're bringing fibers to a lot of products, whether our beverages or yogurts or cereals. We are bringing probiotics to a lot of products. We have specialty proteins. So, I think \u2013 of course, we have flavors going into a myriad of applications. So, I think the versatility that this product gives us \u2013 again, even if you go to specialty proteins, we have soy based, we have pea-based. And when you combine all these things into systems, it gives us incredible possibilities and customers are reacting very well to that value proposition. I have to give credit to the team in this difficult circumstance that you could have thought that maybe innovation could have been impacted because of the remoteness of our operations. And our team pivoted very quickly into establishing virtual tasting rooms, virtual innovation and prototyping sessions. And that has been very successful and has been able to keep the growth rate of our pipeline. So, I don't know how long can we predict the 20% rate. But at this point in time, we continue to see it into the immediate future. So, we don't see any slowdown of that. And as I was explaining to Adam before, we're going to continue to do our bolt-ons M&A, and we've been getting better at this. We integrated and we absorbed Neovia and the results and the operations much faster than we did obviously with WILD because this is the second time and we have perfected the system. And I think we're going to be able to keep this pace a little bit more accelerated into the future. So, the possibilities of this business are enormous, Ken. Thank you. Good morning, Tom. Sure, yes. I think when you see these consumer shifts, of course, Aqua is consumed a lot in the Western Hemisphere in dining out, and so we see a little bit of impact on that \u2013 negative impact, I mean. Of course, when some of the large animals feed, we saw a little bit of softness there in North America and Mexico when some of the meatpacking plants have to slow down. But we see positive benefits in pet food and pet treats. Very positive as well. And I think that, in general, there have been countries where we are strong, that their demand has continued strong, like Brazil has continued, Vietnam has continued. And then, we also saw lysine prices and lysine performance actually came back in the quarter. So, those are kind of the puts and takes of COVID impacting us in animal nutrition. Yeah, Mike. Listen, I think you heard me saying before. I think that China is taking all the actions that reflect their intention to comply with this. Despite their rhetoric, we continue to focus on the facts. The facts are that they have imported more from the US, if you look at corn or if you look at soybeans so far, versus last year. And the reality, there is also a supply/demand reality here. Brazil is out of beans. The Argentine farmer is not going to sell their beans. So, the US is going to be having a big harvest. And I think China, if you think about, they're going to import 95 million tons, 96 million tons and they have imported already 70 million tons, give or take, from South America. So, they need to import about 25 million tons, 26 million tons, of which they have already committed half of that. So, half of this is still to be done, which I think is going to be done from the US in the Q4. So, we feel good about that. And as I answered before to Ken in elevation margins, I think there's going to be corn, it's going to be soybean meal, it's going to be soy, and it's going to be wheat. So, it's going to be a good program for the US in terms of volumes. In terms of ASF, I think that ASF has been evolving as we predicted early on, in which that created a 10 million tons gap of protein in China. China has covered some of that with imports and we've seen those imports up around the world. We enjoy that, especially from Brazil this second quarter. And I think we've seen that growing into the US as well. We also saw the professionalization of animal processing in China. And with that, we've seen the increase of soybean meals in the rations and more efficient rations. So, will it be lineal? Probably like COVID, this will not be lineal. There are going to be ups and downs. There are going to a surge here or there that's going to be squashed. But I think that, overall, we've seen the worst. And I think that we're going to see probably full recovery by some time later 2022 or something like that, but it's going to be an in crescendo from here. Yeah. Destination marketing has been impacting us already. As I said, when I said global trade had a record second quarter, that's what's driving a lot of that. This is a strategy we put three, four, five years ago. And to be honest, it's been emphasized now with people around the world more concerned about the stability of the supply chains and the ability to move product around, which we've been able to move. But having product locally has been very valuable for a lot of customers around the world. So, we made acquisitions in Egypt, in Israel. We opened some offices and we continue to expand the number of countries in Asia, in Europe and in South America that we are covering with that. So, at the beginning, we saw an expansion in volumes. We doubled the volumes. Now, volumes are growing a little bit more geographically, not in the same place, I would say. It's more by geographic expansion. And margins continue to increase. So, we feel good about it. And it's a big contributor and it was already a big contributor of our services for the first half of the year. Good morning. Yes, this is a large company and a growing company. So, as we continue to look for opportunities or buckets of opportunity, we continue to find more. So, everything that we do, David, is run into readiness, which is a way to execute better all our initiative. So, I think that the first stage, if you will, was more on efficiencies. We are shifting a little bit more to growth and innovation and to make sure that our growth and innovation has the same capabilities and power to execute the deficiency it has. But I will say, from a numbers perspective, we feel very good about the $200 million to $300 million of net impact that we get every year. And we don't see any reason for that not to be in the forecast for next year, maybe even a little bit better. So, we feel good about that. I will say if you look at \u2013 if I take the opportunity of your question to speak a little bit about the algorithm and how we're thinking for next year, the harvesting part, there's still more in front of us and we continue to see impact of that and probably growing. Maybe hopefully improve will be less so because we are improving those businesses and we don't have that many more businesses to improve maybe. And readiness continue to enlarge the scope. So, the impact of revenues should continue to grow over time. Good morning. Yeah. I think, Ben, we will continue to see Brazil adding a little bit of area. And I expect to have a large crop next year in Brazil weather permitting. So, I think that we will continue to see that and we have a strong origination team and crush team in Brazil. And I think we're going to continue to profit from that. I think there is a place for US and for Brazil. So, I think it's just the \u2013 I would say the short-term dynamics depends in South America a lot of what happened with currency. And you see the stark contrast between an Argentine farmer that see no benefit in parting ways with the crop, with the Brazilian farmer that due to the weak real was an aggressive seller even of the new crop. So, I think those dynamics will happen, but I think, over time, Brazil will try to continue to increase production. Thank you very much. Hello, Amy? Any questions? Yeah. A little bit of both. Certainly, Enderlin and Campo Grande are both new facilities. So, they are both getting better every quarter on what did they do. The EBITDA percentage of sales, as you know that I follow that, in the business continued to evolve favorably. If you look at the previous-year quarter was 11.3%. And this quarter was 15.1%. So, of course, our team is very agile, lean, to bring in new products and the new products bring new opportunities for margin up the business. So, we have those benefits. Probiotics are, of course \u2013 microbiome was a trend that was incipient, if you will, and COVID has put it right into the mainstream as people think about more health and wellness and immunity concerns. So, I would say probiotics that are science based, like ours, are being added as supplements to many, many products. And those products are highly technical. As I said, they require clinical trials and things like that. So, of course, they command higher margins. So, we feel very good about those products. And flavors, listen, flavors are incredibly important. All these things have to be taken by people and they have to taste good. So, the combination of our scientists creating these flavors and masking maybe different nodes that maybe people don't appreciate is critical to this. And that's one of the reasons we acquired WILD Flavors at that point in time because of those capabilities. When you combine those capabilities with the fact that all our flavors or 95% plus of our flavors are natural, that makes this the preferred solution for most of our customers and certainly for the consumers. So, we feel very good about that. Thank you, Vince. Thank you, Eric. Welcome back. Yeah, I would say probably at the beginning of the year, we saw a little bit more of that, Eric. I think now is through demand that is coming through. I think that even through all the peak of the crisis, we've been able to manage every port. We've been able to keep our operations running, the protocols that we have with the crews of the vessels and the different ports have worked well. So, I would say probably early on, maybe March, April, maybe people thought a little bit more about hoarding product. I don't think that's true anymore. I think now we're seeing through demand. What is happening with that demand is looking like strong demand and strong volumes for the US. So, potentially, we could have record profits in Q4 when you look at the volumes plus the attractive prices because we're going to have a big harvest in the US. We're talking about large volumes for North America and we're talking about large crop and maybe even an early corn crop. So, we feel very good about that progress. And that's what you heard me saying before. In general, we look at the second half. And I look at my businesses and I think my businesses are going to perform better in the second half than in the first half. So, overall, the profit coming from the businesses should be stronger in the second half than in the first half. I do believe so. When we look at the \u2013 we've been adding like 2 billion people every 30 years here in the world. And when you see how China is recovering \u2013 remember that this virus hit us from the east, coming West. So, we've seen how China is recovering, how Europe is recovering. Of course, still the Americas are in the middle of the pandemic, but we need all that. I think my concerns are not, are we going to find enough demand for that volume. I think we still \u2013 on the biggest issue for China and a lot of countries is food security, Eric. And when I go around the world and talk to mandatories and all that, the biggest concern is that, are we going to see \u2013 do you have enough investment in infrastructure? Do you have the ports ready to bring all those products? So, we are not hearing a lot of issues with demand. Yeah. Statistically, Eric, I always have \u2013 we always have two norths, if you will. One is, we want to get to the 10% ROIC. And the second is, we saw the opportunity to bring growth into the company with extending our value chain into Nutrition. And we always say \u2013 you heard me saying, we think that that's a business that could get easily to 25%, 30% of our profits, and it continues to move into that. And to be honest, its moving probably has accelerated into that number, so we might revisit that number. So, we don't have a specific number. But all I wanted to express at that point in time is it will be a meaningful contributor because we saw the opportunity, we saw the potential for that business. And now, I think that everybody else is realizing. At the beginning, we were in an investment phase. So, to a certain degree, some of that performance was masked. But now, we're looking at what we're doing in \u2013 look at WFSI. WFSI grew 27%. Of course, animal nutrition grew much more than that. And when we look at all the microbiome potential there, that's an incredible accelerator that is still very small. So, I think I answered before to Ken. You have to remember, this is at the beginnings of what we can uncover in terms of profitability. We are just delivering while we are building the business, but there is much more that will come from Nutrition. And I think that if our track record serves us giving you confidence, trust us, much more is coming from Nutrition. Thank you, Eric."

            "content": "Thanks, Juan. Please turn to slide number 4. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.85, up from the $0.60 in the prior-year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $804 million, up 18%. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 8.1%, 235 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC of 5.75%. And our trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.6 billion. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 was approximately 14%, very similar to 13% in the prior year and in line with guidance we provided last quarter. For the third and fourth quarters, we continue to expect an effective tax rate in the range of 13% to 15%. We generated $1.6 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the first half of the year, higher than 2019. Return of capital in the first half was $517 million, including a little over $100 million in opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter to help offset dilution. We finished the quarter with net debt to total capital of about 29%. This is down from 31% a year ago. We had cash and available credit capacity at the end of the quarter of almost $11 billion, a very solid amount of liquidity. Capital spending for the first six months was about $360 million. We continue to expect capital spending for the year to be around $800 million, below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion. Slide 5 please. Other businesses were also higher versus the second quarter of 2019, driven by improvements in underwriting results from our captive insurance operations. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $194 million were higher year-over-year due to a larger delta in variable performance-related compensation expense accruals and transfer of costs from business segments into corporate as we centralize certain activities into our centers of excellences. Other charges declined due to improved foreign currency hedging results on intercompany funding and improved investment performance. Corporate results also included debt extinguishment expenses of $14 million related to an early retirement of a bond. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased due to lower average foreign costs related primarily to liability management actions taken in late 2019. Looking forward, we expect unallocated corporate expenses to be in line with our initial $800 million guidance for the calendar year and net interest expense to end similar to or slightly lower than the 2019 amount of about $350 million. Other business results in the second half of the year are expected to be significantly lower than the first half and likely negative based on expected insurance claims settlements and lower interest income in ADM investor services. Please turn to slide 6. Ag Services & Oilseeds delivered higher results versus the second quarter of 2019. Ag Services results were substantially better year-over-year. Strong execution by the team in South America helped deliver record quarterly origination and export volumes in a significantly improved margin environment, driven by a weaker Brazilian real and strong farmer selling. Global trade delivered best second quarter ever, continuing to demonstrate the importance of our strategic efforts to create value throughout the global supply chain. Destination marketing was a significant contributor as countries look to secure stable supplies of food amid the pandemic. Lower inferior grain margins impacted results in North America. Crushing results were lower year-over-year. The team delivered strong global crush volumes overall, and did a great job capitalizing on solid South American meal demand and weaker Brazilian real, along with a lack of Argentinian imports into EMEAI. In North America, margins were impacted by the pandemic's effects on our customers. Net timing impacts to the quarter were not significant as board crush gains were offset by basis losses and our cash flow hedge program deferred additional positive timing impacts. Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year, driven by improved biodiesel volumes and margins in North and South America, as well as strong volumes in margins in refined and packaged oils in South America. Demand was lower for biodiesel in EMEAI and for edible oils \u2013 for food service in both EMEAI and North America. Wilmar results were lower year-over-year. Wilmar's core earnings were strong, but reported earnings were impacted by mark-to-market losses on their investment portfolio in their first quarter. Fundamental global demand trends continue to emphasize the underlying strength and resilience of this industry and our business model. Looking ahead, we expect the pace of Brazilian farmer selling to slow significantly following the aggressive selling in the first half of the year. North American origination should strengthen throughout the second half as we move into the US harvest, and export demand is supported by China's import needs. Global crush margins are likely to remain pressured in the near term, but we expect tight soybean supplies in South America to lead to an improving margin environment as we move through the second half of the year. RPO should continue with solid performance. All told, we currently believe the third quarter will be sequentially lower than the second quarter of this year, followed by a much stronger fourth quarter. Slide 7 please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were similar to the year-ago quarter. Starches and sweetener results were lower year-over-year. COVID-19 related impacts on foodservice demand in North America pressured sweetener volumes. Mark-to-market losses on corn oil contracts indexed to soybean oil also impacted results, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. These impacts were partially offset by lower net raw material costs and positive risk management results. We also continue to benefit from the improvements we made in our Decatur corn complex and the continued turnaround in EMEAI. Wheat milling had another strong quarter as increased levels of home baking in store sales helped drive solid retail demand and footprint optimization initiatives, which reduced costs, continued to drive results. Vantage corn processor results were higher than the second quarter of 2019, driven by favorable risk management results on inventory positions and strong demand for high quality USP grade ethanol used for the hand sanitizer market. While average industry ethanol margins were down versus the prior year, prices and margins improved throughout the quarter as lower production including the two dry mills that we idled and some recovery in driving miles led to falling industry ethanol stocks. Looking ahead, we expect the third quarter results for Carbohydrate Solutions to be similar to the second quarter assuming sweetener demand continues to recover, demand in wheat milling remains solid and average industry ethanol margins over the quarter remain in positive territory. On slide 8, our Nutrition business continued to deliver significant growth, with 35% year-over-year profit improvement for the quarter. Over the first half of the year, adjusted profit for Nutrition is up more than 50%. And despite some COVID-19 impacts, revenue is up about 8% on a constant currency basis, with growth spread across the entire broad portfolio. Human nutrition results were substantially higher in the second quarter of 2020 versus the second quarter of 2019. Flavors continued to deliver solid results as favorable sales mix and margin expansion in North America was offset by some softness in EMEAI. In specialty ingredients, our team's strong execution and operational excellence, including at our soy protein facility in Campo Grande and our pea protein plant in Enderlin enable us to continue to meet rising consumer demand for plant-based proteins and edible beans, driving substantial year-over-year growth. Health and wellness delivered higher performance on strong sales for probiotics, improved volumes and margins in fiber, and additional fermentation income. Animal nutrition results were again higher year-over-year. Despite impacts from COVID-19 on demand in some regions, continued execution on Neovia synergies, robust demand for pet food and treats, and improvement in amino acids drove our ongoing profit growth. The investments we've made in Nutrition and our unique value proposition have positioned us well to support our customers as they continue to innovate and adapt in the current environment. We are winning new business and our pipeline today is strong and growing. We've also equipped our teams with new digital tools and technologies to continue product development work in a virtual environment, ensuring that products advance even in the current dynamic climate. Looking ahead, Nutrition should be around 20% higher in the back half of the year, compared to the second half of 2019, with similar rates of growth in profits in third and fourth quarters. We expect strength in flavors, plant-based proteins, and probiotics continue to drive human nutrition and Neovia synergies and improvements in amino acids to support animal nutrition results. Now, please turn to slide 9. And I'll turn it over back to Juan. Juan? Yes, Heather. It's Ray here. Yeah, for Vantage Corn Processor, remember, for VCP, not only are they producing the ethanol from the dry mills, but they're also the distributor of the ethanol that comes out of the wet mills. So, over the course of the quarter, we actually \u2013 as we indicate, we had a very, very good risk management on our inventory positions. Now, we knew coming into the quarter that the fact that we're going to cut back on ethanol production, shut down or idle the two dry mills, we had a pretty good sense of margins should improve throughout the quarter. So, the inventories that VCP had, as we went through the quarter, which includes the wet mill ethanol, we basically more or less left that unhedged, whereas we actually did hedge the corn position at a very, very low cost. And so, we benefit from stable risk management in terms of both the input side, meaning the raw corn, and the output side, which is the ethanol within the distribution system. And so, therefore, we had very, very good risk management results based on our inventory decision. So, that was an important driver. But don't underestimate the industrial ethanol business. We actually increased the capacity of our Peoria plant. It was like 85 million gallons entering the year and we were able to debottleneck many aspects of the plant and actually get that thing closer to 100 million gallons on an annual run rate basis. And we ran the plant full well over the quarter. And as you would appreciate, industrial ethanol margins improved also throughout the quarter. So, VCP also benefited from a very stable environment in terms of the aspects of the industrial ethanol business. And then lastly, again, as we indicated, we idled the plant. We did a pretty good job in terms of reducing the amount of stranded costs associated with those dry mills. And that also contributed towards our overall results. So, overall, it was actually, from our perspective, a good quarter for VCP in terms of how we manage the situation. You're referring to Carb Solutions in general for the quarter? Yeah. You look at starches and sweeteners, the other big sub segment here. We had good results. Naturally, for this segment, as Juan talked about earlier, the trough in terms of demand for sweeteners probably was the second quarter. It was probably in April/May timeframe. And so, therefore, we did experience reductions in volumes on the basis of corn sweeteners during that period. But what was interesting is when you look at starch and sweeteners, there were clearly strengths there as well. Number one, for example, wheat milling. Demand for flour continued to be strong in the second quarter. In fact, when we look at our global wheat milling results, our profits in the second quarter were up 50% versus the prior year. So, that was a big contributor towards the starch and sweetener results. Secondly, I did outline in my remarks that we did have mark-to-market losses on our corn oil contracts, just like we had in the first quarter. The fact I didn't highlight a number indicates that the number was actually much smaller than what we had in the first quarter. But we were also able to offset that impact with good risk management from the wet mills there as well. On a net basis, that was really a neutral impact. And then thirdly, it is important to also highlight in starches and sweeteners, the turnaround efforts, the improve efforts that we launched last year in the Decatur corn complex in the European business. They're truly paying off this year and also in the second quarter. So, they're all positive deltas that help neutralize some of the negative effects that we saw in terms of starches and sweetener volumes in the second quarter. And then, I already talked about VCP, which, again, stable risk management on inventory position. So, overall, I would have to say that, yes, it was actually a very strong quarter for starches and sweeteners in the second quarter compared to even what our initial expectations were as we entered into the quarter. But I have to give the team a lot of credit in terms of the efforts that they executed in order to help deliver the results here. Yes, Tom. Recall, the objective of our hedging program is really to manage margin risks on our products and to dampen volatility of earnings and cash flow. And we'll call any impact when it's greater than $50 million. That's what we've done in the past. So, we entered the second quarter with about $80 million of favorable timing effects that would be recognized in the future. And then, as you see in the supplementary data, we exit second quarter with about $95 million of favorable timing effect. So, on net, we had actually $15 million of unfavorable timing effects in the second quarter. Now, with board crush falling dramatically in the second quarter, we naturally did have hedge gains on crush. Now, some were deferred due to our cash flow hedge program, which we put in place several years ago, right? And so, although for these gains, they are basically under our cash flow hedge accounting, you don't have to mark-to-market. They're just simply deferred in the future and we'll recognize that. But we did also recognize some timing effects related to basis movements on oil, meal and beans, right? So, therefore, the favorable effect on board crush was offset by some of the unfavorable timing effects on basis movements. And as a result, we had a slight negative impact of $15 million. And again, we didn't call it out in our prepared remarks, but you can actually see that in the data there. The other thing to just note also, we also had some bunker fuel hedges and we call that out in the first quarter, right? Some unfavorable effects on bunker fuel hedges that should reverse out in the second quarter. And we did. We did have some favorable reversals. But, again, nothing significant in terms of size, and that's the reason why we didn't call it out. But in general, I'd have to say, our cash flow hedge program is actually something that helps smooth out some of the fluctuations that we have on our hedging. And then, there's also some other impacts that actually impact the net amount. But again, I think the key is that we saw about $95 million of favorable timing effects that will reverse out over the future quarters. Yeah, we did indicate that when we temporarily idled the two facilities. We said that we'll probably keep it down for about four months, which will, frankly, bring us to the end of the third quarter. I think the data that we're going to look at includes things such as industry ethanol levels, and it's actually very encouraging what we've seen recently where EIA data on ethanol and industry stocks, inventory level, they've come down from the peak of 27 million barrels down to about 20 million barrels right now. So, that's actually very, very encouraging. And you have seen ethanol margins respond accordingly with that particular reduction in terms of inventory. The other key variable is just the recovery of driving miles. And you're actually starting to see that. We were down as much as 40% during the trough of the shelter-in-place in terms of gasoline demand. We're starting to see some level of recovery. We're probably down as an industry about 15% right now. And so, I think that some of the key data that we're going to look at is how that recovery continues, how the inventory levels get maintained as we go through the next several months and how the margin environment evolves, and that will guide us also in terms of the appropriate timing to kind of restart both dry mills here. So, it is a dynamic \u2013 it's a dynamic situation, but we're going to be very data driven as we look towards the strategy here. Normally, in terms of crush, we normally kind of hedge the fourth quarter significantly, not 100%. But, normally, we're hedged, I think, 50%, 75%. Normally. We're always opportunistic, by the way too. We'll look at the levels and we'll determine when we layer in the levels. And then, as you go out into the future quarters, there's less. But we also do have hedges already in 2021 based upon the stable levels that we saw earlier in the year. The review is continuing. We have interested parties in the assets. Naturally, in the COVID-19 environment when the dry mills are shut down, the credit markets are basically shut down, we've taken a little bit of a pause. But, clearly, we expect the process to recommence as we kind of move through the back part of the year, as the markets start recovering back to more of a normality. Thank you. Amy, any more questions? Amy? Thank you, Ben. The demand for flour continues to be strong. Probably, first quarter, we saw a little bit of a surge because of pantry loading. But the demand effects continue to be solid for wheat, and hence our mills are actually running very, very hard. Now, the other big contributor, don't forget, is just the optimization initiatives that we had in our wheat processing plants. So, we actually shut down some inefficient mills and opened up new mills. The timing cannot be more perfect for that, right? Because the demand is there for our products. And now, we actually produce the flour from very efficient operations. And that has been actually an important contributor towards our overall improvement in terms of results for wheat milling. So, we're actually very, very pleased in terms of how this strategy has unfolded here. Hello, Amy? Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Victoria de la Huerga, Vice President, Investor Relations for Archer Daniels Midland Company. Ms. De la Huerga, you may begin.\nVictoria de la Huerga: Thank you, Jack. Good morning and welcome to ADM\u2019s first quarter earnings webcast. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's webcast will be available at adm.com.  For those following the presentation, please turn to Slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments and materials constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. On today's webcast, our Chairman and CEO, Juan Luciano, will provide an overview ADM\u2019s actions and operations in the current situation, our plans for the future and our view of market conditions. Our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Young, will review financial highlights and corporate results, as well as the drivers of our performance. Juan will then share some closing comments. Afterwards they'll take your question. Please turn to Slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Victoria. Thank you to everyone who is joining us. I hope everyone listening is staying safe and healthy. These are obviously extraordinary times, so I would like to take a little time today to share with you my thoughts on three important topics. First, how ADM is working to protect our teams and how we\u2019re continuing to provide nutrition to the world. Second, how we are thinking about our strategy and long-term plans in this unique times. And third, some views of the near and medium term demand environment and market conditions. Let me start by offering my thanks to our global team and partners. Across more than 800 facilities and thousands of transportation assets around the globe, ADM colleagues in the first quarter not only maintained our operations, but in some areas set production records. These men and women are supporting the global food supply chain and because of them millions, even billions of people who don't know ADM can eat every day. We are grateful for that commitment. Thousands of other colleagues have been enabled by our IT team to work remotely and are showing their flexibility and ingenuity to keep the rest of our business running smoothly. Just a month ago, we were having discussions about whether we would be able to have this earnings call on our normal quarterly schedule, or whether we should delay a week or more. Thanks to our global business services, IT and financial teams, we closed our Q1 books and we are ready to have this call with you today. Take this across 38,000 colleagues and you can see why, as of today, AVM is continuing to fulfill our purpose by providing nutrition around the globe without any significant operational interruptions due to COVID-19 outbreaks. I am honored and grateful to be part of this great team. And I hope all of our ADM colleagues who are listening on this call are proud of their achievements as well. Our leadership team is doing everything we can to support our colleagues. Circumstances changed fast, so every morning since early February, our cross functional leadership team has met to review the global situation, evaluate new risks, and make timely decisions to protect our teams and our business. We put in place strict guidelines to protect our employees and contractors from enacting travel restrictions early in the year, to a critical focus on enabling social distances in our production facilities, to ongoing remote work. When colleagues do develop symptoms, we have protocols designed to protect them and others who might have come in contact with them, as well as support continuity of operations. This includes paid leave for all colleagues during required quarantine periods where necessary to support them and their families. So far, only a relatively small number of ADM colleagues have tested positive. Tragically, we did suffer our first COVID-related fatality two weeks ago. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been personally impacted by this disease. Our ADM colleague emergency fund is available for team members who are facing economic hardship due to the crisis. And through ADM Cares we have committed funds and other resources to support others in communities around the world who are serving on the front lines in the fight against COVID-19. We also made some early decisions in order to strengthen ADM\u2019s position during what was sure to be a challenging operational and economic environment. For example, our balance sheet has historically been a source of strength for ADM. And in March, we further enhanced our cash position and reduced our exposure to short term credit market risks by issuing $1.5 billion in term debt. We are taking other actions, including reducing capital spending to reflect practical limitations in these environments \u2013 in this environment, while still completing projects necessary to maintain our facilities in same hot productive order and advanced critical strategic projects. Our team is delivering. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.64. Adjusted segment operating profit was $643 million. And our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 7.6%. Our performance is a testament to our team's ability to fulfill our critical role in the global food supply chain and deliver results to our shareholders, despite incredibly challenging circumstances. Please turn to Slide 4. As you can see even amid these global challenges, we're also continuing our work to ensure ADM remains strong and vital in the years to come. We are not slowing down in our commitment to delivering our strategy, nor in our focus on the business drivers under our control and our actions to improve the company. I am proud that even as our team was keeping our operations running under difficult circumstances, they also made great progress advancing the strategic imperatives we've defined this year, with accomplishments like improving capital efficiency in Ag Services & Oilseeds, advancing our center of expertise structure with the new global supply chain organization and delivering on our Neovia synergies more than two years ahead of our target. And we continue to advance readiness, which since the program began, has unlocked $920 million in run-rate benefits on an annual basis. All told, thanks to our team's great work we have achieved about 30% of our $500 million to $600 million in targeted improvements for 2020 and we continue to feel good about reaching our goal by the end of the year. We are also ensuring we live up to our critical role as steel were not just of our company, but of the natural resources that are vital to our business and our future. In 2011, we announced our \u201c15x20\u201d plan in which we committed to per unit improvements in energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, water waste to landfill by 2020. We met each of those goals ahead of schedule and this year we were proud to unveil even more ambitious commitments to reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% and our energy intensity by 15% in the next 15 years. Finally, I would like to talk a little bit about our world view of the markets and our future. With major western economies shut down. We are encouraged by the actions many nations are taking to contain the spread of COVID-19 and enabled an eventual recovery. How that recovery unfolds where and at what pace is something we'll be monitoring very carefully. And while precise predictions of these points are difficult, there are a few ways we can categorize some of the market impacts we're seeing. We saw short term acceleration in demand for certain products, such a flower, or stapled packaged goods that we provide flavors and ingredients for as consumers loaded their pantries in advance to stay-at-home orders. Many of these products have reached or will reach saturation point and we expect demand to normalize. Then there are products that have been impacted as a direct result of the various national and local stay-at-home orders. For ADM, that includes refined oils, or food service, as well as biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel. As you know, we've made the difficult decision last week to idle two of our dry mills amid continued low gasoline demand. We would expect to see some of these demand build back in as economies reopen, though there will be a significant variability depending on when and how those re-openings occur. We\u2019re also seeing volatility in margin environments for certain commodity products, as markets constantly reevaluate global supply and demand balances due to a variety of factors. One key element we\u2019re following closely here is the Phase 1 trade agreement with China. We've seen good buying of U.S. agricultural products by China so far this year, which could bode well for future purchases in the back half of the year. Equally as importantly, our global footprint gives us continued confidence in our ability to support global trade flows of food and agricultural products. Then there are the changing behaviors which might have longer term impacts. For example, in the food market we are seeing a back-to-basics approach, desire for comfort foods, snacks and staple goods, while consumers are staying home. We're seeing consumers increasing their purchases online, which impacts the demand for industrial starches used to make cardboard. And we are seeing an increase in interest in products that support health and wellness. There are many unknowns. What we do know, however, is that the transformation that ADM has undertaken over the last several years is now helping ensure that we're well equipped to pivot to whatever our customers require and whatever the world needs. We built up our product portfolio, our footprint, our innovation and our agility. And we are planning for the future. For example, we thought about the potential for changes in how we all interact with each other, our team launched virtual innovation sessions with customers in order to ensure we can continue to meet their needs. We aren't immune from some of the negative effects of the pandemic and its economic fallout. But we're confident in the ability of our great team to continue to provide nutrition around the globe. Now Ray will take us through our business performance before I come back to offer some final comments, before we go to Q&A. Ray, please.\nRay Young: Thanks, Juan. Good day everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. I like to start by echoing Jyan\u2019s thanks to our ADM colleagues around the globe. We are fortunate to have this team and very grateful for their dedication. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up from the $0.46 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $643 million. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.6%, higher than our 2020 WACC of 5.75%. In our trailing four-quarter average adjusted EBITDA was about $3.5 billion. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was approximately a positive 4% compared to an expense of 26% in the prior year. The favorable current quarter rate was due primarily to the impact of U.S. tax credits signed into law in December including railway maintenance tax credits. The tax credits primarily benefit our business partners and are substantially passed on to them through the prices of goods and services we negotiate to support their respective businesses. That maintenance expense is reflected in the cost of goods sold line of our GAAP statements and then the other charges line in the management statements. Looking ahead, we\u2019re now expecting effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15% before any discrete tax items. We generated about $800 million of cash from operations before working capital for the year, higher than 2019. Return of capital for the full year was about $315 million including about $110 million in opportunistic share repurchases that will offset dilution for the year. We finished the quarter with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 29%, down from the 32% a year ago. Capital spending for the quarter was about $200 million. As Juan said in view of a more challenging environment to execute capital projects, for example, due to social distancing consideration, we're reducing our capital spending plans. We expect spending for the year to be closer to $800 million, down from our initial guidance. We'll continue to advance projects and invest in maintenance necessary to run our operations safely and effectively, of course, but some discretionary projects will be put on hold. Next slide please. Over the past several years, we have been diversifying our sources of funding particularly working capital funding so as not to be relying on any one source. These new sources of funding include Euro CP facilities, U.S. and International receivable securitization facilities, and the structured trade financing facilities. In March, we added to this diversification by putting in place a U.S. inventory financing facility. As it became apparent that the COVID-19 situation could disrupt capital markets, we put in place additional global credit facilities as well as issued $1.5 billion of term debt in order to minimize rollover risk of our commercial paper program. The term debt was rated solid single A. In addition, we have been approved for the Federal Reserve\u2019s commercial paper funding facility, which would serve as an additional backstop to our U.S. commercial paper facility. As a result, at the end of March we had cash and marketable securities of $4.7 billion and available untapped global credit facilities of $5.9 billion. The $4.7 billion of cash is much higher than the normal $1 billion that we would normally carry. As a precaution due to dislocations in the short-term credit markets we saw in the month of March. In future quarter ends, you should expect us to carry significantly lower cash balances as we now have the other liquidity facilities in place. We also had $5.6 billion of readily marketable inventories, which if needed we could sell very quickly and turn into cash. When taken together, we feel confident that we will be able to comfortably weather any prolonged downside economic scenarios and continue funding all of our financial and capital spending obligations including dividends in the foreseeable future. Please turn to Slide 7. Other business results were slightly down year-over-year. Futures commission loss provisions were partially offset by improvements in captive insurance operations. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $189 million were slightly higher year-over-year principally due to the continued investments in IT and business transformation. Other charges increased due to the railroad maintenance expenses that I referred to earlier that we funded on behalf of U.S. short line railroads and which had an offsetting credit and tax expense, partially offset by improved foreign hedging results on intercompany funding. Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than last year, benefiting from lower average borrowing costs from liability management actions taken in late 2019. Effective January 1st, we decided to discontinue LIFO inventory valuation method accounting. And the corporate results include a LIFO credit of $91 million or $0.12 per share due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve balance. Please turn to slide 8. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team did a great job to deliver strong results. Ag Services results more than doubled versus the first quarter of 2019, which was negatively impacted by high water conditions in North America. Excellent performances in destination marketing and structured trade finance drove extremely strong results in global trade. Robust farmer selling in Brazil drove higher year-over-year origination volumes and margins, which were partially offset by weaker results in North America. Crushing results were lower than the prior-year-period. The team delivered high overall crushed volumes including a Q1 record for soy crush. Execution margins were solid, though below the high realized margins in the first quarter of 2019, which benefited from the short crop in Argentina. The prior-year quarter also benefited from about $75 million of positive timing impacts. Refined Products and other results were higher than the first quarter of 2019. Higher margins in both biodiesel and refined oils in North America were offset by lower biodiesel margins in EMEA. Peanut shelling results were significantly improved versus the prior-year period; as our improvement actions continued to strengthen that business. Wilmar results were significantly higher year-over-year due to stronger performances in tropicals and oilseeds and grain. Slide 9 please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were lower than the first quarter of 2019. As a reminder starting this quarter, we are reporting different subsegments within this business. The new Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including wet mill ethanol results, was down year-over-year, largely due to about $50 million in negative mark-to-market impacts on forward sales of corn oil, much of which could reverse over the balance of the year. Absent those impacts, results were higher due to improved manufacturing costs driven impart by improvements made at the Decatur complex last year. Strong results in wheat milling as customers fill pantries and improved performance and conditions in EMEA including stronger demand and lower input costs. Vantage Corn Processors or VCP which includes our dry mill ethanol results was slightly higher versus the prior year. Effective risk management, combined with the lack of severe weather impacts seen in the first quarter of 2019, helped offset weak industry ethanol margins caused by significantly decreased demand. To bring the transition \u2013 to bridge the transition this quarter under the prior segmentation of Carbohydrate Solutions, the old Starches and Sweeteners would have reported above $160 million of operating profit. And the bio products segments would have reported about negative $92 million of losses, including the $50 million of negative mark-to-market impacts, which would have been split roughly equally between the two sub-segments. We have also included a pro former 2019 restatement of Carbohydrate Solutions in the appendix to this presentation. Slide 10 please. Nutrition continued its growth trajectory with record results. Our Human Nutrition businesses formerly known as WFSI delivered strong performance and growth across the broad portfolio including flavors, especially ingredients and health and wellness. Increased sales revenue in North America and EMEA flavors, continued sales growth in alternative proteins, and additional bioactives income helped drive improved results. As Juan mentioned earlier, we did see higher demand in some human nutrition areas as a result of new wins as well as some pantry loading effects. Animal Nutrition improved year-over-year results were driven by a strong performance from Neovia, good volumes and margins in feed additives, and solid sales in pet care. The prior year quarter also had been negatively impacted by about $10 million in upfront purchase price adjustments related to Neovia. Amino acids were negatively impacted by a year-over-year decline in the global pricing environment though prices were directly improved over Q4 of 2019 we are also very pleased that we met our Neovia synergy targets more than two years early. Our forward look includes some uncertainty as the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continue to reverberate through the global economy. Despite this uncertainty as Juan indicated earlier, we remain focused on the drivers under our control and we're on track to deliver to that target range of controllable benefits this year. Now turning to the second quarter directionally. First, Ag Services and Oilseeds we expect segment results to be lower than Q1 subject to mark-to-market impacts as Ag Services seasonally normalizes, crush margins have come off to highs and the RPO business has some headwinds on near-term demand. In Carbohydrate Solutions, we expect the second quarter to be slightly better than Q1 of this year, but much lower than the year ago quarter, as ethanol industry demand and margins continue to be a negative driver and food service demand negatively impacts negatively impacts Starches and Sweeteners. For nutrition, we feel confident that the business will continue to advance to another calendar year of 20% plus growth. Now please turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ray. I spoke a lot at the beginning of the call, so I'll just close by saying this. The core of our existence is the belief that food is fundamental. It sustains us, fulfills us and fuels our well being. Today, our role in providing for that need is more critical than ever. All of our teams are putting safety first as they support the global food supply chain. We're meeting needs that have changed dramatically in just the last few months and we'll be there to continue to provide nutrition to the world as we emerged from this challenge, I've never been prouder to be part of this team and this company, and I never been more confident about our ability to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. With that, Jack, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Your line is open.\nBen Bienvenu: Yes. Thanks, good morning everybody.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ben.\nRay Young: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to ask a question. I'll start with crushing. I appreciate the color that you all gave. Two part question. One, if you could quantify what the mark-to-market impact was for the quarter? And then two, when we look at the data relative to what we can track, the results in the quarter were quite a bit lower than we would have expected. And I'm wondering perhaps there's something we can't track whether its basis or some sort of utilization dynamic and in the facilities that limited your ability to generate a little bit higher crushed margins. Any color that you can provide to elaborate on what's happening there would be helpful?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Let me start, Ben and I then Ray can touch on the mark-to-market. So I think what happened \u2013 what you see in the first quarter is that the bean market was supported basically by Chinese buying simply by \u2013 while the mill value is impacted by demand issues. So you see a cash margins in beans that they tend to track board crash. But this quarter, the impact of soybean bases, as the ability of the farmer to hold the beans increase, impacted our margins. So margins are down year-to-year by about $15 per ton. So I think that that's quite explains the situation. Of course we have expectations that the overall temporary adjustment of the shift in demand will subside as some of this \u2013 some of our customers manage this adjustment. But I think in North America that was the biggest impact, if you will. Soybean, crush soybean base is high and mill values being a little bit soft due to lack of demand in food service. With regards to the mark-to-market, I think Ray can provide some more granularity on that.\nRay Young: Yes. On the mark-to-market impact as I indicated, last year if you recall we had some very stable mark-to-market impacts about $75 million. This quarter we didn't \u2013 I didn't highlight anything on the call because it was not material, but if you recall, like we entered the quarter with a fairly large balance in terms of deferred gains. But what happened, as you know, is the board crush actually went up during the course of March, right? And so therefore we actually had mark-to-market losses there. And so when you actually take into account of the deferred gains coming into the quarter, and then the mark-to-market \u2013 the new mark-to-market losses that we took as board crush went up, they netted out to be fairly immaterial. I mean, it's just really not meaningful in terms of the overall results there. I do want to remind you, it's actually in your supplemental information that at the end of the first quarter we still have about $80 million of deferred gains that will be recognized as we kind of move through the rest of the year there. So hopefully that will help you in terms of understanding where the mark-to-market currently stands.\nBen Bienvenu: It does. Thank you. My second question is related to the Starches and Sweeteners business. Appreciate the bridge back to apples-to-apples result, and appreciate the 2Q commentary. I'm curious when you think about the COVID operating environment, the stronger demand for container board, stronger demand for the packaged foods consumption netted against weaker demand for food service. Do you think this environment is net positive or negative for Starches and Sweeteners and then the big move down that we've seen in that corn costs, while I realize you all hedged a significant component of your cost there? How impactful is that to the business?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I will say as we look at the demand for Starches and Sweeteners, Ben, we see that that the demand was strong for us at least in January and February. So I think that we saw some decline in demand in March, but not that significant. We see \u2013 we saw more significant demand decline in April. Over the last two weeks, I'm talking about mostly Sweeteners and Starches. Over the last two weeks we have seen orders pick-up bunk a little bit again, so maybe there is a little bit more energy in the food service markets around the world right now. So I would say a demand of Sweeteners and Starches we're going to see a bigger impact in second quarter that maybe we saw in the first quarter. Of course the second quarter we have less of a mark-to-market corn oil issues and we will continue to enjoy some of the improvements. The operational improvements were strong. The improvement on European operations were strong and milling had a very good quarter, and we're going to have some as you said, lower net corn cost of all that. So \u2013 but when you take all the puts and takes with a slower demand, we probably see a slight improvement versus Q1 into Q2 but not a significant one.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Thanks. Good luck.\nRay Young: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. There's increased consumption of food at home. Is it your \u2013 your message here is that that only partially offsets the decline from consumption of food away from home. And I guess that flows through vegetable oils, Starches and Sweeteners. Maybe can talk a little bit about the impact on animal care also? Maybe there was a pull forward in the first quarter. But is that the big food consumption message that you have here?\nJuan Luciano: Rob, I think that it depends on the business and our exposure to food service versus retail. So if you go to the milling business; the milling business had a very good first quarter and we had a good demand everywhere in the world. If you see the nutrition business, I have less exposure to food service was a very strong quarter and that continues to grow. So I would say, they all said depends on your mix. When we go to things like, for example, the corn oil \u2013 corn oil goes more to retail. So we saw better demand for, for things like chips. On the other hand, soybean oil goes to more to foodservice. So we see a little bit of weakness there. When we're talking about food service we think though that probably we saw the trust in late, late April, maybe the orders at the \u2013 for the beginning for May and we started to see over the last two weeks, things becoming a little bit better. So I think we are a little bit more optimistic as some of the economies start to reopen. We start to see that. We have the benefit of being a global company. We see that pandemic have all been from East to West. So we\u2019re seeing already food services in Asia getting back to maybe 70% to 80% of where they used to be. Of course much more on food deliveries and takeouts and things like that than actually in-room dining. But we see a little bit of that come back. So again, I think you should think about for ADM the impact has been more in food services North America, in terms oil because even package oils in Europe and South America, since South America and Europe has less impact to food service. We have been a little bit more robust on the last point of your question or regarding animal nutrition. How would animal nutrition with the acquisition of Neovia has become very global and very much diversified into many, many applications and business subsections. So we saw strength on that and we expect a lot of that strength to continue. North America has been more impacted and yes, we\u2019re going to see some of that reduction in feed in North America, probably in the second quarter more immediately than in the West.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And then a follow-up if I could. There's been a lot of news flow about liquidations in U.S. livestock. It sounds like a temporary thing. But at what point does that become a risk to domestic soy meal demand here in the U.S.? Do you have any outlook on that?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Of course, that, I mean, it's unfortunate all this impact that COVID has been having in so many people and so many industries. And when we look at the demand for soybean meal, with everything that's happened, of course, it's going to be lower than we have anticipated before. But I think you need to think about this as a temporary adjustment. Most of our customers are shifting as quickly as possible from foodservice to retail. That's probably is going to be \u2013 there is still a strong demand in the retail area. And we started to see much more the increase of China imports from the United States in terms of pork and poultry, and that will help medium-term also to exacerbate the demand for soybean meal. So medium term, we are constructive. I think in the short term, we need to go through this volatility of customers shifting their patterns. And we will have to go through that probably in Q2.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome Rob.\nOperator: Ben Kallo with Baird. Your line is open.\nBen Kallo: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So I\u2019ve two questions. Just one, kind of going back to the last time you talked after the Q4 results. Could you just talk about maybe just generally how you view the market going forward and your level of visibility, if you're better or worse, then? And then can you just talk about the Nutrition business? Because I think it gets lost kind of in all the other parts of the business, and you made significant improvements there. Just \u2013 I know you said that there's \u2013 the growth will continue next year. But can you just talk more in-depth about how we should think about margin expansion and then the different trends that are driving that business? Because I know you've put a lot of investment into it. And so I think that maybe just reminding us how we should think about that business, especially in this uncharted territory, about how that holds up? And I know there's a lot there, but thank you.\nJuan Luciano: No, that\u2019s all right. Thank you, Ben. So let me start with COVID and how I see the world now versus how I saw it the last time we spoke. First of all, I'm proud and also a little bit surprised how well we managed to keep the operations going through all this. If you have told me that we will be running more than 800 plants around the world with minimum staffing, with people in quarantine and running the rest of the company remotely, I mean, I think it's testament of the resilience of the ADM people and business model. So very proud of that. Second, I think fundamentally, we remain very confident because, first of all, we hit the ground running this year and almost ahead of schedule in most of our improvements. Remember, we call for $500 million to $600 million of self-help here. And as I said in my remarks, we are through 25% of the year, we're probably 30% accomplished there. So I'm happy with that. I'm happy with we are executing in Neovia. We achieved synergies three years ahead of schedule. So the team is clicking on all the boxes that we promised to shareholders and to the Board that we were going to do. In terms of demand, I'm normally a little bit more relaxed because we are in the food industry. We are blessed with that, and there is the same number of mouths out there eating. So our role of it in the world continues to be as important as before. We need to go through this shift and this shift benefits some businesses and creates short-term disruptions in some other business, but the fundamental impact of COVID in the first quarter was to the carbohydrate solution business in terms of death and all. There was some biodiesel, but biodiesel North America navigated it better. South America and Europe was a little bit more impacted in terms of biodiesel. But I will say the big impact was scarf solution in ethanol. And that is something that \u2013 it was a very big impact because we were coming already in a situation of high inventories and the industry has negative margins already by the time we get into that. And \u2013 but you see us again focusing on why we can control them, so what we did in crush, for example, we have adjusted crush margins in North America, crush rates in \u2013 operating rates in North America to offset the little bit \u2013 the short term issue on demand that we\u2019re having. And we took the difficult decision of take two of the dry mills down in North America. So, I see fundamentally the demand being solid for us. Margins are still good margins. And I still see all the things that the business has been under management team has been focused on hitting in all cylinders and going a little bit ahead of schedule as of Neovia, or the $500 million to $600 million and the readiness efforts. When talking about nutrition, I said to all of our investors over the last year and a half that they been supporting us through all the investment phase in nutrition and nutrition have not been showing that in the P&L because this was organic growth and we have some \u2013 some growing pains into some of these assets as you build them and you have to finance them. But when you see now what's starting to happen is what we predicted before is all those wins, all that innovation, we always said we have our value proposition is resonating with our customers. We had that. That line was a little bit masked by all these organic growth that was coming. Now all that organic growth is hitting the P&Ls because these investments are maturing. And you're going to see that and we grew 23% profits last year. We are growing \u2013 we are going to grow another north of 20% this year. You see WFSI during this. So take Neovia and animal nutrition out for a minute since the first quarter is a little bit of a strange comparison because we acquired this last first quarter. So but if you take WFSI, WFSI has grown earnings up 28% in the first quarter. So we continue a little bit rhythm of 23 that we deliver last year and flavors are growing at revenue at 7.8%. So, we feel pretty good about that business. It's a very diversified business. And if anything we experienced in COVID with people that come back from this pandemic like we've seen in Asia, is that people come back with a more \u2013 with an enhanced focus on health and then the importance of quality nutrition for their wellbeing. So we've seen the probiotics our health and wellness segment is up like 24% in terms of revenue because the sales of those products are \u2013 for humans has been probably reemphasized by all this COVID. So we think that we are in the right segments. We think we have the right product mix. So we feel very bullish about \u2013 continue this performance for the nutrition business.\nBen Kallo: And thank you. And I will speak one morning if I can to Ray just range on capital allocation. And \u2013 how are you looking at it just because I'm sure there are some distressed businesses out there that could fit into your portfolio. And so has that started to happen yet? Or is that you have bigger fish to fry? Or how do we think about that that fitting in just from an acquisition product? Thank you.\nRay Young: Yes. From a capital allocation perspective as you know this year we are focused on further deleveraging the balance sheet to get towards our low twos target range in terms of debt to EBITDA. At the same time as you pointed out me there could be opportunities out there and we're always looking at opportunities out there. So, nothing, nothing clear right now, but I think we'll just keep an open \u2013 keep our ears and eyes open. But again, priority at least in the near term is to get our balance sheet into a little bit lower in terms of the leverage position.\nBen Kallo: Perfect. Thanks guys.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: Tom Simonitsch with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTom Simonitsch: Good morning.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Tom.\nTom Simonitsch: Say just given the fall in fuel demand, can you comment on the outlook for \u2013 by diesel demand and production relative to your earlier expectations for this year? And is there a potential for a double negative for ADM as you cut the U.S. production and forgo tax credits or those credits just embedded in the margin structure?\nJuan Luciano: I think on biodiesel demand what we're seeing, Tom, is in Europe we're actually seeing more of a hit in terms of our biodiesel demand. A part of it is just simply due to the fact that as in Europe, passenger cars actually use diesel a lot in addition to commercial vehicles. And so when you have to shelter-in-place orders come in for Europe, it really negatively impacted the demand environment over there. What's interesting in the United States, we actually have not seen that that drop-off. In fact in the early part of the quarter, we actually saw strong demand for diesel because as you know, trucks, the trucking industry were actually running very, very hard in order to keep the warehouses supplied. And as airlines kind of shut down, a lot of the goods actually start moving on the truck front. So, we've seen on the biodiesel front, which is tied to the really diesel demand that the United States actually has held up reasonably well. In terms of our block, our biodiesel block, we've got it. A lot of it already sold out into the second and third quarter. So we feel good about \u2013 this part of the business is actually holding up right now.\nTom Simonitsch: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a clarification on the railway tax credits, you noted that the cost of acquiring those tax credits reduced your pre-tax profit. Can you just confirm that all those associated costs are recognized in the same quarter as the tax benefit?\nRay Young: Yes, I can confirm that. Again, on a GAAP statement, it\u2019s in the cost of goods sold on the management statements you can look at the other charges line and that full amount \u2013 and if you look in the appendix, you can see all the information there, like the $73 million of tax credits is fully reflected in the other chargers line of the management statement there.\nTom Simonitsch: That's great. And just one last one for me. If you could maybe just give us some more color around the negative mark-to-market in corn oil. I don't think I've seen that before. So why are we seeing that this quarter?\nRay Young: Yes, you're right. I've never really talked about mark-to-market on corn oil before in prior earnings calls. And frankly, the last time we actually saw this was about 10 years ago. So, what happened was as ethanol plants slowed down around the country then as you know corn oil is a byproduct of ethanol production. And so, we actually saw a reduction in terms of supply of corn oil. At the same time as Juan indicated earlier, we actually saw a significant demand for fried snacks like chips. So actually demand for corn oil actually went up. And so, we actually start seeing a divergence between soybean oil prices and corn oil prices, which again, historically tracked very closely with one another. And so, as corn oil prices, and this really occurred \u2013 started occurring at the end of March, as corn oil prices moved up, we have a forward book of sales contracts in corn oil and some of those sales contracts are actually indexed to bean oil, right. And that's just because of history in terms of how \u2013 how these prices have correlated. So when we actually mark the book at the end of March for the forward sales contracts that were indexed to bean oil. We actually had to take a mark-to-market loss on that. Now I do expect, as I indicated in my comments that part of this mark-to-market impact it should reverse, it could reverse as we kind of move through the year, due to two factors. One, with higher corn oil price, that means the corn product credit will actually go up as we kind of move through the year, which means net corn costs compared to where we were at the beginning of the year of the should actually come down. And then secondly, as we move through the year as ethanol production actually starts ramping up due to gasoline demand of returning, and as the shelter-in-place orders come off and maybe chip them in and start to come back off a little bit, then you should actually start seeing the historical correlation start returning back again. So that's the reason why I feel that it's kind of move through the next 12 months. Probably in the back half of the year, I should expect about half of the negative mark-to-market to come back in the form of other lower net corn cost, or mark-to-market reversals. As Juan indicated, I think, for the second quarter I do probably expect that the negative mark-to-market to kind of \u2013 it's not going to be the same magnitude of $50 million, but we may have some slightly negative mark-to-market in the second quarter as well in Carb Solutions.\nTom Simonitsch: Thanks, Ray. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.\nKen Zaslow: Hey good morning everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning Ken.\nRay Young: Hey Ken.\nKen Zaslow: Just a couple of quick ones, on the vegetable oil side, are you still making favorable spreads or have they gone to a negative, is there any thoughts of maybe pulling back capacity or anything like that? How is that playing out?\nJuan Luciano: Well, as I said before, we have adjusted crush in North America a little bit. So we ran hard in the first quarter. And then at the end of March we adjusted crush into April a little bit. So we are monitoring all that. And as I said before, I think, that soybean oil mostly has been affected in the oil side in North America. It has been more biodiesel impact in the other places, but package oils has been more robust in the other two geographies in Europe and South America.\nKen Zaslow: And can you also take us around the world are the crush margins in Europe, China, Canada, holding up better than that of the U.S.? And if so, what do you attribute that to?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I think in Europe margins are $25 to $35 per ton, so a little bit better. And I think that a couple of things, Argentine crush is still not a major threat to Europe, maybe in six to eight weeks, when the product of all the harvest start hitting the shores of Europe maybe. And then I think that having the \u2013 meat is in very good demand in Europe for all the retail issue and the retail segment. And meat packers in Europe have smaller plants. So I think that they have fewer people in all the plants. So the issue of maybe COVID spreading among workers had been less of an issue there. The issue in Europe has been of course the biodiesel as Ray mentioned before, biodiesel is used more for passenger transportation in Europe, so that was absolutely shut down. And so we adjusted the rate to some of those plans. At the moment we are running as much soya crush as we can in Europe, of course, given our advantage there. Brazil margins are more in the $15 to $25 per ton. They are the big farmer selling. Demand for oil has been \u2013 for package oil has been good. And then biodiesel we've been able to move enough biodiesel there in Brazil, this is tied to economic activity. And less of a passenger drive, passenger car there. And we've been able to manage more of that. Demand for meat has I continued to be very strong. Most of our customers, they are exporting a lot of their meat to China. So that demand has been very strong. And other than one announcement of a plant with some issues in poultry a week ago all the plants of our customers have been running in Brazil. So far so good in Brazil. So I would say one of the big things that we noticed this quarter in terms of soybean oil has been the great benefits of having the global trade desk actually working together to facilitate that we continue to crush hard, because basically they took care of the oil, exporting that oil. And you see the one of the benefits of the combination between the Ag Services business and Oilseeds is it business is that the global trade works either to place a little bit more of North America mill into export markets or a lot of the oil into the export market so our plants can continue to run. That has been very beneficial to us.\nKen Zaslow: And then my last question is will we finally get a consolidation or a reduction of number of players in ethanol? Is this an event that could really change the structure of the ethanol industry? Or is it one of those you will see production cuts, everybody goes down and then it just kind of rebounds? How do you think about that? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes Ken, that's a good question. I think it depends on probably the duration of this situation. The industry is working at the lowest production rates ever. And I think that we saw more than 70 plants going down. And for somebody that have run plants before it depends on how long it takes for that plant to be down. After a few months, things start becoming complicated and maybe fewer of those plants will be able to come back. So it depends how quickly margins, rebound. But I would say if there is a prolonged activity or low gasoline prices and margins continue to be down for a while, I think, you will see some players not coming back, whether that's enough to restructure the industry is probably a tall order question there that I would not guess to answer at this point.\nKen Zaslow: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Heather Jones with Heather Research. Your line is open.\nHeather Jones: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I know we are running out of time, so I'll just do this quickly. Has your corporate expense outlook changed at all given the deterioration in the economic outlook?\nRay Young: No Heather, I know we were a little lower in the first quarter, but a lot of the initiatives that we announced in our fourth quarter call in terms of our business transformation \u2013 we have not slowed that down. In fact one argues that these business transformation initiatives are actually very, very important for the long term of ADM. And so we have not diverted from those particular, strategic initiatives there. So the guidance that we provided to you in the fourth quarter for the calendar years remains in place. I think the only thing that's changed in terms of below line is like interest expense. I think that with the addition of long-term debt that we put onto the balance sheet you should expect probably our net interest expense probably be similar to where we were last year.\nHeather Jones: Okay, thank you for that. And then Juan, you had mentioned that you guys moderated your crush rate coming into Q2. Lately I've been hearing multiple reports that bean oil storage in the U.S. has become constrained. And so just wondering if you could walk us through that? And how serious it is? And if so is further moderation going to be required?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I think, that during the first quarter we saw, I mean, as you see March when we saw the decline in economic activity around the world that became the limiting factor for crush, it was like, you know, do you have an outset? Do you have a house for soybean oil? As I said, we have been good at using our integration to make that soybean oil disappear and keep crush margins up. Of course the longer this takes inventories start to pop and not everybody have the same ability to place those things with us. And there is a lot of people fighting for liquid storage these days in North America. But I would say, I think, we are comfortable with the level of adjustment in production that we have at this point. We adjusted about five percentage points. And I think for now that that's good. So we don't foresee more at this point. And as I said before, Heather we started to see\u2026\nHeather Jones: Okay, [indiscernible].\nJuan Luciano: Yes I'm talking about ADM specifically, I wouldn't venture about what's going to happen for the rest of the industry. But as I said we have that benefit of that integration with the global trade. But I would say over the last week and two weeks as China started to reopen and as Europe prepares to reopen and then in some cases they have done, so we started to see a little bit more activity. And I don't know if people replenishing pipeline in preparation for the summer or what. But orders have popped up a little bit over the last two weeks in general for ADM.\nHeather Jones: That's great color. Thank you so much.\nJuan Luciano: You are welcome Heather.\nOperator: As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.\nVincent Andrews : Hi, thanks for taking my question after the hour and I'll keep it to one. Could you just remind us how the \u2013 what we used to call WFSI how that business did during the last recession or in economic slowdowns in general? I'm just thinking once we get past COVID there's really still going to be a recessionary environment for who knows how long but long enough. So any help there would be would be great.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Well, we didn't have WFSI on the last recession, so it's difficult to compare. But I think it's a good question in the sense that the business is relatively less exposed to food service than there may be other segments that we have in the company. And it's very, very diversified because the systems, and the flavors and the pantry is so broad that goes into almost every product, whether it's food or beverage. So I would say a pretty resistance in that point. I think that the thing that we are watching very careful is not that much the absolute demand, which we feel comfortable whether it maybe softer in previous scores than it was in Q1 may be there is some adjustment to pantry filling. But I think what we are seeing is our win rates, our ability to place new orders or bring new products have been strong. Our ability to provide existing sales of existing products to existing customers have been good. And I think that what we may see, because we saw that in Asia, it's a little bit of deceleration in innovations in food services in the first quarter because logically companies as they focus more on delivery or pickups or e-commerce, they tend to emphasize their traditional products. You are not going to go to a food service restaurant and order take out something new, you normally go to something that you know. So we've seen a little bit of decline and that started to come back slowly. But that probably will be the shift. The shift is maybe that we sell more of existing products than the proportion we used to sell off innovative products. So we think that the impact of the recession may be a little bit of a delay in the introduction of our new products.\nVincent Andrews : Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vince. \nOperator: Michael Piken with Cleveland Research, your line is open.\nMichael Piken: Yes, hi. I will also limit it to one question. If you could just talk a little bit about kind of what's happening down in Brazil with the port infrastructure and obviously a lot of talk about how they are managing COVID-19 a little differently. But how are your operations going down there? Are you seeing any port backups? And I know you got a slide on farmer selling being pretty good, but just the overall state of the Ag economy down in Brazil would be great.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I would say listen, the team identify of course very early on potentially ports could be a weak point in terms of the COVID issue. And we took all kinds of precautions to make sure that that was not the case, so it was not impacted. And I would say at this point in time, we have no issues in terms of being able to load. There may be a little bit of an extra cost here and there, but nothing, nothing material that we should worry about. In Argentina there has been a little bit of \u2013 even in the phase, to be honest, when I said we were preparing because we were preparing for the big export market because of course China has a lot of appetite and Brazilian farmer was selling. So we saw that flow. We're going to have higher volumes which we saw those higher volumes and we see it event even during Q2. So I would say, given that they work in exceptional volumes, the performance has been a stellar because to be honest, minimal disruptions. Some disruptions in Argentina because the Parana River is very low in water. So we have to move some of the loads to Baia Blanca, a little bit more in the ocean side of the country, but also there, we've been loading well, only we changed the port. So I would say \u2013 and then even around the world Romania had record exports and the ports were there as well. So I think they will be happy \u2013 we will be happy there. In terms of how I see Brazil in general, this COVID, I think, May is going to be a tough month because we are fighting these two streams. On one side the economy and the social pressure to come back to work and the people basically need for their livelihoods. But the number of cases is still going up. And I think the ability to control that makes me a little bit worried about in general, the health situation in Brazil May. But other than that, I would say so far maybe diary was the segment that had been impacted the most from our customers\u2019 perspective. But for the rest so far the business for us has been strong.\nOperator: Vincent Anderson with Stifel, your line is open.\nVincent Anderson: Thanks for sneaking me in. Just quickly on Neovia. I was hoping you can breakout the improvement in the quarter between: one, the synergies, obviously the $10 million adjustment from last year broader revenue improvement and then maybe any seasonal factors just for the purpose of framing what the new baseline of earnings power should be for that business all of equal?\nJuan Luciano: Yes I'm not sure I have the breakout that easy, but let me say the following there. The Neovia, the way you need to think about it is because it's very diversified geographically and very diversified in the different sub segments. So I don't want to go into a long explanation, but I think the important thing, if you remember when we acquired Neovia, what I said that the Neovia story was actually a margin up story. So it was very complimentary to ADM from a geographical perspective and business perspective, but it was a margin up story. And although our business in Animal Nutrition was above 9% EBITDA margin on sales or where about, the Neovia business was lower than that. And then our expectation was to start moving up that business in two or three phases. And I am happy to report that margins are improving Neovia as we described. So we went from the margin of about 6.5% to about 9.50% in the Q1. So it's a business that is starting to get closer to our first original goal of about 10%. And then we were planning to go into the lower teens. So it's a business that again, has so many segments and so many geographies and they are all recovering differently and being impacted differently. So I don't think that the Q1 yet is a very good quarter for us to go into a lot of analysis into the future because again we have all these economies, there is a lot of Southeast Asia that is still is impacted by coronavirus. There is China that is coming back. There is Brazil that hasn't been impacted. There is Mexico that is being impacted right now. There is North America that is more impacted. So I think that second quarter will give us maybe a better time to make this analysis. But the business will continue to improve. We are revisiting the synergy numbers, of course, after we achieve \u20ac50 million target that we set for ourselves. So, we're still \u2013 there's still going to be growth rate, positive growth rate. There is still going to be increasing EBITDA margin on sales. It's just that the market at this point in time is too fluid to develop the algorithm right now.\nVincent Anderson: That\u2019s fair enough. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our final question comes from line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: Thank you everyone. Thank you for squeezing me in. I want to ask a question on Ag Services, something you haven't talked about a lot on this call. Just thinking about the outlook over the balance of the year with what looks to be much bigger U.S. supply of corn than potentially beans. Just given the planted acreage and the loss on demand in ethanol, just wanted to get your sense, the outlook for that business is actually improving probably more second-half weighted, but just the view today relative to where you might have been three months ago.\nRay Young: I think\u2026\nJuan Luciano: Yes, go ahead Ray.\nRay Young: I think we are actually encouraged in terms of Ag Services, in terms of how they started out in the first quarter, very strong results. We're also encouraged like the planning estimates in the United States are actually fairly strong, too. So it would be quite an improvement in terms of the acreage this year compared to last year where it was negatively impacted by weather. So we should actually have some \u2013 assuming the weather holds up and the planning gets in, we should actually have a very good crop of both corn and soybeans as we kind of go through this year in United States. I think the big variable, Adam, is going to be the China and the Phase 1 deal. As Juan indicated, we're very encouraged in terms of China coming in the first quarter to buy, frankly, a whole portfolio of agricultural products, you got sorghum, you got wheat, you got corn and then some soybeans also right now. So we are very encouraged in terms of what China is doing right now in terms of agricultural purchases and all the signals that we're getting and from both the U.S. side and the China side is that they will be executing their agricultural portion of Phase 1 consistent with what they had talked about. So we think as we kind of move through the year that the China will be increasing the amount of purchases of U.S. agricultural products. So you are already seeing that significantly in terms of animal proteins, pork, meat, chicken. I mean, the year-over-year purchases by China are an area of like 300% higher in terms of pork and big numbers in terms of poultry and beef as well. But in terms of soybeans, we are still thinking that for the year it could be 30 million metric tons to 35 million metric tons of purchases from United States as we move through the year. And that's going to be very supportive in terms of the Ag Services business, particularly in the back half of the year here. So overall, I have to say that we're very constructive. If China buys corn in addition to soybeans, that's going to be extremely constructive. And then the other variable, I just want to mention, is that ethanol as part Phase 1 deal is being viewed as part of the agricultural basket in terms of purchases. So as China moves towards honoring the $36 billion of agricultural purchases, it's very possible that ethanol will enter the picture, particularly in the fourth quarter now.\nAdam Samuelson: All right, I think, I will stop it there. Thanks so much.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Victoria de la Huerga.\nVictoria de la Huerga: Thank you for joining us today. Slide 12 notes some upcoming investor events in which we will be participating. As always, please feel free to follow-up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day. And thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: This concludes the ADM first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Victoria. Thank you to everyone who is joining us. I hope everyone listening is staying safe and healthy. These are obviously extraordinary times, so I would like to take a little time today to share with you my thoughts on three important topics. First, how ADM is working to protect our teams and how we're continuing to provide nutrition to the world. Second, how we are thinking about our strategy and long-term plans in this unique times. And third, some views of the near and medium term demand environment and market conditions. Let me start by offering my thanks to our global team and partners. Across more than 800 facilities and thousands of transportation assets around the globe, ADM colleagues in the first quarter not only maintained our operations, but in some areas set production records. These men and women are supporting the global food supply chain and because of them millions, even billions of people who don't know ADM can eat every day. We are grateful for that commitment. Thousands of other colleagues have been enabled by our IT team to work remotely and are showing their flexibility and ingenuity to keep the rest of our business running smoothly. Just a month ago, we were having discussions about whether we would be able to have this earnings call on our normal quarterly schedule, or whether we should delay a week or more. Thanks to our global business services, IT and financial teams, we closed our Q1 books and we are ready to have this call with you today. Take this across 38,000 colleagues and you can see why, as of today, AVM is continuing to fulfill our purpose by providing nutrition around the globe without any significant operational interruptions due to COVID-19 outbreaks. I am honored and grateful to be part of this great team. And I hope all of our ADM colleagues who are listening on this call are proud of their achievements as well. Our leadership team is doing everything we can to support our colleagues. Circumstances changed fast, so every morning since early February, our cross functional leadership team has met to review the global situation, evaluate new risks, and make timely decisions to protect our teams and our business. We put in place strict guidelines to protect our employees and contractors from enacting travel restrictions early in the year, to a critical focus on enabling social distances in our production facilities, to ongoing remote work. When colleagues do develop symptoms, we have protocols designed to protect them and others who might have come in contact with them, as well as support continuity of operations. This includes paid leave for all colleagues during required quarantine periods where necessary to support them and their families. So far, only a relatively small number of ADM colleagues have tested positive. Tragically, we did suffer our first COVID-related fatality two weeks ago. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been personally impacted by this disease. Our ADM colleague emergency fund is available for team members who are facing economic hardship due to the crisis. And through ADM Cares we have committed funds and other resources to support others in communities around the world who are serving on the front lines in the fight against COVID-19. We also made some early decisions in order to strengthen ADM's position during what was sure to be a challenging operational and economic environment. For example, our balance sheet has historically been a source of strength for ADM. And in March, we further enhanced our cash position and reduced our exposure to short term credit market risks by issuing $1.5 billion in term debt. We are taking other actions, including reducing capital spending to reflect practical limitations in these environments \u2013 in this environment, while still completing projects necessary to maintain our facilities in same hot productive order and advanced critical strategic projects. Our team is delivering. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.64. Adjusted segment operating profit was $643 million. And our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 7.6%. Our performance is a testament to our team's ability to fulfill our critical role in the global food supply chain and deliver results to our shareholders, despite incredibly challenging circumstances. Please turn to Slide 4. As you can see even amid these global challenges, we're also continuing our work to ensure ADM remains strong and vital in the years to come. We are not slowing down in our commitment to delivering our strategy, nor in our focus on the business drivers under our control and our actions to improve the company. I am proud that even as our team was keeping our operations running under difficult circumstances, they also made great progress advancing the strategic imperatives we've defined this year, with accomplishments like improving capital efficiency in Ag Services & Oilseeds, advancing our center of expertise structure with the new global supply chain organization and delivering on our Neovia synergies more than two years ahead of our target. And we continue to advance readiness, which since the program began, has unlocked $920 million in run-rate benefits on an annual basis. All told, thanks to our team's great work we have achieved about 30% of our $500 million to $600 million in targeted improvements for 2020 and we continue to feel good about reaching our goal by the end of the year. We are also ensuring we live up to our critical role as steel were not just of our company, but of the natural resources that are vital to our business and our future. In 2011, we announced our \u201c15x20\u201d plan in which we committed to per unit improvements in energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, water waste to landfill by 2020. We met each of those goals ahead of schedule and this year we were proud to unveil even more ambitious commitments to reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% and our energy intensity by 15% in the next 15 years. Finally, I would like to talk a little bit about our world view of the markets and our future. With major western economies shut down. We are encouraged by the actions many nations are taking to contain the spread of COVID-19 and enabled an eventual recovery. How that recovery unfolds where and at what pace is something we'll be monitoring very carefully. And while precise predictions of these points are difficult, there are a few ways we can categorize some of the market impacts we're seeing. We saw short term acceleration in demand for certain products, such a flower, or stapled packaged goods that we provide flavors and ingredients for as consumers loaded their pantries in advance to stay-at-home orders. Many of these products have reached or will reach saturation point and we expect demand to normalize. Then there are products that have been impacted as a direct result of the various national and local stay-at-home orders. For ADM, that includes refined oils, or food service, as well as biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel. As you know, we've made the difficult decision last week to idle two of our dry mills amid continued low gasoline demand. We would expect to see some of these demand build back in as economies reopen, though there will be a significant variability depending on when and how those re-openings occur. We're also seeing volatility in margin environments for certain commodity products, as markets constantly reevaluate global supply and demand balances due to a variety of factors. One key element we're following closely here is the Phase 1 trade agreement with China. We've seen good buying of U.S. agricultural products by China so far this year, which could bode well for future purchases in the back half of the year. Equally as importantly, our global footprint gives us continued confidence in our ability to support global trade flows of food and agricultural products. Then there are the changing behaviors which might have longer term impacts. For example, in the food market we are seeing a back-to-basics approach, desire for comfort foods, snacks and staple goods, while consumers are staying home. We're seeing consumers increasing their purchases online, which impacts the demand for industrial starches used to make cardboard. And we are seeing an increase in interest in products that support health and wellness. There are many unknowns. What we do know, however, is that the transformation that ADM has undertaken over the last several years is now helping ensure that we're well equipped to pivot to whatever our customers require and whatever the world needs. We built up our product portfolio, our footprint, our innovation and our agility. And we are planning for the future. For example, we thought about the potential for changes in how we all interact with each other, our team launched virtual innovation sessions with customers in order to ensure we can continue to meet their needs. We aren't immune from some of the negative effects of the pandemic and its economic fallout. But we're confident in the ability of our great team to continue to provide nutrition around the globe. Now Ray will take us through our business performance before I come back to offer some final comments, before we go to Q&A. Ray, please. Thank you, Ray. I spoke a lot at the beginning of the call, so I'll just close by saying this. The core of our existence is the belief that food is fundamental. It sustains us, fulfills us and fuels our well being. Today, our role in providing for that need is more critical than ever. All of our teams are putting safety first as they support the global food supply chain. We're meeting needs that have changed dramatically in just the last few months and we'll be there to continue to provide nutrition to the world as we emerged from this challenge, I've never been prouder to be part of this team and this company, and I never been more confident about our ability to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. With that, Jack, please open the line for questions. Good morning, Ben. Yes. Let me start, Ben and I then Ray can touch on the mark-to-market. So I think what happened \u2013 what you see in the first quarter is that the bean market was supported basically by Chinese buying simply by \u2013 while the mill value is impacted by demand issues. So you see a cash margins in beans that they tend to track board crash. But this quarter, the impact of soybean bases, as the ability of the farmer to hold the beans increase, impacted our margins. So margins are down year-to-year by about $15 per ton. So I think that that's quite explains the situation. Of course we have expectations that the overall temporary adjustment of the shift in demand will subside as some of this \u2013 some of our customers manage this adjustment. But I think in North America that was the biggest impact, if you will. Soybean, crush soybean base is high and mill values being a little bit soft due to lack of demand in food service. With regards to the mark-to-market, I think Ray can provide some more granularity on that. Yes. I will say as we look at the demand for Starches and Sweeteners, Ben, we see that that the demand was strong for us at least in January and February. So I think that we saw some decline in demand in March, but not that significant. We see \u2013 we saw more significant demand decline in April. Over the last two weeks, I'm talking about mostly Sweeteners and Starches. Over the last two weeks we have seen orders pick-up bunk a little bit again, so maybe there is a little bit more energy in the food service markets around the world right now. So I would say a demand of Sweeteners and Starches we're going to see a bigger impact in second quarter that maybe we saw in the first quarter. Of course the second quarter we have less of a mark-to-market corn oil issues and we will continue to enjoy some of the improvements. The operational improvements were strong. The improvement on European operations were strong and milling had a very good quarter, and we're going to have some as you said, lower net corn cost of all that. So \u2013 but when you take all the puts and takes with a slower demand, we probably see a slight improvement versus Q1 into Q2 but not a significant one. Rob, I think that it depends on the business and our exposure to food service versus retail. So if you go to the milling business; the milling business had a very good first quarter and we had a good demand everywhere in the world. If you see the nutrition business, I have less exposure to food service was a very strong quarter and that continues to grow. So I would say, they all said depends on your mix. When we go to things like, for example, the corn oil \u2013 corn oil goes more to retail. So we saw better demand for, for things like chips. On the other hand, soybean oil goes to more to foodservice. So we see a little bit of weakness there. When we're talking about food service we think though that probably we saw the trust in late, late April, maybe the orders at the \u2013 for the beginning for May and we started to see over the last two weeks, things becoming a little bit better. So I think we are a little bit more optimistic as some of the economies start to reopen. We start to see that. We have the benefit of being a global company. We see that pandemic have all been from East to West. So we're seeing already food services in Asia getting back to maybe 70% to 80% of where they used to be. Of course much more on food deliveries and takeouts and things like that than actually in-room dining. But we see a little bit of that come back. So again, I think you should think about for ADM the impact has been more in food services North America, in terms oil because even package oils in Europe and South America, since South America and Europe has less impact to food service. We have been a little bit more robust on the last point of your question or regarding animal nutrition. How would animal nutrition with the acquisition of Neovia has become very global and very much diversified into many, many applications and business subsections. So we saw strength on that and we expect a lot of that strength to continue. North America has been more impacted and yes, we're going to see some of that reduction in feed in North America, probably in the second quarter more immediately than in the West. Yes. Of course, that, I mean, it's unfortunate all this impact that COVID has been having in so many people and so many industries. And when we look at the demand for soybean meal, with everything that's happened, of course, it's going to be lower than we have anticipated before. But I think you need to think about this as a temporary adjustment. Most of our customers are shifting as quickly as possible from foodservice to retail. That's probably is going to be \u2013 there is still a strong demand in the retail area. And we started to see much more the increase of China imports from the United States in terms of pork and poultry, and that will help medium-term also to exacerbate the demand for soybean meal. So medium term, we are constructive. I think in the short term, we need to go through this volatility of customers shifting their patterns. And we will have to go through that probably in Q2. You're welcome Rob. No, that's all right. Thank you, Ben. So let me start with COVID and how I see the world now versus how I saw it the last time we spoke. First of all, I'm proud and also a little bit surprised how well we managed to keep the operations going through all this. If you have told me that we will be running more than 800 plants around the world with minimum staffing, with people in quarantine and running the rest of the company remotely, I mean, I think it's testament of the resilience of the ADM people and business model. So very proud of that. Second, I think fundamentally, we remain very confident because, first of all, we hit the ground running this year and almost ahead of schedule in most of our improvements. Remember, we call for $500 million to $600 million of self-help here. And as I said in my remarks, we are through 25% of the year, we're probably 30% accomplished there. So I'm happy with that. I'm happy with we are executing in Neovia. We achieved synergies three years ahead of schedule. So the team is clicking on all the boxes that we promised to shareholders and to the Board that we were going to do. In terms of demand, I'm normally a little bit more relaxed because we are in the food industry. We are blessed with that, and there is the same number of mouths out there eating. So our role of it in the world continues to be as important as before. We need to go through this shift and this shift benefits some businesses and creates short-term disruptions in some other business, but the fundamental impact of COVID in the first quarter was to the carbohydrate solution business in terms of death and all. There was some biodiesel, but biodiesel North America navigated it better. South America and Europe was a little bit more impacted in terms of biodiesel. But I will say the big impact was scarf solution in ethanol. And that is something that \u2013 it was a very big impact because we were coming already in a situation of high inventories and the industry has negative margins already by the time we get into that. And \u2013 but you see us again focusing on why we can control them, so what we did in crush, for example, we have adjusted crush margins in North America, crush rates in \u2013 operating rates in North America to offset the little bit \u2013 the short term issue on demand that we're having. And we took the difficult decision of take two of the dry mills down in North America. So, I see fundamentally the demand being solid for us. Margins are still good margins. And I still see all the things that the business has been under management team has been focused on hitting in all cylinders and going a little bit ahead of schedule as of Neovia, or the $500 million to $600 million and the readiness efforts. When talking about nutrition, I said to all of our investors over the last year and a half that they been supporting us through all the investment phase in nutrition and nutrition have not been showing that in the P&L because this was organic growth and we have some \u2013 some growing pains into some of these assets as you build them and you have to finance them. But when you see now what's starting to happen is what we predicted before is all those wins, all that innovation, we always said we have our value proposition is resonating with our customers. We had that. That line was a little bit masked by all these organic growth that was coming. Now all that organic growth is hitting the P&Ls because these investments are maturing. And you're going to see that and we grew 23% profits last year. We are growing \u2013 we are going to grow another north of 20% this year. You see WFSI during this. So take Neovia and animal nutrition out for a minute since the first quarter is a little bit of a strange comparison because we acquired this last first quarter. So but if you take WFSI, WFSI has grown earnings up 28% in the first quarter. So we continue a little bit rhythm of 23 that we deliver last year and flavors are growing at revenue at 7.8%. So, we feel pretty good about that business. It's a very diversified business. And if anything we experienced in COVID with people that come back from this pandemic like we've seen in Asia, is that people come back with a more \u2013 with an enhanced focus on health and then the importance of quality nutrition for their wellbeing. So we've seen the probiotics our health and wellness segment is up like 24% in terms of revenue because the sales of those products are \u2013 for humans has been probably reemphasized by all this COVID. So we think that we are in the right segments. We think we have the right product mix. So we feel very bullish about \u2013 continue this performance for the nutrition business. Thank you, Ben. Good morning, Tom. I think on biodiesel demand what we're seeing, Tom, is in Europe we're actually seeing more of a hit in terms of our biodiesel demand. A part of it is just simply due to the fact that as in Europe, passenger cars actually use diesel a lot in addition to commercial vehicles. And so when you have to shelter-in-place orders come in for Europe, it really negatively impacted the demand environment over there. What's interesting in the United States, we actually have not seen that that drop-off. In fact in the early part of the quarter, we actually saw strong demand for diesel because as you know, trucks, the trucking industry were actually running very, very hard in order to keep the warehouses supplied. And as airlines kind of shut down, a lot of the goods actually start moving on the truck front. So, we've seen on the biodiesel front, which is tied to the really diesel demand that the United States actually has held up reasonably well. In terms of our block, our biodiesel block, we've got it. A lot of it already sold out into the second and third quarter. So we feel good about \u2013 this part of the business is actually holding up right now. Good morning Ken. Well, as I said before, we have adjusted crush in North America a little bit. So we ran hard in the first quarter. And then at the end of March we adjusted crush into April a little bit. So we are monitoring all that. And as I said before, I think, that soybean oil mostly has been affected in the oil side in North America. It has been more biodiesel impact in the other places, but package oils has been more robust in the other two geographies in Europe and South America. Yes, I think in Europe margins are $25 to $35 per ton, so a little bit better. And I think that a couple of things, Argentine crush is still not a major threat to Europe, maybe in six to eight weeks, when the product of all the harvest start hitting the shores of Europe maybe. And then I think that having the \u2013 meat is in very good demand in Europe for all the retail issue and the retail segment. And meat packers in Europe have smaller plants. So I think that they have fewer people in all the plants. So the issue of maybe COVID spreading among workers had been less of an issue there. The issue in Europe has been of course the biodiesel as Ray mentioned before, biodiesel is used more for passenger transportation in Europe, so that was absolutely shut down. And so we adjusted the rate to some of those plans. At the moment we are running as much soya crush as we can in Europe, of course, given our advantage there. Brazil margins are more in the $15 to $25 per ton. They are the big farmer selling. Demand for oil has been \u2013 for package oil has been good. And then biodiesel we've been able to move enough biodiesel there in Brazil, this is tied to economic activity. And less of a passenger drive, passenger car there. And we've been able to manage more of that. Demand for meat has I continued to be very strong. Most of our customers, they are exporting a lot of their meat to China. So that demand has been very strong. And other than one announcement of a plant with some issues in poultry a week ago all the plants of our customers have been running in Brazil. So far so good in Brazil. So I would say one of the big things that we noticed this quarter in terms of soybean oil has been the great benefits of having the global trade desk actually working together to facilitate that we continue to crush hard, because basically they took care of the oil, exporting that oil. And you see the one of the benefits of the combination between the Ag Services business and Oilseeds is it business is that the global trade works either to place a little bit more of North America mill into export markets or a lot of the oil into the export market so our plants can continue to run. That has been very beneficial to us. Yes Ken, that's a good question. I think it depends on probably the duration of this situation. The industry is working at the lowest production rates ever. And I think that we saw more than 70 plants going down. And for somebody that have run plants before it depends on how long it takes for that plant to be down. After a few months, things start becoming complicated and maybe fewer of those plants will be able to come back. So it depends how quickly margins, rebound. But I would say if there is a prolonged activity or low gasoline prices and margins continue to be down for a while, I think, you will see some players not coming back, whether that's enough to restructure the industry is probably a tall order question there that I would not guess to answer at this point. Yes, I think, that during the first quarter we saw, I mean, as you see March when we saw the decline in economic activity around the world that became the limiting factor for crush, it was like, you know, do you have an outset? Do you have a house for soybean oil? As I said, we have been good at using our integration to make that soybean oil disappear and keep crush margins up. Of course the longer this takes inventories start to pop and not everybody have the same ability to place those things with us. And there is a lot of people fighting for liquid storage these days in North America. But I would say, I think, we are comfortable with the level of adjustment in production that we have at this point. We adjusted about five percentage points. And I think for now that that's good. So we don't foresee more at this point. And as I said before, Heather we started to see... Yes I'm talking about ADM specifically, I wouldn't venture about what's going to happen for the rest of the industry. But as I said we have that benefit of that integration with the global trade. But I would say over the last week and two weeks as China started to reopen and as Europe prepares to reopen and then in some cases they have done, so we started to see a little bit more activity. And I don't know if people replenishing pipeline in preparation for the summer or what. But orders have popped up a little bit over the last two weeks in general for ADM. You are welcome Heather. Yes. Well, we didn't have WFSI on the last recession, so it's difficult to compare. But I think it's a good question in the sense that the business is relatively less exposed to food service than there may be other segments that we have in the company. And it's very, very diversified because the systems, and the flavors and the pantry is so broad that goes into almost every product, whether it's food or beverage. So I would say a pretty resistance in that point. I think that the thing that we are watching very careful is not that much the absolute demand, which we feel comfortable whether it maybe softer in previous scores than it was in Q1 may be there is some adjustment to pantry filling. But I think what we are seeing is our win rates, our ability to place new orders or bring new products have been strong. Our ability to provide existing sales of existing products to existing customers have been good. And I think that what we may see, because we saw that in Asia, it's a little bit of deceleration in innovations in food services in the first quarter because logically companies as they focus more on delivery or pickups or e-commerce, they tend to emphasize their traditional products. You are not going to go to a food service restaurant and order take out something new, you normally go to something that you know. So we've seen a little bit of decline and that started to come back slowly. But that probably will be the shift. The shift is maybe that we sell more of existing products than the proportion we used to sell off innovative products. So we think that the impact of the recession may be a little bit of a delay in the introduction of our new products. Thank you, Vince. Yes, I would say listen, the team identify of course very early on potentially ports could be a weak point in terms of the COVID issue. And we took all kinds of precautions to make sure that that was not the case, so it was not impacted. And I would say at this point in time, we have no issues in terms of being able to load. There may be a little bit of an extra cost here and there, but nothing, nothing material that we should worry about. In Argentina there has been a little bit of \u2013 even in the phase, to be honest, when I said we were preparing because we were preparing for the big export market because of course China has a lot of appetite and Brazilian farmer was selling. So we saw that flow. We're going to have higher volumes which we saw those higher volumes and we see it event even during Q2. So I would say, given that they work in exceptional volumes, the performance has been a stellar because to be honest, minimal disruptions. Some disruptions in Argentina because the Parana River is very low in water. So we have to move some of the loads to Baia Blanca, a little bit more in the ocean side of the country, but also there, we've been loading well, only we changed the port. So I would say \u2013 and then even around the world Romania had record exports and the ports were there as well. So I think they will be happy \u2013 we will be happy there. In terms of how I see Brazil in general, this COVID, I think, May is going to be a tough month because we are fighting these two streams. On one side the economy and the social pressure to come back to work and the people basically need for their livelihoods. But the number of cases is still going up. And I think the ability to control that makes me a little bit worried about in general, the health situation in Brazil May. But other than that, I would say so far maybe diary was the segment that had been impacted the most from our customers' perspective. But for the rest so far the business for us has been strong. Yes I'm not sure I have the breakout that easy, but let me say the following there. The Neovia, the way you need to think about it is because it's very diversified geographically and very diversified in the different sub segments. So I don't want to go into a long explanation, but I think the important thing, if you remember when we acquired Neovia, what I said that the Neovia story was actually a margin up story. So it was very complimentary to ADM from a geographical perspective and business perspective, but it was a margin up story. And although our business in Animal Nutrition was above 9% EBITDA margin on sales or where about, the Neovia business was lower than that. And then our expectation was to start moving up that business in two or three phases. And I am happy to report that margins are improving Neovia as we described. So we went from the margin of about 6.5% to about 9.50% in the Q1. So it's a business that is starting to get closer to our first original goal of about 10%. And then we were planning to go into the lower teens. So it's a business that again, has so many segments and so many geographies and they are all recovering differently and being impacted differently. So I don't think that the Q1 yet is a very good quarter for us to go into a lot of analysis into the future because again we have all these economies, there is a lot of Southeast Asia that is still is impacted by coronavirus. There is China that is coming back. There is Brazil that hasn't been impacted. There is Mexico that is being impacted right now. There is North America that is more impacted. So I think that second quarter will give us maybe a better time to make this analysis. But the business will continue to improve. We are revisiting the synergy numbers, of course, after we achieve \u20ac50 million target that we set for ourselves. So, we're still \u2013 there's still going to be growth rate, positive growth rate. There is still going to be increasing EBITDA margin on sales. It's just that the market at this point in time is too fluid to develop the algorithm right now. Yes, go ahead Ray."

            "content": "Thanks, Juan. Good day everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. I like to start by echoing Jyan's thanks to our ADM colleagues around the globe. We are fortunate to have this team and very grateful for their dedication. As Juan mentioned, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up from the $0.46 in the prior year quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $643 million. Our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 7.6%, higher than our 2020 WACC of 5.75%. In our trailing four-quarter average adjusted EBITDA was about $3.5 billion. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was approximately a positive 4% compared to an expense of 26% in the prior year. The favorable current quarter rate was due primarily to the impact of U.S. tax credits signed into law in December including railway maintenance tax credits. The tax credits primarily benefit our business partners and are substantially passed on to them through the prices of goods and services we negotiate to support their respective businesses. That maintenance expense is reflected in the cost of goods sold line of our GAAP statements and then the other charges line in the management statements. Looking ahead, we're now expecting effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15% before any discrete tax items. We generated about $800 million of cash from operations before working capital for the year, higher than 2019. Return of capital for the full year was about $315 million including about $110 million in opportunistic share repurchases that will offset dilution for the year. We finished the quarter with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 29%, down from the 32% a year ago. Capital spending for the quarter was about $200 million. As Juan said in view of a more challenging environment to execute capital projects, for example, due to social distancing consideration, we're reducing our capital spending plans. We expect spending for the year to be closer to $800 million, down from our initial guidance. We'll continue to advance projects and invest in maintenance necessary to run our operations safely and effectively, of course, but some discretionary projects will be put on hold. Next slide please. Over the past several years, we have been diversifying our sources of funding particularly working capital funding so as not to be relying on any one source. These new sources of funding include Euro CP facilities, U.S. and International receivable securitization facilities, and the structured trade financing facilities. In March, we added to this diversification by putting in place a U.S. inventory financing facility. As it became apparent that the COVID-19 situation could disrupt capital markets, we put in place additional global credit facilities as well as issued $1.5 billion of term debt in order to minimize rollover risk of our commercial paper program. The term debt was rated solid single A. In addition, we have been approved for the Federal Reserve's commercial paper funding facility, which would serve as an additional backstop to our U.S. commercial paper facility. As a result, at the end of March we had cash and marketable securities of $4.7 billion and available untapped global credit facilities of $5.9 billion. The $4.7 billion of cash is much higher than the normal $1 billion that we would normally carry. As a precaution due to dislocations in the short-term credit markets we saw in the month of March. In future quarter ends, you should expect us to carry significantly lower cash balances as we now have the other liquidity facilities in place. We also had $5.6 billion of readily marketable inventories, which if needed we could sell very quickly and turn into cash. When taken together, we feel confident that we will be able to comfortably weather any prolonged downside economic scenarios and continue funding all of our financial and capital spending obligations including dividends in the foreseeable future. Please turn to Slide 7. Other business results were slightly down year-over-year. Futures commission loss provisions were partially offset by improvements in captive insurance operations. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $189 million were slightly higher year-over-year principally due to the continued investments in IT and business transformation. Other charges increased due to the railroad maintenance expenses that I referred to earlier that we funded on behalf of U.S. short line railroads and which had an offsetting credit and tax expense, partially offset by improved foreign hedging results on intercompany funding. Net interest expense for the quarter was lower than last year, benefiting from lower average borrowing costs from liability management actions taken in late 2019. Effective January 1st, we decided to discontinue LIFO inventory valuation method accounting. And the corporate results include a LIFO credit of $91 million or $0.12 per share due to the reversal of the LIFO reserve balance. Please turn to slide 8. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team did a great job to deliver strong results. Ag Services results more than doubled versus the first quarter of 2019, which was negatively impacted by high water conditions in North America. Excellent performances in destination marketing and structured trade finance drove extremely strong results in global trade. Robust farmer selling in Brazil drove higher year-over-year origination volumes and margins, which were partially offset by weaker results in North America. Crushing results were lower than the prior-year-period. The team delivered high overall crushed volumes including a Q1 record for soy crush. Execution margins were solid, though below the high realized margins in the first quarter of 2019, which benefited from the short crop in Argentina. The prior-year quarter also benefited from about $75 million of positive timing impacts. Refined Products and other results were higher than the first quarter of 2019. Higher margins in both biodiesel and refined oils in North America were offset by lower biodiesel margins in EMEA. Peanut shelling results were significantly improved versus the prior-year period; as our improvement actions continued to strengthen that business. Wilmar results were significantly higher year-over-year due to stronger performances in tropicals and oilseeds and grain. Slide 9 please. Carbohydrate Solutions results were lower than the first quarter of 2019. As a reminder starting this quarter, we are reporting different subsegments within this business. The new Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including wet mill ethanol results, was down year-over-year, largely due to about $50 million in negative mark-to-market impacts on forward sales of corn oil, much of which could reverse over the balance of the year. Absent those impacts, results were higher due to improved manufacturing costs driven impart by improvements made at the Decatur complex last year. Strong results in wheat milling as customers fill pantries and improved performance and conditions in EMEA including stronger demand and lower input costs. Vantage Corn Processors or VCP which includes our dry mill ethanol results was slightly higher versus the prior year. Effective risk management, combined with the lack of severe weather impacts seen in the first quarter of 2019, helped offset weak industry ethanol margins caused by significantly decreased demand. To bring the transition \u2013 to bridge the transition this quarter under the prior segmentation of Carbohydrate Solutions, the old Starches and Sweeteners would have reported above $160 million of operating profit. And the bio products segments would have reported about negative $92 million of losses, including the $50 million of negative mark-to-market impacts, which would have been split roughly equally between the two sub-segments. We have also included a pro former 2019 restatement of Carbohydrate Solutions in the appendix to this presentation. Slide 10 please. Nutrition continued its growth trajectory with record results. Our Human Nutrition businesses formerly known as WFSI delivered strong performance and growth across the broad portfolio including flavors, especially ingredients and health and wellness. Increased sales revenue in North America and EMEA flavors, continued sales growth in alternative proteins, and additional bioactives income helped drive improved results. As Juan mentioned earlier, we did see higher demand in some human nutrition areas as a result of new wins as well as some pantry loading effects. Animal Nutrition improved year-over-year results were driven by a strong performance from Neovia, good volumes and margins in feed additives, and solid sales in pet care. The prior year quarter also had been negatively impacted by about $10 million in upfront purchase price adjustments related to Neovia. Amino acids were negatively impacted by a year-over-year decline in the global pricing environment though prices were directly improved over Q4 of 2019 we are also very pleased that we met our Neovia synergy targets more than two years early. Our forward look includes some uncertainty as the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continue to reverberate through the global economy. Despite this uncertainty as Juan indicated earlier, we remain focused on the drivers under our control and we're on track to deliver to that target range of controllable benefits this year. Now turning to the second quarter directionally. First, Ag Services and Oilseeds we expect segment results to be lower than Q1 subject to mark-to-market impacts as Ag Services seasonally normalizes, crush margins have come off to highs and the RPO business has some headwinds on near-term demand. In Carbohydrate Solutions, we expect the second quarter to be slightly better than Q1 of this year, but much lower than the year ago quarter, as ethanol industry demand and margins continue to be a negative driver and food service demand negatively impacts negatively impacts Starches and Sweeteners. For nutrition, we feel confident that the business will continue to advance to another calendar year of 20% plus growth. Now please turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back over to Juan. Good morning, Ben. Yes. On the mark-to-market impact as I indicated, last year if you recall we had some very stable mark-to-market impacts about $75 million. This quarter we didn't \u2013 I didn't highlight anything on the call because it was not material, but if you recall, like we entered the quarter with a fairly large balance in terms of deferred gains. But what happened, as you know, is the board crush actually went up during the course of March, right? And so therefore we actually had mark-to-market losses there. And so when you actually take into account of the deferred gains coming into the quarter, and then the mark-to-market \u2013 the new mark-to-market losses that we took as board crush went up, they netted out to be fairly immaterial. I mean, it's just really not meaningful in terms of the overall results there. I do want to remind you, it's actually in your supplemental information that at the end of the first quarter we still have about $80 million of deferred gains that will be recognized as we kind of move through the rest of the year there. So hopefully that will help you in terms of understanding where the mark-to-market currently stands. Thank you, Ben. Yes. From a capital allocation perspective as you know this year we are focused on further deleveraging the balance sheet to get towards our low twos target range in terms of debt to EBITDA. At the same time as you pointed out me there could be opportunities out there and we're always looking at opportunities out there. So, nothing, nothing clear right now, but I think we'll just keep an open \u2013 keep our ears and eyes open. But again, priority at least in the near term is to get our balance sheet into a little bit lower in terms of the leverage position. Yes, I can confirm that. Again, on a GAAP statement, it's in the cost of goods sold on the management statements you can look at the other charges line and that full amount \u2013 and if you look in the appendix, you can see all the information there, like the $73 million of tax credits is fully reflected in the other chargers line of the management statement there. Yes, you're right. I've never really talked about mark-to-market on corn oil before in prior earnings calls. And frankly, the last time we actually saw this was about 10 years ago. So, what happened was as ethanol plants slowed down around the country then as you know corn oil is a byproduct of ethanol production. And so, we actually saw a reduction in terms of supply of corn oil. At the same time as Juan indicated earlier, we actually saw a significant demand for fried snacks like chips. So actually demand for corn oil actually went up. And so, we actually start seeing a divergence between soybean oil prices and corn oil prices, which again, historically tracked very closely with one another. And so, as corn oil prices, and this really occurred \u2013 started occurring at the end of March, as corn oil prices moved up, we have a forward book of sales contracts in corn oil and some of those sales contracts are actually indexed to bean oil, right. And that's just because of history in terms of how \u2013 how these prices have correlated. So when we actually mark the book at the end of March for the forward sales contracts that were indexed to bean oil. We actually had to take a mark-to-market loss on that. Now I do expect, as I indicated in my comments that part of this mark-to-market impact it should reverse, it could reverse as we kind of move through the year, due to two factors. One, with higher corn oil price, that means the corn product credit will actually go up as we kind of move through the year, which means net corn costs compared to where we were at the beginning of the year of the should actually come down. And then secondly, as we move through the year as ethanol production actually starts ramping up due to gasoline demand of returning, and as the shelter-in-place orders come off and maybe chip them in and start to come back off a little bit, then you should actually start seeing the historical correlation start returning back again. So that's the reason why I feel that it's kind of move through the next 12 months. Probably in the back half of the year, I should expect about half of the negative mark-to-market to come back in the form of other lower net corn cost, or mark-to-market reversals. As Juan indicated, I think, for the second quarter I do probably expect that the negative mark-to-market to kind of \u2013 it's not going to be the same magnitude of $50 million, but we may have some slightly negative mark-to-market in the second quarter as well in Carb Solutions. Hey Ken. No Heather, I know we were a little lower in the first quarter, but a lot of the initiatives that we announced in our fourth quarter call in terms of our business transformation \u2013 we have not slowed that down. In fact one argues that these business transformation initiatives are actually very, very important for the long term of ADM. And so we have not diverted from those particular, strategic initiatives there. So the guidance that we provided to you in the fourth quarter for the calendar years remains in place. I think the only thing that's changed in terms of below line is like interest expense. I think that with the addition of long-term debt that we put onto the balance sheet you should expect probably our net interest expense probably be similar to where we were last year. I think... I think we are actually encouraged in terms of Ag Services, in terms of how they started out in the first quarter, very strong results. We're also encouraged like the planning estimates in the United States are actually fairly strong, too. So it would be quite an improvement in terms of the acreage this year compared to last year where it was negatively impacted by weather. So we should actually have some \u2013 assuming the weather holds up and the planning gets in, we should actually have a very good crop of both corn and soybeans as we kind of go through this year in United States. I think the big variable, Adam, is going to be the China and the Phase 1 deal. As Juan indicated, we're very encouraged in terms of China coming in the first quarter to buy, frankly, a whole portfolio of agricultural products, you got sorghum, you got wheat, you got corn and then some soybeans also right now. So we are very encouraged in terms of what China is doing right now in terms of agricultural purchases and all the signals that we're getting and from both the U.S. side and the China side is that they will be executing their agricultural portion of Phase 1 consistent with what they had talked about. So we think as we kind of move through the year that the China will be increasing the amount of purchases of U.S. agricultural products. So you are already seeing that significantly in terms of animal proteins, pork, meat, chicken. I mean, the year-over-year purchases by China are an area of like 300% higher in terms of pork and big numbers in terms of poultry and beef as well. But in terms of soybeans, we are still thinking that for the year it could be 30 million metric tons to 35 million metric tons of purchases from United States as we move through the year. And that's going to be very supportive in terms of the Ag Services business, particularly in the back half of the year here. So overall, I have to say that we're very constructive. If China buys corn in addition to soybeans, that's going to be extremely constructive. And then the other variable, I just want to mention, is that ethanol as part Phase 1 deal is being viewed as part of the agricultural basket in terms of purchases. So as China moves towards honoring the $36 billion of agricultural purchases, it's very possible that ethanol will enter the picture, particularly in the fourth quarter now."

This morning, we reported record fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.50. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.4 billion, 23% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our trailing four quarter adjusted EBITDA was $4.9 billion, $1.25 billion more than a year ago, and our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 10%, meeting our objectives. Slide 4 please. That performance represented a strong finish to an astounding 2021. For the full year, our adjusted EPS was $5.19, also a record, and full year adjusted segment operating profit was $4.8 billion. This excellent performance was reflected across the company. [Indiscernible] its team\u2019s actions to improve their business portfolio and strengthen their operating model continues to enable superior performance in a strong market environment. AS&O delivered full year 2021 OP of $2.8 billion with each sub-segment performing at or near historic highs.  Carbohydrate solutions executed phenomenally well to deliver full year operating profits of $1.3 billion [indiscernible] from the sale of our Peoria grain dry mill and the announcement of the sustainable aviation fuel MoU through our agreement with [indiscernible] and the continuous growth of our exciting value solutions platform which delivered new revenue [indiscernible] with an annualized run rate of almost $100 billion, to the project we announced earlier this month to further decarbonize our operations by connecting two other major processing facilities to our Decatur carbon capture and storage capabilities. The nutrition team once again delivered industry-leading revenue and OP growth with full year revenues up 16% and full year OP of $691 million, representing a 20% year-over-year increase. We also continued to enhance our nutrition business with strategic investments targeted at growing areas of demand, including soy protein which will expand our participation in alternative proteins; PetDine, which substantially enhanced our presence in pet food and treats; Deerland, which continued the expansion of our functional probiotics and enzymes portfolio within our global health and wellness business; and FISA, which enhanced our flavor footprint by opening up new growth opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Slide 5 please. Last month at our global investor day, we unveiled our strategic plan and reiterated our balanced financial framework for value creation, including using our strong cash flows to deliver both growth investments and distributions to shareholders. We are confident in our plan and committee to continue to deliver value for our shareholders, which is why we are pleased to announce an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share.  We are proud of our record of 90 uninterrupted years of dividends and more than 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, and we are pleased to continue to follow through on our commitment to shareholder value creation.  It has been a great year and we are excited about what is to come. Our continuous actions to build a better ADM and dynamically align it with the global trends of food security, health and wellbeing and sustainability, and the steadfast advancement of our productivity and innovation initiatives will help propel our 2022 results.  I will talk in more detail about the upcoming calendar year shortly, but first I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ray to review our business performance. Ray?\nRay Young: Yes, thanks Juan. Good morning and good afternoon everyone.  Slide 6 please. The ag services and oilseeds team capped off really a truly impressive year, successfully navigating through supply chain challenges to deliver results largely in line with the extremely strong prior year quarter. The ag services team performed well in an environment of continued strong global demand, including significantly increased export volumes for customers outside of China. Global trade was substantially higher year over year, driven by solid risk management and improved results in global ocean freight. Overall, ag services delivered strong results just slightly off the outstanding fourth quarter of 2020, when we benefited from exceptionally high export margins. Crushing executed well in a continued solid demand environment for both soybean meal and vegetable oil. Lower results in EMEA versus a very strong fourth quarter of 2020 and approximately $250 million in net negative timing impacts versus negative $125 million in the prior year quarter drove overall results lower year over year. The majority of those negative timing effects are expected to reverse in the first half of 2022.  The refined products and other team delivered substantially higher results versus the prior year period, driven by strong volumes and margins in North America for refined oils and improved biodiesel margins in North American and EMEA, which more than offset weaker South American results due to the reduced biodiesel mandate. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher year over year. Looking ahead, we expect a strong first quarter from ag services and oilseeds, higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with the just ended fourth quarter.  Slide 7 please. Carbohydrate solutions fourth quarter results were more than double the prior year quarter. In starches and sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, results were lower versus the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by higher input costs, including energy costs in EMEA as well as lower wheat milling volumes, partially offset by continued strong ethanol margins. Volumes for North American sweeteners and starches were largely flat year over year. Vantage corn processor results were again substantially higher year over year, driven by historically strong industry ethanol margins as a result of strong demand relative to supply, as well as increased sales volumes due to production at the two dry mills that were idle in the previous year period. As we look ahead, we believe the first quarter for carbohydrate solutions should be similar to or slightly above the strong first quarter of 2021. Slide 8 please. The nutrition business closed out a year of consistent and strong growth with fourth quarter revenues 19% higher year over year, 21% on a constant currency basis with 26% higher profits year over year and sustained strong EBITDA margins. Human nutrition had a great fourth quarter with revenue growth of 21% on a constant currency basis and substantially higher profits. Flavors continued its growth trajectory driven primarily by improved product mix in EMEA and continued strong performance from North America, partially offset by weaker APAC results.  In specialty ingredients, overall profits for the fourth quarter were in line with the year ago period as strong demand for plant-based proteins offset the impact of one-time insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020. Health and wellness was higher versus the prior year quarter as the business continued to deliver growing profits in bioactives and fermentation. Animal nutrition revenue was up 21% on a constant currency basis and operating profit was much higher year over year, driven primarily by continued strength in amino acids.  Now looking ahead, we expect nutrition to continue to grow operating profits at a 15%-plus rate for calendar year 2022 with the first quarter similar to the first quarter of 2021, with continued revenue growth offset by some higher costs upfront in the year and the absence of the one-time benefits we saw in the first quarter of the prior year.  Slide 9 please. Now let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment, as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were substantially higher, driven primarily by higher captive insurance underwriting results as the prior year quarter included larger intra-company insurance settlements. For calendar year 2022, we expect other business results to be similar to 2021, although for the first quarter we expect a loss of about $25 million due to insurance settlements currently planned. Net interest expense increased year over year on higher short term borrowings. In the corporate line, unallocated corporate costs of $276 million were lower year over year due primarily to increased variable performance related compensation expense accruals in the prior year, partially offset by higher IT operating and project-related costs and transfers of costs from business segments into centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations. We anticipate calendar year 2022 total corporate costs, including net interest, corporate unallocated, and other corporate to be in line with the $1.2 billion area, consistent with what I discussed at global investor day, with net interest roughly similar, corporate unallocated a bit higher, and corporate other a bit lower. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was approximately 21% compared to 8% in the prior year. The calendar year 2021 effective tax rate was approximately 17%, up from 5% in 2020. The increase for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in geographic mix of earnings and current year discrete tax items, primarily valuation allowance and return to provision adjustments. Looking ahead, we\u2019re expecting full year 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 19%. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 28% and available liquidity of about $9 billion.  With that, let me turn it back to Juan. Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you Ray. Slide 10 please.  I hope most of you were able to join us on our global investor day last month. There, we showed that we have consistently advanced our strategy, from our work to improve ROIC through capital cost and cash to our strategic growth and margin enhancement accomplishments, including the creation of a global nutrition business, to today\u2019s focus on productivity and innovation. Thanks to this work, we are moving into 2022 with a better ADM, a more returns-focused organization with higher margins and less volatile earnings, and a portfolio that is well positioned to capitalize on the positive structural changes being driven by the enduring global trends of food security, health and wellbeing, and sustainability. Slide 11 please. Let me take a few moments to talk about how we see the 2022 environment. In ag services and oilseeds, we see a continued favorable global demand environment. Due to a short drought in South America with the magnitude of the shortfall still to be determined, we expect global ag commodity buyers will rely relatively more on the U.S. market for their needs, assuming we have a normal U.S. crop later this year.  On the oilseeds side, we are starting 2022 with strong soy crush margins, and as we discussed at global investor day, we believe that increasing demand for meal as well as vegetable oil as a feedstock for renewable green diesel should continue to support the positive environment this year with our soy crush margins in the range of $45 to $55 per metric ton. Assuming these dynamics play out, we believe that ag services and oilseeds in 2022 has the potential to deliver an operating profit similar to or better than 2021. For carbohydrate solutions, we are assuming the demand and margin environment for our starch and sweetener products will be steady versus 2021. We expect the industry ethanol environment to continue to be constructive, supported by the recovery of domestic demand to pre-COVID levels, energy costs driving higher exports, and better clarity on the regulatory landscape. With this in mind, we are assuming higher ADM ethanol volumes and EBITDA margins to average $0.15 to $0.25 for the calendar year. In addition, we are expecting our value solutions platform to deliver another year of solid growth as we continue to evolve the carbohydrate solutions business. Putting it all together, we expect carbohydrate solutions to deliver full year operating profits slightly lower than the outstanding 2021.  In nutrition, we are expecting continued growth in demand for our unparalleled portfolio of nutrition ingredients and systems, along with the benefits of accretion from our recent acquisitions. With these dynamics, we expect 15%-plus OP growth in 2022, revenue growth above 10%, and EBITDA margins above 20% in human nutrition and high single digits in animal nutrition, consistent with targets we set out at our global investor day. Slide 12 please. As we look forward in 2022, we see a positive demand environment across our portfolio, and then we add to that things we can do better. Our execution was great in 2021, but we\u2019re always identifying opportunities for improvement and we intend to do even more to meet this growing demand in 2022. Put it all together and we\u2019re optimistic for another very strong performance in 2022 as we progress towards our strategic plan next earnings milestones of $6 to $7 per share.  With that, Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question on the phone lines comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Ben, please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Thank you very much, and good morning, Juan, Ray. Congrats on those very strong results. \nJuan Luciano: Thank you Ben.\nRay Young: Thank you Ben.\nBen Theurer: To start off, maybe just to stay a little bit within the outlook, clearly you continue to have a very positive view on the segment side, but could you also share a little bit your assumptions in terms of CapEx needs and where you\u2019re seeing investment needs to be put into in order to deliver on the actual supply of these, so a little bit of your CapEx program and how you feel about that then ultimately the results flowing down to net income and what your expectations are for 2022?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, so many questions wrapped in one, Ben - good job. On the CapEx perspective, as you look at our strategic plan, most of our strategic plan is coming from organic growth and productivity, so in order to fund that, we\u2019re going to have a little bit higher CapEx this year of about $1.3 billion. That will be of course in some of the projects we need to do to expand, like Spiritwood that we announced our JV with Marathon, but also again some productivity enhancements to make sure we deliver bigger volumes as we supply that demand. As you know, we are facing 2022 with a very strong perspective for the first quarter. We are entering the year with great momentum as we left 2021 also in a big high, so at this point in time, we continue to see a very strong 2022, and I think I described it in all of my commentary, ag services and oilseeds continue to firing on all cylinders and we expect a year as good as last year, or maybe even better. Carb solutions also going very strong with many--with very stable start and sweeteners, and you know, with always some uncertainty on ethanol but with a favorable environment, and [indiscernible] solutions continued to grow as we grew last year, and again nutrition going up about 15% per year operating profit growth on double-digit revenue growth.  All in all, we feel very good about all the things that we can control.\nBen Theurer: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Then just one last question, just a quick one. If you think about your medium term targets, and I remember you\u2019ve laid out obviously as well the initiatives for share buybacks, etc., but in light of the higher CapEx plus the increase in dividends, fair to assume that share buybacks, at least in the short term, aren\u2019t going to be a priority yet, correct?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I think the priority for capital allocation is to de-leverage after we had maybe a couple of billion dollars invested in acquisitions, certainly fund the projects that we have in higher CapEx, as I described, and then the dividend, to support the dividend. Of course, cash flow generation is strong in ADM, you know we focus a lot on that, so as cash flow becomes available, we\u2019re going to think again in the five-year plan to have more buybacks in the later period, but if cash flow continues to be as strong, we may anticipate that a little bit. At this point in time, we don\u2019t expect significant M&A as part of our plans, so that would be the capital allocation decision.\nBen Theurer: Perfect Juan, very clear. Thank you very much, and congrats again.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you Ben.\nOperator: Thank you Ben. We now have the next question from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Ben, please go ahead, your line is open.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey, thanks. Good morning and congrats on the strong quarter. \nRay Young: Thank you Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: I wanted to follow up on the outlook commentary, which was really helpful and detailed. Of particular interest to us is the bio product commentary that you offered. I think within the carbohydrate solutions business, the commentary around starches and sweeteners makes sense. The bio products obviously benefited from a very strong fourth quarter, and I suspect perhaps you had an opportunity to secure margins into the first quarter, but the commentary is pretty positive through the balance of the year, and I realize higher production will help in benefiting operating profit for that business. Can you talk a little bit about what informs your view for the strength of the ethanol business sustaining into 2022? \nRay Young: Hey Ben, good morning. It\u2019s Ray here.  Yes, we finished up very strong in the bio products business, ethanol specifically. The fourth quarter demand environment was very, very constructive, and I think that\u2019s just reflective of what was happening in terms of the recovery in driving miles in United States, the holiday season. Gasoline demand was strong, that translates to strong demand for ethanol. On the supply side, actually the industry had some supply challenges, and so that translated to a very robust environment; in fact, our EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter for our ethanol business were above a dollar a gallon, which is very, very--you know, on a historical basis is very, very strong.  We indicated that as we go into 2022, we feel optimistic about ethanol as well. While inventories have built up a little bit in January, and that\u2019s just the seasonal nature of ethanol--of inventory builds, a couple things give us optimism for 2022. Number one, we do expect domestic demand for ethanol to be strong; in fact, it will be a growth year-over-year from \u201921 to \u201922, and frankly we\u2019re seeing ethanol demand probably returning back to pre-pandemic levels of demand here in the United States, so we\u2019re talking about domestic demand probably in the 14 billion gallon level.  Secondly, I think you\u2019re going to see a recovery around the world on gasoline demand and hence ethanol demand as well, and as you know, with the movement in crude oil prices in general, ethanol is becoming one of the most attractive oxygenates in the world, so we do see the export demand side of the equation in 2022 being also very constructive for ethanol, with ethanol probably recovering to 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion gallons in terms of export demand, so that\u2019s very, very constructive. Thirdly, we do believe that the regulatory landscape has clarified itself in the context of small refinery exemptions. I know there\u2019s some challenges going on here, but what we see right now is going forward, smaller SREs, as they call it, small refinery exemptions will not have an impact in terms of the supply-demand balances, and we talk internally that when they say 15 billion gallons, it means 15 billion gallons in terms of what we need to deliver to the marketplace, so that\u2019s actually a positive also for our industry, and then they\u2019ve also remanded about 250 million gallons in terms of requirements as well going forward. When you add it all together, the fact that we\u2019re starting off the year with a fairly balanced supply-demand perspective in terms of U.S. ethanol inventories; two, a demand environment that\u2019s going to be even more constructive versus 2021; and three, a regulatory environment that seems to be supportive of where we want to go, we actually have a constructive viewpoint. As Juan indicated, directionally we\u2019re assuming $0.15 to $0.25 per gallon as EBITDA margins for 2022 - that\u2019s lower than the \u201921 assumption, and maybe we\u2019re just being a little bit conservative at this juncture as we start off the year, but nevertheless we do believe it should be a favorable environment for us as we move forward into 2022.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, that\u2019s great. Very helpful Ray, thank you. My second question is just related to the global operating environment, and in particular some of the goings on in Ukraine at the moment and tensions there. Is that--how is that manifesting itself today in terms of the impact to your business? I know from an asset footprint perspective, you guys don\u2019t have super-heavy exposure there, but they\u2019re a major producer of rapeseed, corn, wheat, barley, so I\u2019m curious what impact you\u2019re seeing in the market today and how you think about the potential impact as we look into 2022, recognizing a lot of different scenarios could play out there.\nJuan Luciano: Yes Ben, of course you realize the supply of many commodities remains at their tightest levels in years, so I think any news around the world of disruption, whether it\u2019s weather or geopolitics is going to prolong the high prices well into, probably, 2023. As you described, at this point in time there are three things. We are all looking at the development of the crops in South America as they need to go through February rains, especially in Argentina and the harvest in Brazil. We are looking of course at geopolitical conflicts like the one you described, and also the expectations of the crop in the U.S., all this in the middle of a very strong demand.  As you said, Ukraine is a big exporter, especially if you think about corn and the ability to supply China\u2019s needs. You have the three main suppliers, whether it\u2019s the U.S. and you have Ukraine and you have Brazil, so hopefully Brazil with these rains will have a safrinha crop that is maybe a little bit better than what we expect, but among these three countries need to cover the supply of corn, and corn today is one of the best sources of energy and fat out there, one of the cheapest ones, so it\u2019s a very demanded product, so we\u2019re all paying attention to what happens [indiscernible].\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, thank you Juan. Congrats on the quarter, and best of luck into 2022.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you Ben. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have another question on the phone lines from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam, please go ahead when you\u2019re ready.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you, and good morning everyone. \nRay Young: Morning Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: I guess my first question is I want to come back to the outlook in carbohydrate solutions and just make sure I\u2019m understanding the moving pieces to think about a full year 2022 outlook that\u2019s only slightly below 2021, where both your \u201922--\u201921 performance was above what you would have expected and 2025 for the unit, and just trying to think about the moving pieces with ethanol, and maybe there\u2019s a clarification point on the--when you talk about ethanol margin $0.15 to $0.25 a gallon EBITDA, is that purely the dry mill gallons within Vantage corn processors or is that including the wet mill, and I guess in that vein, in the fourth quarter, given the strong ethanol margin environment, I guess I was surprised just to have seen the starches and sweeteners business be down, if that should have also been benefiting from a strong U.S. ethanol environment, so maybe just help us think about some of the bridges of the pieces within the segment to get you to the \u201922 outlook.\nRay Young: Yes Adam, it\u2019s Ray here, so $0.15 to $0.25 EBITDA margin represents total ethanol, wet mill and dry mill, so that\u2019s a combined basis on that assumption. In the fourth quarter, we had, as you saw, an outstanding quarter. VCP really benefited from the ethanol margins, and clearly starches and sweeteners also benefited as well on the ethanol side of the business. Our net corn cost was a little bit higher in the fourth quarter for starches and sweeteners, and recall when we hedged 2021 for corn, we put on a very attractive hedge position in 2020 for a lot of our 2021 requirements, but not all the requirements, so when we got to the fourth quarter, I think we were a little bit more exposed on net corn, so therefore the higher net corn cost translates to maybe a little bit lower margin on the sweetener side of the business there. We also had some operating challenges with the start-up of Bulgaria in Europe, which again is an opportunity, frankly speaking, for us in 2022, right, and we also had some higher energy costs over in Europe as well. As you know, natural gas prices ran up significantly in the back part of the year, so that impacted our energy costs over in Europe and that flowed through in terms of our starches and sweeteners segment.  There were a bunch of puts and takes that moved through the fourth quarter. Again, we think a lot of that will be behind us because I think we\u2019ve put ourselves--you know, put in a good hedge position for 2022, and then also we believe that we\u2019ve got the Bulgarian project, we\u2019ve addressed a lot of those issues, and that should be a plus delta for us in 2022 as well.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay, that color is really helpful. If I could just switch gears over to the nutrition segment, and maybe help us think a little bit about the expectations for the business on an organic basis in 2022. I know there was a--you did some M&A through the second half of 2021, so you talked to 10%-plus revenue growth and 15%-plus profit growth. Can you help us think about the M&A contributions within that, and any specific parts of the business that you might be more optimistic than the segment average, and areas where the growth might be a little bit below that?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, so I think most of 2022 will be on an organic growth basis, if you will. The contribution still of the acquisitions is going to happen a little bit later. These acquisitions are not made, to be honest, for the accretion of 2022. As you recall, we are just building the nutrition business, so this is the strategic importance of positioning ourselves in the areas where we\u2019ve been informing you. I think that we always like to have the policy of no surprises, and I think you heard me saying health and wellness is an area where we were going to invest, and that\u2019s why we did Deerland pet food, and that\u2019s why we did PetDine. We continue to think about the incredible potential of plant-based proteins, and that\u2019s why we did soy protein which is making us more international. I talked about how powerful we are in flavors, but we were under-represented, if you will, in the emerging markets, and that\u2019s why we invested in capacity in Pinghu for flavors in China, and we also acquired Fisa that gives us a beachhead into Central America, Caribbean, and maybe the northern part of Latin America.  When we look at the business, our confidence in the 15%-plus organic operating profit growth is given by our pipeline and our win rates, to be honest, that\u2019s why we look. Our pipeline continues to increase, our product launches continue to increase and actually accelerate, and our win rates have almost doubled from one year to the other, so the business is operating very well. We guided flat for Q1 just because of the way some of the costs fall, and they are more front-loaded into next year, but this is a business again that\u2019s been growing 34%, 20%, I think we\u2019re going to stabilize in the long term at this rate of 15%, 15%-plus with double digit organic growth, basically, without even touching the M&A for that growth.\nAdam Samuelson: Got it. That\u2019s all really helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on, thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert, I\u2019ve opened your line.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question, and congrats on a great year. \nRay Young: Thanks Robert.\nRobert Moskow: Of course. Maybe you\u2019ve kind of implied this already, but your pricing for corn sweeteners in 2022, can you describe how the negotiations went, and it looks like what you\u2019re guiding to was kind of flattish profits in North America for corn sweeteners as a result of that pricing. Is that a fair assessment?\nRay Young: Yes Rob, our objective is really to maintain margins, and so through the course of the negotiations, I think it\u2019s fair to make an assumption that we\u2019ve been able to maintain margins and offset the higher corn costs that has occurred recently. I think we\u2019ve achieved that objective, and that\u2019s a fair assumption to assume as we go into 2022.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, and maybe a follow-up, if expansion of refined soybean oil is driven by the growing demand of renewal biodiesel, have you been watching the industry--the planned industry expansion for all those refineries, and what kind of--is it achieving what you\u2019d expect? Is the capacity coming online as expected, and is it having the results on demand for oil that you would expect?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, of course we keep a close eye into that. You have to understand that at this point in time, demand continues to outpace even the announced capacity expansions, but there is a reality also in this world of supply shortages and labor issues, that projects are not that easy to execute. I think that when you look at a battery of announcements like the way we\u2019ve seen, I think it\u2019s reasonable to put a percentage that that is going to happen, either the reality or that they\u2019re all going to happen but in a little bit longer timeline. We tend to look at that from a long term basis of maybe something like two-thirds or 75% will happen. At this point in time, we see the volume coming our way, and you have to remember that the original oil story, Rob, it was due to high palm oil around the world, and that drove soybean and other oils up, and now on top of that, now we have the demand for RGD, so that--now, there is a full confluence of raw materials to be able to supply that oil. So yes, we are looking at this very closely, and at this point in time, everything is evolving as planned.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, all right. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you Robert. We now have Tom Palmer of JP Morgan. Tom, your line is open, please go ahead.\nTom Palmer: Good morning. Thank you for the questions, and congratulations on the quarter.\nRay Young: Thank you Tom.\nTom Palmer: Maybe I can follow up on Rob\u2019s question, just on the refined products outlook, and maybe a little more specific on how you\u2019re thinking about the set-up for 2022. We do have maybe the first larger wave of facilities coming online with pre-treatment units, although that is at least back half-weighted, I think, so maybe what\u2019s the assumption for refined products this year, and do you think that that addition in terms of capacity is going to have much impact, or as you were kind of noting with Rob, maybe just with timing and needs of still sourcing from, at least a portion from third parties, it won\u2019t be as impactful?\nJuan Luciano: Yes Tom, listen - we continue to believe we will add around a billion gallons per year of incremental RGD capacity and approach that 5 billion gallons total capacity by 2025. As I was telling Rob, we continually reframe the announced capacity and analyze the market conditions, so we have several scenarios in this. We do believe these announced capacities are important to and necessary to keep up with the expected demand growth for both vegetable oil, as I explained before, but also global meal demand needs. At this point, vegetable oil consumption is still growing faster than supply. We\u2019ve gotten a little bit of good news from Sanoil availability from black seed that maybe will help bean oil tightness, and--. So regarding the pre-treat comments, in the end the vegetable oil will be required as a feedstock and pricing will reflect the value of this feedstock, likely based on carbon intensity, so we could see some shift in value between the crude oil and the refining. I think what we need to realize is we are at the early stages of this industry formation, so we\u2019re going to see some of that movement and sometimes we\u2019re going to capture the value in one place, sometimes we\u2019re going to capture the value in another one. But we are well positioned, our biodiesel plants are all integrated in refineries and all that, so we are watching it very closely and we feel good about how it\u2019s developing so far.\nTom Palmer: Great, thank you for that. Maybe I\u2019ll segue with that to the crushing side. It seems like you\u2019re starting off the year with quite strong soy crush margins, perhaps higher than maybe you\u2019re guiding to for the year. Is there a, I guess, catalyst or driver that maybe makes margins weaker? Is there a bit of conservatism embedded? We see headlines around lysine shortage - is that something you\u2019re expecting to resolve itself and maybe see still a very favorable crush environment, but a little more normalized versus to start off the year?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, there are many--of course, this is a large industry, so many puts and takes. When we look at the demand side, the forecasted 2022 poultry production is going to be a record and near record for beef and hog, so protein demand continues to grow around the world, and that\u2019s sustaining a lot. There is a tight meat proteins and synthetic amino acids, and that\u2019s supporting soybean meal. Remember, I mentioned fat is very expensive today and energy as well, so corn at this point in time is the cheapest carbohydrate, that\u2019s pulling soybean meal into the Russian, and we expect that one point in time, the lysine market may be back into balance later in 2022. But still, the SMDs are very, very beneficial to soybean meal and to crush, so. I think also, don\u2019t forget RGD is also changing the dynamics for soybean meal, making soybean meal from the U.S. much more competitive and able to gain some export markets, and when you have maybe a less than stellar soybean crop in Argentina, Argentina being such a strong exporter of meal, I think that bodes well for crush margins in North America and also in Europe.\nTom Palmer: Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you Tom.\nOperator: We now have the next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent, please ensure your line is unmuted locally, and you may go ahead.\nSteve Haynes: Hi, this is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Wanted to ask a question on the bio solutions business and the $100 million of annualized revenue wins in 2021, and if you could maybe just provide some more color on specific end markets where you\u2019re getting those wins and then how to think about the size of that going forward.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, thank you for the question, Steve. Listen, we are very excited about how that business is developing. I think we recognized in the past that that business happened almost while we were not watching and it was a customer pull more than our push. Now, we have a segment approach to that. We have intentionality in developing that market and as such, the opportunities have flourished. I would say a strong contribution from packaging, a strong contribution from fermentation - you know, we\u2019re helping other people that are creating some of these materials out of a plant base, personal and homecare, a very important segment that is growing, and a growing contribution from pharma, construction and plant treatment. So as you can tell, as we continue to deploy marketing resources into some of these segments, we continue to have success. There are some segments that are more developed and larger for us and some segments that are more incipient, but I think it\u2019s going very well. We are working on the product mix as sometimes the growth is faster than our capacity, so we\u2019re trying to accommodate that and we\u2019re going to be having more capacity coming up soon to be able to sustain this 10% growth rate [indiscernible] that we have.\nSteve Haynes: Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you Vincent. We now have Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Ken, please go ahead when you\u2019re ready.\nKen Zaslow: Hi, good morning everyone. \nJuan Luciano: Morning Ken.\nRay Young: Hey Ken.\nKen Zaslow: Let me just take a different approach. When you think about your--you talk about all the things that are happening on the demand side, but at your analyst day, you kind of did talk about the cost structure increasing and that there were going to be some headwinds. As I look forward, these headwinds don\u2019t seem to be materializing to the extent, or are they, and can you frame how you kind of put it during the analyst day and where you see they are going through to--you know, where you\u2019re seeing them now, where you see them through 2022, and are you really seeing them develop they way you thought they were or are they a little bit lower than you thought?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, the dynamics here, Ken, of course is we have forecasted or accounted for some--the potential reversion of margins and some inflation of course that we were going to have, and that is difficult to estimate the timing, and then we have productivity and innovation that is going to be growing in their impact as some of these projects develop. When we look at, if you will, at the negative side of the equation, as the positive side we can control, on the negative side we\u2019ve put together several scenarios, and I would say the biggest manifestation of that at this point in time has been energy inflation, and inflation from some smaller products. We suffer probably more of this, some supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, that you probably hear every company talking about.  I would say from an energy perspective, the impact is probably more on Europe, whether it\u2019s on crush or carb solutions, that\u2019s where we see the impact, and we have our team basically working on energy efficiency and shaving some percentages of that increase, and also our hedging mechanisms and all that. On the raw material side and the supply chain disruptions, that\u2019s probably more the territory of nutrition. Nutrition, as you can imagine, has more variety of raw materials and more SKUs, so the complexity of that business makes it more exposed to some of these winds. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at that - it\u2019s more the European energy increase and some of the nutrition one-offs here and there on supply chain.\nKen Zaslow: My second question is--and I appreciate that. On the China side, I think last call and the call before, you kind of outlined how demand is growing. I know 2021 was an extraordinary year for China demand. How do you think that\u2019s going to play out in 2022 and 2023 in terms of will there be a mix change, will there be increased demand? How do you kind of think about it relative to your business model? I appreciate your time, as always.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, thank you Ken. Listen, we think that China has recovered from the ASF, they recovered their herd. You saw the dynamics in terms of pork prices coming up and down. We still believe that they will import soybeans in the high 90s - you know, 96, 97 million give or take, and around probably 25 million tons of corn.  Again, when we are working the way they are managing through COVID challenges, but we expect demand will continue to grow, it continues to be supported by improved diets and professional feeding practices. Even if we see some moderation of GDP, we think that we\u2019ve seen per capita consumption of the top four meats basically increases, and even if they correct it a little bit, they correct versus 2021, they are still much bigger than pre-ASF and pre-pandemic.  We [indiscernible] with a number here or there, but still it\u2019s going to be very strong, and as I said, probably 96, 97 million of soybeans, 25 million of corn, that will provide a good base for the grain industry and the crushing industry.\nKen Zaslow: Great, I appreciate it. Thank you guys.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you Ken.\nOperator: Thank you Ken. We now have a question from Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben, please go ahead when you\u2019re ready.\nBen Kallo: Hi, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. Ray, you touched on the regulatory environment just in your ethanol comments, but maybe just on a broader level, maybe around renewable diesel, if you guys could talk about that. Then on the legislative front, I hate to ask because it\u2019s anyone\u2019s best guess, but how you see maybe the blender\u2019s tax credit and anything around aviation fuel evolving. Thank you.\nRay Young: Yes, on the biodiesel, as you know, the current blender\u2019s credit continues until the end of 2022 - December 31, 2022, so naturally we\u2019re looking at what\u2019s happening on the legislative agenda in Washington on the BBB program to see whether it gets renewed. But historically what you\u2019ve seen is, frankly, both parties are supportive of the biodiesel industry - it\u2019s important for the United States, and so even if something doesn\u2019t occur on BBB, we\u2019re optimistic that the blender\u2019s credit will get extended in one way or another through some form of legislation as we move through the year. If you recall, sometimes it happens after you get through the end of the year and then you have a retroactive biodiesel tax credit, which we\u2019ve seen in the past, so we actually feel confident that something will occur there in order to kind of continue with the blender\u2019s credit on the biodiesel tax credit. On the SAF front, as you know, this is something that we\u2019re working on right now with different partners. It is going to be an important part of the fuel industry in the future as we go green in terms of aviation fuel, so [indiscernible] frankly, again, the support we see in terms of the direction of SAF, we\u2019re optimistic that some form of legislative--yes, some form of legislative actions will be taken to support the sustainable aviation fuel, the SAF industry. Again, it\u2019s a nascent industry right now, right - very few gallons are being produced, but projections show that by 2030, there\u2019s going to be a need for about 4 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel in combination of United States and Europe, so it\u2019s a significant growth industry and probably there\u2019s going to be some level of support required in order to start up this industry here.\nBen Kallo: And back to the renewable diesel front, could you just talk about any areas that you\u2019re watching? We talked about the supply side and how you discount new production facilities coming online, but could you talk about the demand side and where you\u2019re seeing incremental demand coming from, the regions that we already know out there or new regions? Thank you, and thanks for all of the answers.\nRay Young: The demand side is really driven by the different states implementing low carbon fuel standards, LCFS standards, particularly starting out in the west, but frankly it gets extended across all of the United States and Canada. The demand side is there as all the states move towards LCFS standards, and frankly the industry is just simply trying to respond to that demand by building the supply to meet that particular requirement there.\nBen Kallo: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve, please go ahead, I have opened your line.\nSteve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Do you think that soybean oil will represent the majority of the feedstock for this 5 billion gallons of renewable diesel?\nRay Young: It\u2019s going to represent an important part of it. As demand grows for renewable green diesel, it\u2019s going to require the pull from many sorts of feedstocks, and in fact it\u2019s very likely that even canola oil will find a pathway eventually to become part of a feedstock for renewable green diesel. But we still believe that maybe about 45% of the production will come from soybean oil, eventually small production out of the canola oil that I referenced there, so it is going to be an important component because there\u2019s just insufficient amount of, let\u2019s say, used cooking oil and other types of feedstocks, fat and rendering. There\u2019s just not enough supply in order to meet this growing demand.\nSteve Byrne: Even your 45% is 30 million acres of incremental soybeans, which I don\u2019t think is going to happen. Does that mean soybean exports get squeezed out and instead it gets crushed, the oil goes into RD, and you export the meal?\nRay Young: We\u2019ve indicated we believe that a lot of the U.S. soybean oil exports will actually come down, you\u2019re correct. I think there is going to be a diversion away from exports of soybean oil. There will also be some diversion away from even food applications. There\u2019s going to be a daisy chain effect that goes on which, frankly, is actually supportive for the entire vegetable oil complex around the world. I think there is going to be some daisy chain effects that are going on in order to meet this type of demand.\nSteve Byrne: And then what about your Slide 15, where you show forward sales by farmers in South America being below historical averages? Do you attribute that to the uncertainty that they are seeing with their current crop, just from either drought or excessive rain, and if grain and oilseed production is lower there in 2022, or the rest of the world for that matter, is that a net benefit to you in trading?\nJuan Luciano: Steve, this is Juan. What you\u2019re seeing from the farmer in South America is reflective of both things. One is the current impact in South America, and the second is, as you see, they are looking at what happened with the size of the crop. In terms of whether it\u2019s beneficial for ADM or not, our role is to try to fulfill our mission of providing nutrition around the world, and that\u2019s where we use our supply chain to make sure that we deliver to our customers and we deliver to the populations around the world. Sometimes it coincides with margin expansion in some parts of the business, sometimes it may not. We like the fact that there is strong demand around the world, and that tends to be good for ADM, yes.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have our next question from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Michael, please go ahead.\nMichael Piken: Yes, good morning. Just wanted to sort of get your take on the current transportation system and the outlook it supports, both in New Orleans, are we fully recovered from the hurricanes, and then kind of the barge system and what\u2019s happening over in the ports in China. What\u2019s sort of the back-up, and is business flowing normally or how backed up is it?\nJuan Luciano: Yes Michael, good question. Let\u2019s talk about China. Some slight COVID-related challenges in China are impacting ports, but to be honest, the situation has improved. Initially we got the highlights, but in general the port situation continues to improve, and maybe we have average waiting about two, three days for bulk cargo in agriculture in most main ports, so I would say China is kind of okay. We\u2019ve seen line-ups or demurrage time increasing in Brazil. There are still boats exporting corn and importing fertilizers since the soybean crop is a little bit delayed. We are seeing more--we are seeing waiting times kind of double from maybe 15 days to 30 days in Brazil, and that\u2019s pushing some volume into North America for maybe March-April deliveries. North America export capacity has recovered for the most part. I think there is one plant that was going to have some long term or medium term, if you will, repairments, but for the most part, the export capacity has been recovered to pre-idle levels, at least for us. I would say in terms of the river, the Illinois River, there is a lot of freezing and there is a lot of icy conditions that have slowed down the river movement, and we see that, and that probably will continue.\nMichael Piken: Great, that\u2019s helpful. Then just as a follow-up, what\u2019s the elevation margin outlook as you guys see it for the year? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: We\u2019re seeing--as you know, we have the impact of Ida in Q4, we had the demand but we didn\u2019t have the ability to support to supply, so a lot of that volume was moved into Q1. We have seen the elevation margins increasing in Q1, so a little bit as expected, so we feel good about how to satisfy that demand.\nMichael Piken: Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Eric of Seaport Research Partners. Eric, please go ahead.\nEric Larson: Yes, thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in everybody. Congrats on a great quarter. Great year everyone. \nJuan Luciano: Thank you.\nEric Larson: I know this has kind of been beaten to death and obviously it\u2019s very important, so if you--it\u2019s again on the renewables. If you just take the renewable green diesel market, if you just look at the amount of feedstock that\u2019s required to kind of get to that 2025 goal, your goal of 5 billion gallons, it\u2019s--and I think it was alluded to earlier with that 45% comment, it\u2019s 30 million acres of increased--it\u2019s the equivalent of 30 million acres of soybean production, which it just isn\u2019t going to happen.  I know that Greg and Chris are all over this. Doesn\u2019t this--it\u2019s got to be--it is a global market, it will be. Doesn\u2019t this just feed right into your--into a very positive long term outlook for ag services that you\u2019re going to have to be able to pull globally a lot of resources in to meet these demand functions, but that\u2019s what makes it possible. Is that the way to look at this?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I think Eric, when you have one explosion in demand in one place of the world, resources from around the world will come, and as Ray was saying, maybe we\u2019re going to export less, certainly we may import more, and there are going to be shifts between the different products. I would say we continue to be in a world that requires more food and also that requires to help the environment. It has been a structural change in demand for us, and for a company that has assets around the world, that probably means better utilization of those assets and better value of those assets as we try to solve these issues.\nEric Larson: Good, well thanks. The final question I have, and a lot of those have been answered already, so when we look at the current year in terms of U.S. crop production, what are you hearing from your farmer clients? Obviously it looks like we\u2019re putting a bid in the corn markets today to get more corn production. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty with input costs and all the other stuff. What is your feel for how in this early--well, it\u2019s not so early anymore, it\u2019s getting close to the time, what is your feel on how the crop production outlook looks for this year, kind of by crop?\nJuan Luciano: We expect a strong U.S. planting. Of course, some of those decisions, as you said, it\u2019s getting the time to make those decisions, and a lot of people are looking at the South American weather. South American weather is very strange at the moment - there is very dry conditions in Parana or the south of Brazil, and maybe Argentina, and it was a little bit too wet in the north. Numbers in the north are coming strong in terms of yield for Brazil. I think that the recent rains have stopped the deterioration of the crop in Argentina and the south of Brazil, and probably with Paraguay having already felt the damage. We believe in the U.S. We still believe that probably corn will outpace soybeans in terms of acres, so we\u2019d probably think about, I don\u2019t know, something like 93 million acres of corn, 87 million acres of soybeans give or take. I understand the dynamics about fertilizers and all that, but I think even the prices of last year, I think that the prime land will probably maintain the same mix.\nEric Larson: Yes, I would agree with you. Thank you Juan, and again congratulations on a great year.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you. Thank you Eric.\nOperator: Thank you. I would like to hand it back to Vikram Luthar for some closing remarks.\nVikram Luthar: Thank you Rika.  Thank you for joining us today. Slide 13 notes upcoming investor events in which we will be participating. As always, please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a great day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining. That does conclude today\u2019s call. You may disconnect your lines and have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you Vikram. Our team delivered a superb fourth quarter. This morning, we reported record fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.50. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.4 billion, 23% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our trailing four quarter adjusted EBITDA was $4.9 billion, $1.25 billion more than a year ago, and our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 10%, meeting our objectives. Slide 4 please. That performance represented a strong finish to an astounding 2021. For the full year, our adjusted EPS was $5.19, also a record, and full year adjusted segment operating profit was $4.8 billion. This excellent performance was reflected across the company. [Indiscernible] its team's actions to improve their business portfolio and strengthen their operating model continues to enable superior performance in a strong market environment. AS&O delivered full year 2021 OP of $2.8 billion with each sub-segment performing at or near historic highs.  Carbohydrate solutions executed phenomenally well to deliver full year operating profits of $1.3 billion [indiscernible] from the sale of our Peoria grain dry mill and the announcement of the sustainable aviation fuel MoU through our agreement with [indiscernible] and the continuous growth of our exciting value solutions platform which delivered new revenue [indiscernible] with an annualized run rate of almost $100 billion, to the project we announced earlier this month to further decarbonize our operations by connecting two other major processing facilities to our Decatur carbon capture and storage capabilities. The nutrition team once again delivered industry-leading revenue and OP growth with full year revenues up 16% and full year OP of $691 million, representing a 20% year-over-year increase. We also continued to enhance our nutrition business with strategic investments targeted at growing areas of demand, including soy protein which will expand our participation in alternative proteins; PetDine, which substantially enhanced our presence in pet food and treats; Deerland, which continued the expansion of our functional probiotics and enzymes portfolio within our global health and wellness business; and FISA, which enhanced our flavor footprint by opening up new growth opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean. Slide 5 please. Last month at our global investor day, we unveiled our strategic plan and reiterated our balanced financial framework for value creation, including using our strong cash flows to deliver both growth investments and distributions to shareholders. We are confident in our plan and committee to continue to deliver value for our shareholders, which is why we are pleased to announce an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share.  We are proud of our record of 90 uninterrupted years of dividends and more than 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, and we are pleased to continue to follow through on our commitment to shareholder value creation.  It has been a great year and we are excited about what is to come. Our continuous actions to build a better ADM and dynamically align it with the global trends of food security, health and wellbeing and sustainability, and the steadfast advancement of our productivity and innovation initiatives will help propel our 2022 results.  I will talk in more detail about the upcoming calendar year shortly, but first I'd like to turn the call over to Ray to review our business performance. Ray? Thank you Ray. Slide 10 please.  I hope most of you were able to join us on our global investor day last month. There, we showed that we have consistently advanced our strategy, from our work to improve ROIC through capital cost and cash to our strategic growth and margin enhancement accomplishments, including the creation of a global nutrition business, to today's focus on productivity and innovation. Thanks to this work, we are moving into 2022 with a better ADM, a more returns-focused organization with higher margins and less volatile earnings, and a portfolio that is well positioned to capitalize on the positive structural changes being driven by the enduring global trends of food security, health and wellbeing, and sustainability. Slide 11 please. Let me take a few moments to talk about how we see the 2022 environment. In ag services and oilseeds, we see a continued favorable global demand environment. Due to a short drought in South America with the magnitude of the shortfall still to be determined, we expect global ag commodity buyers will rely relatively more on the U.S. market for their needs, assuming we have a normal U.S. crop later this year.  On the oilseeds side, we are starting 2022 with strong soy crush margins, and as we discussed at global investor day, we believe that increasing demand for meal as well as vegetable oil as a feedstock for renewable green diesel should continue to support the positive environment this year with our soy crush margins in the range of $45 to $55 per metric ton. Assuming these dynamics play out, we believe that ag services and oilseeds in 2022 has the potential to deliver an operating profit similar to or better than 2021. For carbohydrate solutions, we are assuming the demand and margin environment for our starch and sweetener products will be steady versus 2021. We expect the industry ethanol environment to continue to be constructive, supported by the recovery of domestic demand to pre-COVID levels, energy costs driving higher exports, and better clarity on the regulatory landscape. With this in mind, we are assuming higher ADM ethanol volumes and EBITDA margins to average $0.15 to $0.25 for the calendar year. In addition, we are expecting our value solutions platform to deliver another year of solid growth as we continue to evolve the carbohydrate solutions business. Putting it all together, we expect carbohydrate solutions to deliver full year operating profits slightly lower than the outstanding 2021.  In nutrition, we are expecting continued growth in demand for our unparalleled portfolio of nutrition ingredients and systems, along with the benefits of accretion from our recent acquisitions. With these dynamics, we expect 15%-plus OP growth in 2022, revenue growth above 10%, and EBITDA margins above 20% in human nutrition and high single digits in animal nutrition, consistent with targets we set out at our global investor day. Slide 12 please. As we look forward in 2022, we see a positive demand environment across our portfolio, and then we add to that things we can do better. Our execution was great in 2021, but we're always identifying opportunities for improvement and we intend to do even more to meet this growing demand in 2022. Put it all together and we're optimistic for another very strong performance in 2022 as we progress towards our strategic plan next earnings milestones of $6 to $7 per share.  With that, Operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you Ben. Yes, so many questions wrapped in one, Ben - good job. On the CapEx perspective, as you look at our strategic plan, most of our strategic plan is coming from organic growth and productivity, so in order to fund that, we're going to have a little bit higher CapEx this year of about $1.3 billion. That will be of course in some of the projects we need to do to expand, like Spiritwood that we announced our JV with Marathon, but also again some productivity enhancements to make sure we deliver bigger volumes as we supply that demand. As you know, we are facing 2022 with a very strong perspective for the first quarter. We are entering the year with great momentum as we left 2021 also in a big high, so at this point in time, we continue to see a very strong 2022, and I think I described it in all of my commentary, ag services and oilseeds continue to firing on all cylinders and we expect a year as good as last year, or maybe even better. Carb solutions also going very strong with many--with very stable start and sweeteners, and you know, with always some uncertainty on ethanol but with a favorable environment, and [indiscernible] solutions continued to grow as we grew last year, and again nutrition going up about 15% per year operating profit growth on double-digit revenue growth.  All in all, we feel very good about all the things that we can control. Yes, I think the priority for capital allocation is to de-leverage after we had maybe a couple of billion dollars invested in acquisitions, certainly fund the projects that we have in higher CapEx, as I described, and then the dividend, to support the dividend. Of course, cash flow generation is strong in ADM, you know we focus a lot on that, so as cash flow becomes available, we're going to think again in the five-year plan to have more buybacks in the later period, but if cash flow continues to be as strong, we may anticipate that a little bit. At this point in time, we don't expect significant M&A as part of our plans, so that would be the capital allocation decision. Thank you Ben. Yes Ben, of course you realize the supply of many commodities remains at their tightest levels in years, so I think any news around the world of disruption, whether it's weather or geopolitics is going to prolong the high prices well into, probably, 2023. As you described, at this point in time there are three things. We are all looking at the development of the crops in South America as they need to go through February rains, especially in Argentina and the harvest in Brazil. We are looking of course at geopolitical conflicts like the one you described, and also the expectations of the crop in the U.S., all this in the middle of a very strong demand.  As you said, Ukraine is a big exporter, especially if you think about corn and the ability to supply China's needs. You have the three main suppliers, whether it's the U.S. and you have Ukraine and you have Brazil, so hopefully Brazil with these rains will have a safrinha crop that is maybe a little bit better than what we expect, but among these three countries need to cover the supply of corn, and corn today is one of the best sources of energy and fat out there, one of the cheapest ones, so it's a very demanded product, so we're all paying attention to what happens [indiscernible]. Thank you Ben. Thank you very much. Yes, so I think most of 2022 will be on an organic growth basis, if you will. The contribution still of the acquisitions is going to happen a little bit later. These acquisitions are not made, to be honest, for the accretion of 2022. As you recall, we are just building the nutrition business, so this is the strategic importance of positioning ourselves in the areas where we've been informing you. I think that we always like to have the policy of no surprises, and I think you heard me saying health and wellness is an area where we were going to invest, and that's why we did Deerland pet food, and that's why we did PetDine. We continue to think about the incredible potential of plant-based proteins, and that's why we did soy protein which is making us more international. I talked about how powerful we are in flavors, but we were under-represented, if you will, in the emerging markets, and that's why we invested in capacity in Pinghu for flavors in China, and we also acquired Fisa that gives us a beachhead into Central America, Caribbean, and maybe the northern part of Latin America.  When we look at the business, our confidence in the 15%-plus organic operating profit growth is given by our pipeline and our win rates, to be honest, that's why we look. Our pipeline continues to increase, our product launches continue to increase and actually accelerate, and our win rates have almost doubled from one year to the other, so the business is operating very well. We guided flat for Q1 just because of the way some of the costs fall, and they are more front-loaded into next year, but this is a business again that's been growing 34%, 20%, I think we're going to stabilize in the long term at this rate of 15%, 15%-plus with double digit organic growth, basically, without even touching the M&A for that growth. Thank you Adam. Yes, of course we keep a close eye into that. You have to understand that at this point in time, demand continues to outpace even the announced capacity expansions, but there is a reality also in this world of supply shortages and labor issues, that projects are not that easy to execute. I think that when you look at a battery of announcements like the way we've seen, I think it's reasonable to put a percentage that that is going to happen, either the reality or that they're all going to happen but in a little bit longer timeline. We tend to look at that from a long term basis of maybe something like two-thirds or 75% will happen. At this point in time, we see the volume coming our way, and you have to remember that the original oil story, Rob, it was due to high palm oil around the world, and that drove soybean and other oils up, and now on top of that, now we have the demand for RGD, so that--now, there is a full confluence of raw materials to be able to supply that oil. So yes, we are looking at this very closely, and at this point in time, everything is evolving as planned. You're welcome. Yes Tom, listen - we continue to believe we will add around a billion gallons per year of incremental RGD capacity and approach that 5 billion gallons total capacity by 2025. As I was telling Rob, we continually reframe the announced capacity and analyze the market conditions, so we have several scenarios in this. We do believe these announced capacities are important to and necessary to keep up with the expected demand growth for both vegetable oil, as I explained before, but also global meal demand needs. At this point, vegetable oil consumption is still growing faster than supply. We've gotten a little bit of good news from Sanoil availability from black seed that maybe will help bean oil tightness, and--. So regarding the pre-treat comments, in the end the vegetable oil will be required as a feedstock and pricing will reflect the value of this feedstock, likely based on carbon intensity, so we could see some shift in value between the crude oil and the refining. I think what we need to realize is we are at the early stages of this industry formation, so we're going to see some of that movement and sometimes we're going to capture the value in one place, sometimes we're going to capture the value in another one. But we are well positioned, our biodiesel plants are all integrated in refineries and all that, so we are watching it very closely and we feel good about how it's developing so far. Yes, there are many--of course, this is a large industry, so many puts and takes. When we look at the demand side, the forecasted 2022 poultry production is going to be a record and near record for beef and hog, so protein demand continues to grow around the world, and that's sustaining a lot. There is a tight meat proteins and synthetic amino acids, and that's supporting soybean meal. Remember, I mentioned fat is very expensive today and energy as well, so corn at this point in time is the cheapest carbohydrate, that's pulling soybean meal into the Russian, and we expect that one point in time, the lysine market may be back into balance later in 2022. But still, the SMDs are very, very beneficial to soybean meal and to crush, so. I think also, don't forget RGD is also changing the dynamics for soybean meal, making soybean meal from the U.S. much more competitive and able to gain some export markets, and when you have maybe a less than stellar soybean crop in Argentina, Argentina being such a strong exporter of meal, I think that bodes well for crush margins in North America and also in Europe. Thank you Tom. Yes, thank you for the question, Steve. Listen, we are very excited about how that business is developing. I think we recognized in the past that that business happened almost while we were not watching and it was a customer pull more than our push. Now, we have a segment approach to that. We have intentionality in developing that market and as such, the opportunities have flourished. I would say a strong contribution from packaging, a strong contribution from fermentation - you know, we're helping other people that are creating some of these materials out of a plant base, personal and homecare, a very important segment that is growing, and a growing contribution from pharma, construction and plant treatment. So as you can tell, as we continue to deploy marketing resources into some of these segments, we continue to have success. There are some segments that are more developed and larger for us and some segments that are more incipient, but I think it's going very well. We are working on the product mix as sometimes the growth is faster than our capacity, so we're trying to accommodate that and we're going to be having more capacity coming up soon to be able to sustain this 10% growth rate [indiscernible] that we have. You're welcome. Morning Ken. Yes, the dynamics here, Ken, of course is we have forecasted or accounted for some--the potential reversion of margins and some inflation of course that we were going to have, and that is difficult to estimate the timing, and then we have productivity and innovation that is going to be growing in their impact as some of these projects develop. When we look at, if you will, at the negative side of the equation, as the positive side we can control, on the negative side we've put together several scenarios, and I would say the biggest manifestation of that at this point in time has been energy inflation, and inflation from some smaller products. We suffer probably more of this, some supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, that you probably hear every company talking about.  I would say from an energy perspective, the impact is probably more on Europe, whether it's on crush or carb solutions, that's where we see the impact, and we have our team basically working on energy efficiency and shaving some percentages of that increase, and also our hedging mechanisms and all that. On the raw material side and the supply chain disruptions, that's probably more the territory of nutrition. Nutrition, as you can imagine, has more variety of raw materials and more SKUs, so the complexity of that business makes it more exposed to some of these winds. That's the way we're looking at that - it's more the European energy increase and some of the nutrition one-offs here and there on supply chain. Yes, thank you Ken. Listen, we think that China has recovered from the ASF, they recovered their herd. You saw the dynamics in terms of pork prices coming up and down. We still believe that they will import soybeans in the high 90s - you know, 96, 97 million give or take, and around probably 25 million tons of corn.  Again, when we are working the way they are managing through COVID challenges, but we expect demand will continue to grow, it continues to be supported by improved diets and professional feeding practices. Even if we see some moderation of GDP, we think that we've seen per capita consumption of the top four meats basically increases, and even if they correct it a little bit, they correct versus 2021, they are still much bigger than pre-ASF and pre-pandemic.  We [indiscernible] with a number here or there, but still it's going to be very strong, and as I said, probably 96, 97 million of soybeans, 25 million of corn, that will provide a good base for the grain industry and the crushing industry. Thank you Ken. Steve, this is Juan. What you're seeing from the farmer in South America is reflective of both things. One is the current impact in South America, and the second is, as you see, they are looking at what happened with the size of the crop. In terms of whether it's beneficial for ADM or not, our role is to try to fulfill our mission of providing nutrition around the world, and that's where we use our supply chain to make sure that we deliver to our customers and we deliver to the populations around the world. Sometimes it coincides with margin expansion in some parts of the business, sometimes it may not. We like the fact that there is strong demand around the world, and that tends to be good for ADM, yes. You're welcome. Yes Michael, good question. Let's talk about China. Some slight COVID-related challenges in China are impacting ports, but to be honest, the situation has improved. Initially we got the highlights, but in general the port situation continues to improve, and maybe we have average waiting about two, three days for bulk cargo in agriculture in most main ports, so I would say China is kind of okay. We've seen line-ups or demurrage time increasing in Brazil. There are still boats exporting corn and importing fertilizers since the soybean crop is a little bit delayed. We are seeing more--we are seeing waiting times kind of double from maybe 15 days to 30 days in Brazil, and that's pushing some volume into North America for maybe March-April deliveries. North America export capacity has recovered for the most part. I think there is one plant that was going to have some long term or medium term, if you will, repairments, but for the most part, the export capacity has been recovered to pre-idle levels, at least for us. I would say in terms of the river, the Illinois River, there is a lot of freezing and there is a lot of icy conditions that have slowed down the river movement, and we see that, and that probably will continue. We're seeing--as you know, we have the impact of Ida in Q4, we had the demand but we didn't have the ability to support to supply, so a lot of that volume was moved into Q1. We have seen the elevation margins increasing in Q1, so a little bit as expected, so we feel good about how to satisfy that demand. You're welcome. Thank you. Yes, I think Eric, when you have one explosion in demand in one place of the world, resources from around the world will come, and as Ray was saying, maybe we're going to export less, certainly we may import more, and there are going to be shifts between the different products. I would say we continue to be in a world that requires more food and also that requires to help the environment. It has been a structural change in demand for us, and for a company that has assets around the world, that probably means better utilization of those assets and better value of those assets as we try to solve these issues. We expect a strong U.S. planting. Of course, some of those decisions, as you said, it's getting the time to make those decisions, and a lot of people are looking at the South American weather. South American weather is very strange at the moment - there is very dry conditions in Parana or the south of Brazil, and maybe Argentina, and it was a little bit too wet in the north. Numbers in the north are coming strong in terms of yield for Brazil. I think that the recent rains have stopped the deterioration of the crop in Argentina and the south of Brazil, and probably with Paraguay having already felt the damage. We believe in the U.S. We still believe that probably corn will outpace soybeans in terms of acres, so we'd probably think about, I don't know, something like 93 million acres of corn, 87 million acres of soybeans give or take. I understand the dynamics about fertilizers and all that, but I think even the prices of last year, I think that the prime land will probably maintain the same mix. Thank you. Thank you Eric."

            "name": "Ray Young",
            "content": "Yes, thanks Juan. Good morning and good afternoon everyone.  Slide 6 please. The ag services and oilseeds team capped off really a truly impressive year, successfully navigating through supply chain challenges to deliver results largely in line with the extremely strong prior year quarter. The ag services team performed well in an environment of continued strong global demand, including significantly increased export volumes for customers outside of China. Global trade was substantially higher year over year, driven by solid risk management and improved results in global ocean freight. Overall, ag services delivered strong results just slightly off the outstanding fourth quarter of 2020, when we benefited from exceptionally high export margins. Crushing executed well in a continued solid demand environment for both soybean meal and vegetable oil. Lower results in EMEA versus a very strong fourth quarter of 2020 and approximately $250 million in net negative timing impacts versus negative $125 million in the prior year quarter drove overall results lower year over year. The majority of those negative timing effects are expected to reverse in the first half of 2022.  The refined products and other team delivered substantially higher results versus the prior year period, driven by strong volumes and margins in North America for refined oils and improved biodiesel margins in North American and EMEA, which more than offset weaker South American results due to the reduced biodiesel mandate. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher year over year. Looking ahead, we expect a strong first quarter from ag services and oilseeds, higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with the just ended fourth quarter.  Slide 7 please. Carbohydrate solutions fourth quarter results were more than double the prior year quarter. In starches and sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, results were lower versus the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by higher input costs, including energy costs in EMEA as well as lower wheat milling volumes, partially offset by continued strong ethanol margins. Volumes for North American sweeteners and starches were largely flat year over year. Vantage corn processor results were again substantially higher year over year, driven by historically strong industry ethanol margins as a result of strong demand relative to supply, as well as increased sales volumes due to production at the two dry mills that were idle in the previous year period. As we look ahead, we believe the first quarter for carbohydrate solutions should be similar to or slightly above the strong first quarter of 2021. Slide 8 please. The nutrition business closed out a year of consistent and strong growth with fourth quarter revenues 19% higher year over year, 21% on a constant currency basis with 26% higher profits year over year and sustained strong EBITDA margins. Human nutrition had a great fourth quarter with revenue growth of 21% on a constant currency basis and substantially higher profits. Flavors continued its growth trajectory driven primarily by improved product mix in EMEA and continued strong performance from North America, partially offset by weaker APAC results.  In specialty ingredients, overall profits for the fourth quarter were in line with the year ago period as strong demand for plant-based proteins offset the impact of one-time insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020. Health and wellness was higher versus the prior year quarter as the business continued to deliver growing profits in bioactives and fermentation. Animal nutrition revenue was up 21% on a constant currency basis and operating profit was much higher year over year, driven primarily by continued strength in amino acids.  Now looking ahead, we expect nutrition to continue to grow operating profits at a 15%-plus rate for calendar year 2022 with the first quarter similar to the first quarter of 2021, with continued revenue growth offset by some higher costs upfront in the year and the absence of the one-time benefits we saw in the first quarter of the prior year.  Slide 9 please. Now let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment, as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were substantially higher, driven primarily by higher captive insurance underwriting results as the prior year quarter included larger intra-company insurance settlements. For calendar year 2022, we expect other business results to be similar to 2021, although for the first quarter we expect a loss of about $25 million due to insurance settlements currently planned. Net interest expense increased year over year on higher short term borrowings. In the corporate line, unallocated corporate costs of $276 million were lower year over year due primarily to increased variable performance related compensation expense accruals in the prior year, partially offset by higher IT operating and project-related costs and transfers of costs from business segments into centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations. We anticipate calendar year 2022 total corporate costs, including net interest, corporate unallocated, and other corporate to be in line with the $1.2 billion area, consistent with what I discussed at global investor day, with net interest roughly similar, corporate unallocated a bit higher, and corporate other a bit lower. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was approximately 21% compared to 8% in the prior year. The calendar year 2021 effective tax rate was approximately 17%, up from 5% in 2020. The increase for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in geographic mix of earnings and current year discrete tax items, primarily valuation allowance and return to provision adjustments. Looking ahead, we're expecting full year 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 19%. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 28% and available liquidity of about $9 billion.  With that, let me turn it back to Juan. Juan? Thank you Ben. Thank you Ben. Hey Ben, good morning. It's Ray here.  Yes, we finished up very strong in the bio products business, ethanol specifically. The fourth quarter demand environment was very, very constructive, and I think that's just reflective of what was happening in terms of the recovery in driving miles in United States, the holiday season. Gasoline demand was strong, that translates to strong demand for ethanol. On the supply side, actually the industry had some supply challenges, and so that translated to a very robust environment; in fact, our EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter for our ethanol business were above a dollar a gallon, which is very, very--you know, on a historical basis is very, very strong.  We indicated that as we go into 2022, we feel optimistic about ethanol as well. While inventories have built up a little bit in January, and that's just the seasonal nature of ethanol--of inventory builds, a couple things give us optimism for 2022. Number one, we do expect domestic demand for ethanol to be strong; in fact, it will be a growth year-over-year from '21 to '22, and frankly we're seeing ethanol demand probably returning back to pre-pandemic levels of demand here in the United States, so we're talking about domestic demand probably in the 14 billion gallon level.  Secondly, I think you're going to see a recovery around the world on gasoline demand and hence ethanol demand as well, and as you know, with the movement in crude oil prices in general, ethanol is becoming one of the most attractive oxygenates in the world, so we do see the export demand side of the equation in 2022 being also very constructive for ethanol, with ethanol probably recovering to 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion gallons in terms of export demand, so that's very, very constructive. Thirdly, we do believe that the regulatory landscape has clarified itself in the context of small refinery exemptions. I know there's some challenges going on here, but what we see right now is going forward, smaller SREs, as they call it, small refinery exemptions will not have an impact in terms of the supply-demand balances, and we talk internally that when they say 15 billion gallons, it means 15 billion gallons in terms of what we need to deliver to the marketplace, so that's actually a positive also for our industry, and then they've also remanded about 250 million gallons in terms of requirements as well going forward. When you add it all together, the fact that we're starting off the year with a fairly balanced supply-demand perspective in terms of U.S. ethanol inventories; two, a demand environment that's going to be even more constructive versus 2021; and three, a regulatory environment that seems to be supportive of where we want to go, we actually have a constructive viewpoint. As Juan indicated, directionally we're assuming $0.15 to $0.25 per gallon as EBITDA margins for 2022 - that's lower than the '21 assumption, and maybe we're just being a little bit conservative at this juncture as we start off the year, but nevertheless we do believe it should be a favorable environment for us as we move forward into 2022. Morning Adam. Yes Adam, it's Ray here, so $0.15 to $0.25 EBITDA margin represents total ethanol, wet mill and dry mill, so that's a combined basis on that assumption. In the fourth quarter, we had, as you saw, an outstanding quarter. VCP really benefited from the ethanol margins, and clearly starches and sweeteners also benefited as well on the ethanol side of the business. Our net corn cost was a little bit higher in the fourth quarter for starches and sweeteners, and recall when we hedged 2021 for corn, we put on a very attractive hedge position in 2020 for a lot of our 2021 requirements, but not all the requirements, so when we got to the fourth quarter, I think we were a little bit more exposed on net corn, so therefore the higher net corn cost translates to maybe a little bit lower margin on the sweetener side of the business there. We also had some operating challenges with the start-up of Bulgaria in Europe, which again is an opportunity, frankly speaking, for us in 2022, right, and we also had some higher energy costs over in Europe as well. As you know, natural gas prices ran up significantly in the back part of the year, so that impacted our energy costs over in Europe and that flowed through in terms of our starches and sweeteners segment.  There were a bunch of puts and takes that moved through the fourth quarter. Again, we think a lot of that will be behind us because I think we've put ourselves--you know, put in a good hedge position for 2022, and then also we believe that we've got the Bulgarian project, we've addressed a lot of those issues, and that should be a plus delta for us in 2022 as well. Thanks Robert. Yes Rob, our objective is really to maintain margins, and so through the course of the negotiations, I think it's fair to make an assumption that we've been able to maintain margins and offset the higher corn costs that has occurred recently. I think we've achieved that objective, and that's a fair assumption to assume as we go into 2022. Thank you Tom. Hey Ken. Yes, on the biodiesel, as you know, the current blender's credit continues until the end of 2022 - December 31, 2022, so naturally we're looking at what's happening on the legislative agenda in Washington on the BBB program to see whether it gets renewed. But historically what you've seen is, frankly, both parties are supportive of the biodiesel industry - it's important for the United States, and so even if something doesn't occur on BBB, we're optimistic that the blender's credit will get extended in one way or another through some form of legislation as we move through the year. If you recall, sometimes it happens after you get through the end of the year and then you have a retroactive biodiesel tax credit, which we've seen in the past, so we actually feel confident that something will occur there in order to kind of continue with the blender's credit on the biodiesel tax credit. On the SAF front, as you know, this is something that we're working on right now with different partners. It is going to be an important part of the fuel industry in the future as we go green in terms of aviation fuel, so [indiscernible] frankly, again, the support we see in terms of the direction of SAF, we're optimistic that some form of legislative--yes, some form of legislative actions will be taken to support the sustainable aviation fuel, the SAF industry. Again, it's a nascent industry right now, right - very few gallons are being produced, but projections show that by 2030, there's going to be a need for about 4 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel in combination of United States and Europe, so it's a significant growth industry and probably there's going to be some level of support required in order to start up this industry here. The demand side is really driven by the different states implementing low carbon fuel standards, LCFS standards, particularly starting out in the west, but frankly it gets extended across all of the United States and Canada. The demand side is there as all the states move towards LCFS standards, and frankly the industry is just simply trying to respond to that demand by building the supply to meet that particular requirement there. It's going to represent an important part of it. As demand grows for renewable green diesel, it's going to require the pull from many sorts of feedstocks, and in fact it's very likely that even canola oil will find a pathway eventually to become part of a feedstock for renewable green diesel. But we still believe that maybe about 45% of the production will come from soybean oil, eventually small production out of the canola oil that I referenced there, so it is going to be an important component because there's just insufficient amount of, let's say, used cooking oil and other types of feedstocks, fat and rendering. There's just not enough supply in order to meet this growing demand. We've indicated we believe that a lot of the U.S. soybean oil exports will actually come down, you're correct. I think there is going to be a diversion away from exports of soybean oil. There will also be some diversion away from even food applications. There's going to be a daisy chain effect that goes on which, frankly, is actually supportive for the entire vegetable oil complex around the world. I think there is going to be some daisy chain effects that are going on in order to meet this type of demand."

This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, but it's a 9% year-over-year improvement despite a higher tax rate. And our year-to-date adjusted EPS of $3.69 is already above our full-year 2020 adjusted EPS. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1 billion, up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020. And our 8th consecutive quarter of year-over-year OP growth. Our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.6 billion, almost a billion more than a year ago. And our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.6%, significantly higher versus the year-ago period. I remain proud to lead a global team that is delivering robust returns and sustained growth in profits. Our strong quarter and our ongoing upward trajectory are a testament to our team's execution and agility, and the consistent implementation of our strategic plan. I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter. Slide 4, please. I'd like to start by talking about our approach to portfolio management. Our starting point if they believe that in order to thrive and create value, a Company needs to have a dynamic view of its business portfolio. So when we talked about the dramatic transformation of our portfolio over the last 10 years, it's not a discrete event, it's a representation of our continuous work to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. Of course, those opportunities may be the -- must be the right ones. The enduring trends of food security, health, and well-being, and sustainability, provide unique and stable opportunities for ADM to expand our existing capabilities. And we're focusing our efforts on identifying high-growth on-trend areas with attractive margins and which are adjacent to our existing capabilities. That focusing formed the building of our Global Nutrition business. The acquisition of Wild gave us entry into flavors and a global taste platform. With end-used bolt-on acquisitions to add adjacent capabilities and build a one-stop shop with an industry-leading pantry of ingredients and solutions for human nutrition. We do the same for animal nutrition with the acquisition of Neovia. And we continue to do the same today as grows our business. In order to meet growing demand for sustainable solutions, we have announced a joint venture and offtake agreement with Marathon Oil Company to support the production of renewable diesel. We're continuing to invest in key nutrition categories. As demand for alternative protein grows from $10 billion to $30 billion over the next decade, we're further enhancing our work capabilities with the acquisition of Sojaprotein. And with global demand for pet foods growing $240 billion in the coming years, we are continuing our growth with a 75% ownership stake in PetDine. In the area of microbiome, we've signed an agreement with Vland Biotech to launch a joint venture that will perfectly position to help meet $1 billion in retail demand for probiotics in China. These are just some examples of how we are dynamically positioning our portfolio to continue driving growth for years to come. There will be more to come, and you can expect an increased level of investments to support our sustainable earnings growth and further expand our capacity and capabilities. Please turn to Slide 5. As part of our portfolio management approach, we're working to evolve our carbohydrate solutions business. Expanding our arrays of solutions to meet growing customer demand driven by the enduring trend of sustainability. We've made significant progress recently focused on two areas, new opportunities for our alcohol production and our growing value solutions platform. Then we start with alcohol. Last Thursday, we announced that we reached an agreement which we expect to close at the end of the month to sell our ethanol facility in Peoria. And yesterday, we announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Gevo to explore potential joint ventures, one of which would include our Columbus and see that rapid design mills, and our would've ethanol assets indicator. Transitioning 900 million gallons of ethanol production to support growing demand for low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuel. These actions represent our commitment to a process that we began when we first announced the third issue review of our dry mills review of our dry mills. Taken together, they will allow us to significantly reduce our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol while using our expertise and assets to capitalize on new opportunities. SAS is one of those opportunities. The U.S. and EU have set goals that together, will support almost 4 billion gallons of annual sustainable aviation of fuel production by 2030 and more than 45 billion by 2050. The other focus area for are carbohydrate solutions evolution is our bio solutions growth platform. Biosolutions, which we launched about a year ago, is an effort focused on using our product streams to expand our participation in sustainable, higher-margin solutions for attractive end markets like pharmaceuticals and personal care. This is an area of significant potential, and our team is doing a great job identifying new and exciting opportunities. Earlier this fall, for example, we signed an MOU with LG Chem for the production of lactic and polylactic acid for bioplastics and other plant-based products. These efforts are enabling value solutions to deliver 10% annualized revenue growth, Including more than $80 million in new revenue wins in the first 9 months of this year. And we believe there are many new opportunities to come. So from the transformation of our dry mills to our growing biosolutions platform, our work to evolve our would carbohydrate solutions capabilities is a perfect example of how we're managing our portfolio and delivering the smart strategic growth. And one of the many reasons we remain convinced in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings growth in the years to come. Lets talk a little bit more about our business outlook at the end of our call. And of course, we'll be going into much more detail at our Global Investor Day on December 10th. But in the meantime, I will turn the call over to Ray to talk about our business performance. Ray.\nRay Young: Yeah, thanks, Juan. Slide 6, please. The Ag Services in Oilseeds team continued their outstanding year with another quarter of substantial profit growth. In Ag Services, we're proud of how the team executed in a challenging environment, including a swift return to operation after Hurricane Ida. Overall results were significantly lower versus the prior year quarter, driven by approximately $50 million in net timing effects that should reverse in coming quarters, as well as $54 million in insurance settlement recorded in the prior year period and lower export volumes caused by Hurricane Ida. Global trade continues its strong performance. The crushing team delivered substantially higher year-over-year results executed well, delivering stronger margins in a dynamic environment that includes strong demand for vegetable oils to support our existing food customers, as well as the increasing production of renewable diesel. Results were also driven by about $70 million in net positive timing effects in the quarter. Refined products and other results were significantly higher than prior-year period driven by positive timing effects of approximately $80 million that are expected reverse in future quarters. Strong execution EMEA North America biodiesel, and strong refining premiums due to demand for renewable diesel, and food service recovery in North America also contributed to the results. Equity and earnings from Walmart were lower year-over-year. Now, looking ahead, we expect to see continued fundamental demand strength for egg service and oil seeds products, including from China, as well as solid global soybean crush margin environment in the Fourth Quarter. Partially offset by some higher manufacturing costs. In addition, RPO will be negatively impacted by timing reversals. All told, we expect results in the fourth quarter to be significantly higher than the third quarter of this year. Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate solution results were lower year-over-year. The starches and sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, showed their agility by managing through dynamic market conditions and optimizing mix between sweeteners and ethanol production through the quarter. Year-over-year results were significantly lower primarily due higher input cost. Vantage corn processor results were much higher versus the third quarter of 2020, supported by their resumption of production of -- at our 2 dry mills and improved fuel ethanol margins, particularly late in the quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the solid fundamentals from the end of the third quarter to continue for Carbohydrate Solutions with good ethanol margins extending through the quarter due to industry supply demand balance in solid demand for corn oil and starches, offset by higher manufacturing costs, particularly in Europe. As well as the absence of the Peoria dry mill. All told, fourth quarter results for the segment should be similar to the previous year fourth quarter. On Slide 8, the nutrition business remains on its solid growth trajectory with 17% higher revenues and 15% on a constant currency basis and 20% higher profits year-over-year in continued strong EBITDA margins. The Human Nutrition team delivered revenue growth of 12% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, helping to drive 9% higher profits. Higher volume, improved product mix for particular strength in beverage show strong flavor results in the  in North America, partially offset by lower results in APAC. Especially ingredients continued to benefit from strong demand for alternative proteins offset by some higher costs. Health and wellness results were higher on robust sales growth in bioactives and fiber. And nutrition profits were nearly  driven primarily by the strength in the mineral assets, as well as feed additives. Looking ahead. We expect nutrition to continue on its impressive growth path with strength across the human and animal nutrition, linked to strong year-over-year earnings expansion and a 20% full-year growth versus 2020. Slide 9, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment, as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were substantially lower in the prior year period, driven primarily by captive insurance underwriting losses, most of which were offset by corresponding recoveries in the other business segments. We expect fourth quarter to have some additional insurance underwriting losses resulting in a break even other business for the Fourth Quarter. As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased year-over-year on lower interest rates, and a favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. In the corporate lines, an allocate corporate costs of $230 million were driven primarily by higher IT offering and project-related costs into the centralized centers of  in supply chain and operations. Looking at total corporate costs,  in other corporate, we are still on track for the calendar year to be overall similar to 2020. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was approximately 18%. We anticipate our calendar-year adjusted effective tax rate to be the upper end of our previously communicated range of 14% to 16%, and potentially a bit higher depending upon the geographic mix in the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 26% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion. With that, I will turn it back to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ray. Slide 10 please. From consistent sustained profit growth to the ongoing management of our business and product portfolio, our team has a lot to be proud of. And there's one other thing we achieved last quarter that I want to mention. We have many team members impacted when Hurricane Ida hit in late August, so we provide the temporary housing arrangements, portable generators, food and water, and more. In fact, many ADM colleagues traveled to the region and spent time helping repair their co-worker's damaged homes. Out of that, I'm very thankful to our team.  as we plan to grow into our outlook in far more of depth on our December 10th Global Investor Day. As I look back at the Third Quarter, and all of the last 9 months, I continue to see a team and a Company that are delivering on our goals and our purpose. We are closing out 2021 with great momentum. We're on track for a strong Fourth Quarter, and the second consecutive year of record earnings per share. And as we look ahead to 2022, we see another strong year for ADM. A robust global demand environment will continue to look for opportunities for us to leverage our indispensable globally origination, processing and logistics capabilities. And nutrition will continue on its strong growth trajectory in line with our 15% and on its way to a billion dollars in operating profit in the coming years. Of course, there are  widely. Thanks to our unique value chain and global footprint, our unmatched  and well-being and sustainability, and a truly unparalleled team of nearly 40,000 colleagues around the world, we remain very optimistic in the strong year to come. With that, Emily, \nOperator: To register your questions, please,  Our first question today comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Ben, your line is open.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nVikram Luthar: Morning Ben.\nRay Young: Hey, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: I've got one long-term question with regards to your announcement yesterday around SAS. And then I want to ask a clarifier on the guidance. Yesterday, congratulations. A couple of questions. One is, when you think about the total opportunity for SAS, obviously the embedded demand is significant, given SAS seems like one of the most pertinent ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, though are unclear at this time. So I'm curious has you think about engaging with Gevo on this partnership? One, well, to commit these facilities. to this end market ultimately. And then to help us think about kind of the  the Memorandum of Understanding, why did you go with that initially versus a more legally binding agreement? And then, if you would just talk just bigger picture  the ethanol markets that would be helpful. I know a lot in there, but I'd love to hear you talk about it.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ben. We've been looking at the options for the dry mills for a very, very long time. So we've been studying the opportunities for the ADM shareholders to o as we try to divert these assets. Certainly, when we look at the sustainability trends and the opportunities, remember one of the issues with these assets are, they are very large. Would become -- would became a little bit of an issue at the time by testing them. So we were looking for opportunities that are sizable. We are that size turns into a competitive advantage. So certainly, when you look at all the industries to CO2, and we have identified, and we have checked with strategic partners, people in the industry that they say yes, is the solution. And I think we see also concurrently that both the U.S. and the European governments are looking at this a year final, trying to incentive the demand for that. So you heard President Biden or Secretary Franco for making statements about that. So we see a very positive environment developing for this, a very sizable adjustable markets for us. And when you combine our size with our raw material procurement and our costs and the ability to decarbonize based on our carbon capture and sequestration. As you recall, we've been running since 2017. Allows that complex to provide very competitive, low CI fuels for the industry. So we decided to . There are many opportunities and options potentially could happen, which is the creation of these two joint ventures. In one of those joint ventures, ADMs contribution  will be the 2 dry mills as I would objective it as to deconsolidate these two. So again, but still too many discussions to happen and many foreigners to join us into this. We are thinking over time to have a minority position in diesel, having probably strategics of financial foreigners to join us. So -- but overall, as you can be assured, this is a better outcome for our shareholders in terms of the realization of value from these two drivers. So we're very excited about the opportunities.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Great. My next question is a clarifier in the discussion to the extent you can on 2022. First, Ray, did I hear you say on the Ag Services and Oilseeds for the fourth quarter, you expect it to be higher than the third quarter, but you didn't say higher than the fourth quarter last year? Is that -- are those the goalpost we should be thinking about? That's part 1, and then question 2 within that is, export demand looks strong for next year, obviously renewable diesel is continuing to gain steam. How do you feel about Ag Services and crushing in that broader Ag Services and Oilseeds segments as we go into 2022?\nJuan Luciano: So Ben, listen. As we think about Q4 for ADM, and when we say we expect a strong Q4, we look at strong crush margins, demand this is strong for proteins, but also the demand for Oilseeds very strong and tight and then you add RGD on top of that. We are facing an improved ethanol environment as we enter the Q4. We are estimating exports from the U.S. in volume similar to last year.  competitors plant is down because of our same situation. And then we continue to see nutrition growing at 15 to 20%. Inflation, we have energy issues that the team is dealing with it and trying to mitigate. But we're coming into Q4 and into Q1 with a strong momentum. We feel very strong about crush margins. Our  export window given that in September we didn't export that much, is probably going to be extended into January or February. A little bit maybe even longer than last year. So we feel very good at the moment, but again, with an environment that there are supply chain issues, there are energy inflation rising, so we will have to manage all that, but from a demand perspective, we feel very good about it.\nOperator: From Bank of America. Luke, your line is now open.\nLuke Washer: Thank you. Good morning, team.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning.\nRay Young: Good morning, Luke.\nLuke Washer: I just wanted to ask a quick question and follow-up on Ben. You mentioned that the Peoria facility and this new MOU, Gevo, you've done a lot with your ethanol assets. So just a clarifying point, are your strategic review of the ethanol assets completed? Are you still thinking about  Now how you're looking at your fuel ethanol capacity, even wet mills, or is you're thinking now evolve?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah, no, I would say that the conclusion of its  review ended being the best option for Peoria was to divest it, which was basically shed about 135 million gallons of our ethanol capacity. And then we are taking about 2/3 of all our ethanol capacity in these MoU with Gevo exploring options solidating because we're going to be reviewed in these to joined . The assets to the joint venture. But of course we're going to have some exposure to ethanol on the long-term basis because that's changed for ethanol. First of all, remember we always said we didn't like the undifferentiating nature of dry mills. In wet mills, we have more options to protect margins and to protect returns. But secondly, is by taking all these capacity out of out of the market, basically got 900 million gallons in about two years are going to move from vehicle ethanol to SAS feedstock. Then we think that supply demand fundamentals and the margin environment that concludes our  to now execute on the transaction  but still have a lot to be discussed.\nLuke Washer: That makes sense. And then just staying on Carbohydrate Solutions quickly. Ray, I believe you said that operating profit  last year and ethanol margin  turned it looks like you were able to continue  seem to be pretty good in 4Q. So when I think about the starches and sweeteners side, it would seem that you are seeing quite a bit of maybe margin compression or at least lower operating profit. Is this just a the function of you have higher input costs? And then how are you thinking about what you're selling, some of your sweeteners at or starches that will offset some of that margin pressure potentially?\nRay Young: No, you're right. We're vertically over in Europe. So that's a little bit of a headwind. At the same time, you are right and the ethanol margins that we're seeing right now in the market are extremely healthy. And that's just reflective above to fallen down to 20 million variables right now. And when you take a look at driving miles in gasoline demand, were sickly back to pre -pandemic levels of demand again. And so on the positive side, I would have to say the ethanol margins. On the issue of sweeteners and starches, what's interesting is while a lot of people focus on the HFCS guide the business, the other parts of our business are doing extremely well than the non - HFCS business. For example, citric acid demand is extremely strong, starches demand, extremely strong. So when we put it all together, that's why we provided the guidance that there are some puts and takes, but we expect our fourth quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions to be similar to where we were last year.\nLuke Washer: Got it. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Ken, please go ahead.\nKen Zaslow: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Zaslow: The investments that you have made, there's several of them, and the 75% in the tech business, the LG Chem, the ACS  So how much capital have you deployed to this? What is the return expected on the -- I'll start there and then I'll ask the follow-up to that.\nRay Young: Yeah, I mean, I think we haven't disclosed the amount of capital in terms of the LG Chem, I mean, that's still up -- being discussed right now in terms of how the partnership will form on lactic acid and polylactic acid. The access vial is not that significant. The big, big investment that you mentioned here is really the P4, the  investment, the  Company. And again, we decided to invest 75% into it, right? So therefore, I think we've managed that capital there. So the total invested capital on these recent announcement, actually, is far less than the billion dollars . This is consistent with the kind of the bolt-on type of investment numbers that we've talked about in the past, Ken.\nKen Zaslow: And then also those Sojaprotein. But if I take that and then, one, you said that in 2022, from nutrition, you still expecting that 15 and then you blood is up a little bit to 15% to 20%, which is always nice to hear. But if you're adding less than a billion, but it sounds like more than a breadbasket, is that number going to start to capitals work? Would we start to see that number accelerate at what year and what type of returns that we expected or is it just not enough to make a difference? I'm just trying to cement that in my head.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Certainly, Ken, we will see acceleration based on these investments. When we talked about our plan of 15%, that plan was not contemplating any significant acquisitions. And we were thinking and getting to about a billion-dollar OPE in a couple of years, so that trajectory continues and will be accelerated with some of these deals. Some of these deals you have to understand are just bolt - ons where we plant some capacity where we don't have like in Sojaprotein and things like that, and some other ones become more platforms that actually give us people to accelerate even more our growth rate. But we will continue in an investment phase on Nutrition because the opportunities are there. Our customers are reacting positively to our value proposition and we see our pipeline and our quarterly wins continue to grow. As long as we can post numbers of revenue growth in the 15% range and OP growth in the \nKen Zaslow: Are you outlining, every year you do it.  consumer trend better, you believe is going to be the future of where we're going. This one you laid out a -- when you think of your portfolio, what percentage of your portfolio you think targets those 8 today and then when I think back in 3 to 5 years, what percentage of your portfolio will target those 8 items. And then I'll leave it there and I appreciate your time.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. That's a very good question to which we'll provide more granularity at the December  Investor Day, but I will say in general terms, and that's where you see us working on the evolution of the Carbohydrate Solutions portfolio. Probably, the Carbohydrate Solutions portfolio because of  the big assets, it's a one more difficult to adjust to some of these. We think that our services in all  and nutrition, are margin  that's more aligned to that. And now that we are evolving the portfolio of Car solutions, we feel that the significant percentage of ADMs in couple of years will be aligned towards these trends. Which make us very optimistic about the future. We are very well-positioned for all these long-term trends.\nKen Zaslow: But in the  you, percentages are something to give some context to it like, hey, by 5 years will be at 25% or 30% or something part of how you're thinking. So I just hope that you do that. We appreciate it. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. We will provide that granulating. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Michael, your line is open.\nMichael Piken: To understand a little bit better your outlook for exports, you mentioned that you think the outlook for China and their grain demand can be strong. Could you quantify what you think for their corn and soybean exports for the next year and then also the U.S. share of what's going to go to China?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah, Mike  listen, we still believe that protein demand is very strong. And when we look and we check with our team in China, we still believe that China will need to import about a 100 million tons give or take of soybeans and about 25 million tons of corn. So of that corn, the majority will come from the U.S. a little bit from Ukraine. So we think that the volumes, although maybe a slightly in a different way than last year, right now, consumers are a little bit more short term. More hand-to-mouth, if you will, because they were expecting from a little bit of a correction in prices as we were hitting the harvest in the last few weeks. And we feel very good about this exports season. You have to remember that we were in a tight situation from a supply-demand perspective given these import numbers. And then when you add that, some of that capacity has been taken out, this will make it for a tight exports season that will probably have rolled forward maybe a month since in October -- at the beginning of October all these facilities were still trying to recover power.\nMichael Piken: Right. And then my follow-up is just -- it seems like right now there's shortages of fertilizer and maybe  say. What is your expectations for in Brazil or even in the U.S.? Do you think we're going to be able to have enough fertilizer to plant crops around the world? And what does that mean for your fertilizer business that more broadly speaking? Are you worried about being able to get enough crop plant around the world or how -- what's the work around from that? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Listen, at this point in time, it's a matter of price, of course, so natural gas have driven this up. Different situation when you 're in Europe than you 're in North America. So North America is paying like 5 bucks to 6 bucks for natural gas; Europe is paying maybe 30. But I will say, at this point in time, it continues to be available for farmers only at higher prices. And we haven't detected a big shift in acreage from one to the other. It's still a little bit early from planting intentions, and you could think that potentially could be a shift from corn to soybeans, that is not clear yet. And probably, the numbers today are a little bit of a tossup for the farmer on what to go. So, acreage for next year.\nMichael Piken: Okay great. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Simonitsch from JP Morgan. Tom, your line is open.\nTom Simonitsch: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey Tom. So you just  in China to serve as a supply hub in the region. What is your outlook for Nutrition in Asia-Pacific compared to other regions? You've called out APAC is an area of weakness in both Human and Animal Nutrition in the last couple of quarters. So how much of that relative weakness is down to ADM's current capabilities in the region, as opposed to .\nJuan Luciano: Right. I think that we've been very proud of being  nutrition is  have been happening on the developed parts of the world, if you will, in which developing market's exposure is still  hold for ADM, whether we're talking about South America or Asia Pacific. So in Asia Pacific, we've been a player  flavors for a while and this is just an expansion. This is at about an hour a way from consumption. So we feel very good from a raw material perspective. We feel very good from an access to a big consumption base. And this will be very important for our customers. Our participation in Asia was limited to one plant for Flavors and about a handful of plants for animal nutrition. And we continue to build that position in animal nutrition. We feel very good about it. And then given this opportunity in flavors, we will enhance our capabilities, not just production, but also market development and probability for customer innovation centers. So you will see us going and putting more flags from the -- on the world in the developing areas. Whether it is Asia-Pacific or South-America, as we need to go and support our global customers. These are our customers that we do business every day here. And some of them are represented there, but also we have a lot of new local customers that are requiring these capabilities. So it's just a natural evolution of the business if you will.\nTom Simonitsch: Thanks for that, Juan. And just following up on SAS. What is your operating plan for the two dry mills between now and 2025, when that SCF production is expected to come online?\nRay Young: We expect  construction around that area. There probably is some transition. But as we look out over the next couple of years, we do expect that driving models are going to -- are coming back, we're seeing tight S&D right now in terms of our industry. We are seeing frankly the rest of the world is starting to recover from the pandemic. So we expect rest-of-world driving miles to start recovering. And so therefore, there is a lag in terms of recovery of exports of ethanol from U.S. to the rest of the world. So I think over the next couple of years, I think you're going to continue to see some level of demand recovery from outside the U.S. for ethanol, and then even China, as we talked about, I mean, they're focused on the environment, on energy. You could actually see China and  returning back to the markets. And we've seen a little bit of that already.\nJuan Luciano: So let me clarify from an operating's perspective. We now going to be doing anything two these dry mills. So dry mills will produce ethanol. And then there is downstream technology and capabilities that Gevo brings to the table to transform them into SAS. But those two plants will continue to produce ethanol as they are. We are not planning to invest capital into that. Our contribution is those two plants, and then Gevo takes it from there, from a downstream perspective.\nTom Simonitsch: That's very helpful. Thank you. I will leave it there and pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Ben, please proceed.\nBen Theurer: Good morning.  Ray congrats on the results. Just two quick follow-up questions. One on  and I understand your commentary around the expectation into the Fourth Quarter, but just trying to maybe get a little bit of a sense differently. So clearly, you have some implications in the third quarter because of Hurricane Ida, and you expect some of those effects to reverse in coming quarters. Are you comfortable enough that those almost immediately reversing and benefiting your fourth quarter, so to speak, you have a chance to get some workflows to where it was last year. So that will be my first question.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. I would say, we expect a strong quarter for our services in this year. And you have to understand when sometimes at the end  the year it becomes complicated because they could be margin expansion, margin contraction here, and the accounting rules  according to Q1 and we need to respect that. What we're talking, what we can be determine from middle of October, which is today, is the fundamentals from the market, and demand is strong, and the export capacity it was tight starting into these. And we started to see our so we feel good about it. But again, it's difficult to call it sometimes Q4 versus Q1 because of the accounting rules and we can determine that now, we have to determine that at the end of the \nBen Theurer: Perfect. And then if we take a look at the Nutrition business and you've highlighted it in your prepared remarks. Obviously, the very strong performance on the Animal Nutrition side, almost doubling operating profit but then Human Nutrition on the other side grow for  just in the high single-digits. Could you explore a little more on the details of what were the issues for the maybe  lower than what you would want to see grow in Human Nutrition? Was it more of an impact because of input cost pressure where you just didn't pass that on significantly in the way you would have wanted to, or are there certain demand issues  there's still in certain areas? Just to understand a little better what's been driving the growth in human nutritional  some of the growth that way better.\nJuan Luciano: If you look at the Human Nutrition for the quarter, we grew revenue about 12%. I mean, it's actually a pretty good number, and I think, if you look at our EBITDA margin on sales, we were able to maintain that EBITDA margin on sales. So when you grow twice the industry clip, if you will, and you maintain margins, so I was pretty satisfied. Of course, it's not the spectacular maybe improvement year-over-year than Animal Nutrition have, but this is because Human Nutrition has been more stable and doing -- in animals, we're still going through the Neovia integration and all those things, but no, I don't think it was a weak quarter at all actually. Actually, I think as I said, we continue to grow maybe twice the industry rates and maintaining very robust EBITDA margins on sales. So EBITDA margins on sales for flavors are north of 20%. And we've been able to maintain despite \nBen Theurer:  Congrats again,. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Robert, please proceed.\nRobert Moskow: Just a couple of cleanup questions. Can you talk about your pricing outlook for corn sweeteners? It would appear that corn prices have been on kind of a roller coaster, they're down off their highs. And how is that impacting negotiations for next year? And then I had a follow-up on the pea protein market.\nRay Young: Hey, Robert. It's Ray here. So the contracting season's underway, and we expect HFCS volumes and margins for EM to remain strong in 2022. Clearly, we did see some volatility in terms of corn prices. And that's -- Frankly, the input costs will get reflected in terms of our contract pricing. And we do expect contract pricing to be higher next year compared to this year. Volume-wise, we do expect volumes for '22 to be similar to what we've seen this year.\nJuan Luciano: You're seeing recovery in terms of the Food Service Sector. What -- when I look at Carbohydrate Solutions in total, non-HFCS is actually a very important component as well. And we've seen non-HFCS  pretty attractive with a good margin  side. And that's just reflective of really a strong demand environment for citric acid, for starches, for dextrose, and other products. So that's another important factor when you take a look  And look at Carbohydrate Solutions business in total for 2022. As I indicated earlier, we do think that the bio-fuel part of the business should be actually quite positive when you compare  year compared to this year. So when you put it all together, we do expect  solution to have another strong \nRobert Moskow: And then the follow-up on pea proteins. You mentioned -- I think alternative protein. I thought I had heard that the pea crop in Canada was weak. But my perception is that that doesn't matter that much to processors like yourself. But maybe you can help me understand whether it does or it doesn't, and how much volume are you doing in that market for the alternatively end markets.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah, Rob.  facility, and we feel very good about that business, actually. Specialty Ingredient Systems that we see in some of these new verticals. And both businesses are relatively new. They have almost no revenue  solutions for customers. We have a strong customer interest in these areas and everybody wants to  foundation. So at this point in time, soy is the main driver for us.  or a supplement or is different  perspective. It's not a big impact, so we haven't felt any impact in our plant at all.\nRobert Moskow: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews, from Morgan Stanley. Vincent your line is open.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. One, just want to ask you on the LGM -- LG Chem, excuse me. The LG Chem JV. Why is it set up in two JVs rather than just one integrated production of lack of asset and then into THA? What's the thought process behind having an upstream and the downstream set up?\nJuan Luciano: This is a matter of where the expertise of each Company lies and, to be honest also, we want to be as asset life as possible. So in areas where LG is dominant and they're going to build that downstream capacity. When we think about value solutions, our objective , is to make , an ownership position and  we start making chemicals  application technology and all that, we cannot become a chemical Company. So in that, we let the partner, take  position. So we make corn grind plus one if you will, and then we let our partners take it from there. Which is a matter of optimized capital for us and not getting best scenario as where we are -- that are not coal for us. Coal areas for us will continue to be  within feed and beverages. When we go into these materials, if we're going to produce  that make sense, and then we have the partner doing the rest. Once we get the full details of the agreement, we'll see where the economics are setup and that would make sense to your investments will be in your target is trying to\nVincent Andrews: focus in net-to-net. As a follow-up, on the fertilizer issue, obviously the availability concerns, but seems like it's happening, it's at the high prices, they're deferring fertilizer purchases, particularly in South America. How percentage of the big soy groups  to buy less fertilizer, etc., and to you slide showing that farmer sales are I guess at a 5-year average, which is probably okay, but they're well below last year and probably the year before. So what impact does that have on your origination business if the farmer is slow to sell the beans or if they buy less fertilizers, then he may hold onto more beans if they want to keep the FX -- keep the dollars. So how do you think about that playing out for you moving into next year?\nJuan Luciano: I'll say South America is always an issue with a little bit more factors in terms of farmer selling just because, although currency and under distortion that sometimes the government bring s into the  we continue to see maybe relatively slow farmer selling in Argentina and that will probably continue. It's been a little bit better in  in Brazil recently, but it's still relatively slow versus the accelerated pace at which they sold last year.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vincent Anderson from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nVincent Anderson: Yes. Thanks. And I would like to continue as Vincent. Vincent  of questioning on PLA.Maybe just approaching it from trying to prioritize getting incremental return out of your core competency and fermentation technology, but maybe limiting direct participation in the PLA Market. And I ask just because that is a bit more of a commodity business than it feels like you've pushed more of your investments to recently?\nJuan Luciano: I think that as we said, we are trying to and I think that you said we're trying to optimize our facilities and as such those facilities to demand that has more growth opportunity. In this issue, again, we don't want to go into making chemicals. That's a heavy capital intensive industry, and we want to make one derivative and then, reserve all that capital to continue to grow in food, feed, and beverages, and in health and wellness, that's what we're trying to do so LG Chem is a great partner. We're very honored to have them. They have very good technology and it's a little bit like the  discussions. We're going to continue to make ethanol, they will take it from there to make SAF. And with the -- with these partnerships, we're going to make lactic. They're going to take it from there to make PLA. So it's kind of a similar mindset.\nVincent Anderson: That's perfect. Thank you. Then just a quick point of clarification, if I understand the phrasing of that MOU announcement, it sounded like you're considering investing in lactic acid capacity that would maybe exceed LG's needs and then you would market the remaining product yourself. Is that correct? Then could you just talk briefly about the opportunity there as a stand-alone investment?\nJuan Luciano: Listen, partial of that is correct. I mean, lactic it can go to many opportunities. But this is relatively early on  on the teams are looking at these. There is a lot -- there are a lot of numbers, there are a lot of things that could still change, there are a lot of discussions. So I wouldn't like to venture that much since the teams are still discussing with LG Chem and by 2050, 2060, 2040, whatever it is that these are they are looking back at their portfolio. They need to clean their portfolios, if you will. And one of the ways to do that is through recycling, the other way to do it is to go in plant-based. So we are receiving a lot of inbound request on that, and we're looking at our profits, our ability to produce plant-based products on our carbon capture and sequestration that provides an opportunity to make lower CI products. And we're trying to maximize the opportunity for ADM on all these. So some of these things may not be that well-defined because  that volume for the ADM shareholders. But it's a great opportunity for us and we will be mindful of returns and we not going to veer into areas that we shouldn't be putting capitals.  The capital will be reserved for our main thrust of the strategy, which is to continue to grow in food, and feed, and beverage.\nVincent Anderson: Understood. I appreciate the added  detail on that. Look forward to hearing more about it.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Larson from Seaport Research Partners. Eric, your line is open.\nEric Larson:  and the whole transaction. And I know that one of your -- maybe  your dislike that you had with ethanol over the years is the extreme volatility of  factors and when we talk about the  in the past, one of the things was trying to reduce your earnings volatility. So in your -- in the economic of how you nego -- We don't know much they are, but have you been able to -- do you think you've able to ink an agreement that actually gives you more sustainability or I guess plus volatility of current things on the economics of SAF going forward relative to ethanol.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. You're correct that Returns are important to us, but also dumping the volatility is in the mind of everything we do. So, of course, the team is considering that. I can't disclose that much at this early on. But I think what you need to also think is that over time, we will try to become a minority partner in all these. And the objective all these is to deconsolidate and take all those assets out of our participation. So to a certain degree, we're acting  owners long-term of this. That's why I talked before about  partners or financial partners. I think we're going to be able to deconsolidate. We're going to be able to monetize some amounts and if there is some upside to that, hopefully participate in all that. But you are correct. The objective is not to participate in \nEric Larson: Okay, no that is  a lot. So when you look at the size of your  investments, they're -- those are relatively new assets, but I guess they're probably 8 to 10 years older obviously you so you've probably depreciated them pretty significantly already. Is your contribution to the  putting those assets in there, or would you expect to see maybe a modest capital return as part of that JV Agreement as well?\nJuan Luciano: One of the reasons, Eric, that we landed in this option is that the valuation of our assets, I mean, it's better than the alternatives that we have. So we are pleased with the value at which we are contributing these 2 assets. We don't need or we don't plan to add  as such, then the joint venture or Gevo may put money for finishing of the -- and to convert it into  through their technology. But our participation stops with the contribution of these 2 dry mills as they are.\nEric Larson: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Juan, my questions at that. Thanks, everybody.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam, your line is open.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Adam. Hi. Well, a lot of ground bidding covered. so I'll try and make this quick. On the DSAS MoU, can you just maybe clarify just in the beginning factors of what you'd be looking for on the regulatory side to really move ahead here. Obviously, SAS doesn't participate today in the RFS or California programs. So what would you want to see in terms of the federal or state action on SAS before you really fully commit to going ahead?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Listen, we have experienced in both the U.S. and the European Union a strong desire to make this a reality. There is no another efficient way to decarbonize the airlines industry -- the aviation industry. Of course, on the short hauls, you can put the , long hauls is something like this. So we expect the governments to be a partner, to a certain degree, in creating some of these markets. Some of those things are too early for me to disclose. But there are commitments both the U.S. government and the European Union to create a market for that in the 50 billion gallons type of size. So there's going to be some helping in to that. But that's probably to the extent that I can talk about it right now.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. And then, just quickly on the Balance Sheet, maybe this is for Ray. At the end of the quarter, net debt to EBITDA was sub two times. You haven't bought back any stock this year. Just help us think about how we should think about stock buyback as part of the capital allocation mix going forward.\nRay Young: I think that as we -- we've been monitoring commodity prices very carefully. And when you look in our offering working capital, right now it's still $2 billion higher than we were last year. So as we think about commodity prices next year, assuming you have a strong South America crop, you have a normal crop in U.S.. You see commodity prices coming off again. And after we've funded some of the bolt-on acquisitions that we've talked about, I expect our Balance Sheet to be pretty strong. And so there we can probably start looking back at return of capital that we've looked like in the pa st. So I think a lot of it is a function of funding the investments that we've talked about, but importantly, making sure that the working capital environment reverts back to normalized levels, which I think -- I sense, assuming a normal South America crop, a normal U.S. crop next year. I see opportunities to look at return of capital.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. All right. I'll leave it there Thanks so much.\nRay Young: Thank you, Adam.\nJuan Luciano: We'll be headlining on December 10th, Global Investor Day. We look forward to talking in more detail projectory and why we are so optimistic about the opportunities ahead. In the meantime, as always, feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone for joining us today. This now concludes today's conference call, please now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Vikram. This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, but it's a 9% year-over-year improvement despite a higher tax rate. And our year-to-date adjusted EPS of $3.69 is already above our full-year 2020 adjusted EPS. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1 billion, up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020. And our 8th consecutive quarter of year-over-year OP growth. Our trailing 4-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.6 billion, almost a billion more than a year ago. And our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.6%, significantly higher versus the year-ago period. I remain proud to lead a global team that is delivering robust returns and sustained growth in profits. Our strong quarter and our ongoing upward trajectory are a testament to our team's execution and agility, and the consistent implementation of our strategic plan. I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter. Slide 4, please. I'd like to start by talking about our approach to portfolio management. Our starting point if they believe that in order to thrive and create value, a Company needs to have a dynamic view of its business portfolio. So when we talked about the dramatic transformation of our portfolio over the last 10 years, it's not a discrete event, it's a representation of our continuous work to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. Of course, those opportunities may be the -- must be the right ones. The enduring trends of food security, health, and well-being, and sustainability, provide unique and stable opportunities for ADM to expand our existing capabilities. And we're focusing our efforts on identifying high-growth on-trend areas with attractive margins and which are adjacent to our existing capabilities. That focusing formed the building of our Global Nutrition business. The acquisition of Wild gave us entry into flavors and a global taste platform. With end-used bolt-on acquisitions to add adjacent capabilities and build a one-stop shop with an industry-leading pantry of ingredients and solutions for human nutrition. We do the same for animal nutrition with the acquisition of Neovia. And we continue to do the same today as grows our business. In order to meet growing demand for sustainable solutions, we have announced a joint venture and offtake agreement with Marathon Oil Company to support the production of renewable diesel. We're continuing to invest in key nutrition categories. As demand for alternative protein grows from $10 billion to $30 billion over the next decade, we're further enhancing our work capabilities with the acquisition of Sojaprotein. And with global demand for pet foods growing $240 billion in the coming years, we are continuing our growth with a 75% ownership stake in PetDine. In the area of microbiome, we've signed an agreement with Vland Biotech to launch a joint venture that will perfectly position to help meet $1 billion in retail demand for probiotics in China. These are just some examples of how we are dynamically positioning our portfolio to continue driving growth for years to come. There will be more to come, and you can expect an increased level of investments to support our sustainable earnings growth and further expand our capacity and capabilities. Please turn to Slide 5. As part of our portfolio management approach, we're working to evolve our carbohydrate solutions business. Expanding our arrays of solutions to meet growing customer demand driven by the enduring trend of sustainability. We've made significant progress recently focused on two areas, new opportunities for our alcohol production and our growing value solutions platform. Then we start with alcohol. Last Thursday, we announced that we reached an agreement which we expect to close at the end of the month to sell our ethanol facility in Peoria. And yesterday, we announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Gevo to explore potential joint ventures, one of which would include our Columbus and see that rapid design mills, and our would've ethanol assets indicator. Transitioning 900 million gallons of ethanol production to support growing demand for low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuel. These actions represent our commitment to a process that we began when we first announced the third issue review of our dry mills review of our dry mills. Taken together, they will allow us to significantly reduce our exposure to vehicle fuel ethanol while using our expertise and assets to capitalize on new opportunities. SAS is one of those opportunities. The U.S. and EU have set goals that together, will support almost 4 billion gallons of annual sustainable aviation of fuel production by 2030 and more than 45 billion by 2050. The other focus area for are carbohydrate solutions evolution is our bio solutions growth platform. Biosolutions, which we launched about a year ago, is an effort focused on using our product streams to expand our participation in sustainable, higher-margin solutions for attractive end markets like pharmaceuticals and personal care. This is an area of significant potential, and our team is doing a great job identifying new and exciting opportunities. Earlier this fall, for example, we signed an MOU with LG Chem for the production of lactic and polylactic acid for bioplastics and other plant-based products. These efforts are enabling value solutions to deliver 10% annualized revenue growth, Including more than $80 million in new revenue wins in the first 9 months of this year. And we believe there are many new opportunities to come. So from the transformation of our dry mills to our growing biosolutions platform, our work to evolve our would carbohydrate solutions capabilities is a perfect example of how we're managing our portfolio and delivering the smart strategic growth. And one of the many reasons we remain convinced in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings growth in the years to come. Lets talk a little bit more about our business outlook at the end of our call. And of course, we'll be going into much more detail at our Global Investor Day on December 10th. But in the meantime, I will turn the call over to Ray to talk about our business performance. Ray. Thank you, Ray. Slide 10 please. From consistent sustained profit growth to the ongoing management of our business and product portfolio, our team has a lot to be proud of. And there's one other thing we achieved last quarter that I want to mention. We have many team members impacted when Hurricane Ida hit in late August, so we provide the temporary housing arrangements, portable generators, food and water, and more. In fact, many ADM colleagues traveled to the region and spent time helping repair their co-worker's damaged homes. Out of that, I'm very thankful to our team.  as we plan to grow into our outlook in far more of depth on our December 10th Global Investor Day. As I look back at the Third Quarter, and all of the last 9 months, I continue to see a team and a Company that are delivering on our goals and our purpose. We are closing out 2021 with great momentum. We're on track for a strong Fourth Quarter, and the second consecutive year of record earnings per share. And as we look ahead to 2022, we see another strong year for ADM. A robust global demand environment will continue to look for opportunities for us to leverage our indispensable globally origination, processing and logistics capabilities. And nutrition will continue on its strong growth trajectory in line with our 15% and on its way to a billion dollars in operating profit in the coming years. Of course, there are  widely. Thanks to our unique value chain and global footprint, our unmatched  and well-being and sustainability, and a truly unparalleled team of nearly 40,000 colleagues around the world, we remain very optimistic in the strong year to come. With that, Emily, Thank you, Ben. We've been looking at the options for the dry mills for a very, very long time. So we've been studying the opportunities for the ADM shareholders to o as we try to divert these assets. Certainly, when we look at the sustainability trends and the opportunities, remember one of the issues with these assets are, they are very large. Would become -- would became a little bit of an issue at the time by testing them. So we were looking for opportunities that are sizable. We are that size turns into a competitive advantage. So certainly, when you look at all the industries to CO2, and we have identified, and we have checked with strategic partners, people in the industry that they say yes, is the solution. And I think we see also concurrently that both the U.S. and the European governments are looking at this a year final, trying to incentive the demand for that. So you heard President Biden or Secretary Franco for making statements about that. So we see a very positive environment developing for this, a very sizable adjustable markets for us. And when you combine our size with our raw material procurement and our costs and the ability to decarbonize based on our carbon capture and sequestration. As you recall, we've been running since 2017. Allows that complex to provide very competitive, low CI fuels for the industry. So we decided to . There are many opportunities and options potentially could happen, which is the creation of these two joint ventures. In one of those joint ventures, ADMs contribution  will be the 2 dry mills as I would objective it as to deconsolidate these two. So again, but still too many discussions to happen and many foreigners to join us into this. We are thinking over time to have a minority position in diesel, having probably strategics of financial foreigners to join us. So -- but overall, as you can be assured, this is a better outcome for our shareholders in terms of the realization of value from these two drivers. So we're very excited about the opportunities. So Ben, listen. As we think about Q4 for ADM, and when we say we expect a strong Q4, we look at strong crush margins, demand this is strong for proteins, but also the demand for Oilseeds very strong and tight and then you add RGD on top of that. We are facing an improved ethanol environment as we enter the Q4. We are estimating exports from the U.S. in volume similar to last year.  competitors plant is down because of our same situation. And then we continue to see nutrition growing at 15 to 20%. Inflation, we have energy issues that the team is dealing with it and trying to mitigate. But we're coming into Q4 and into Q1 with a strong momentum. We feel very strong about crush margins. Our  export window given that in September we didn't export that much, is probably going to be extended into January or February. A little bit maybe even longer than last year. So we feel very good at the moment, but again, with an environment that there are supply chain issues, there are energy inflation rising, so we will have to manage all that, but from a demand perspective, we feel very good about it. Good morning. Yeah, no, I would say that the conclusion of its  review ended being the best option for Peoria was to divest it, which was basically shed about 135 million gallons of our ethanol capacity. And then we are taking about 2/3 of all our ethanol capacity in these MoU with Gevo exploring options solidating because we're going to be reviewed in these to joined . The assets to the joint venture. But of course we're going to have some exposure to ethanol on the long-term basis because that's changed for ethanol. First of all, remember we always said we didn't like the undifferentiating nature of dry mills. In wet mills, we have more options to protect margins and to protect returns. But secondly, is by taking all these capacity out of out of the market, basically got 900 million gallons in about two years are going to move from vehicle ethanol to SAS feedstock. Then we think that supply demand fundamentals and the margin environment that concludes our  to now execute on the transaction  but still have a lot to be discussed. Good morning, Ken. Yeah. Certainly, Ken, we will see acceleration based on these investments. When we talked about our plan of 15%, that plan was not contemplating any significant acquisitions. And we were thinking and getting to about a billion-dollar OPE in a couple of years, so that trajectory continues and will be accelerated with some of these deals. Some of these deals you have to understand are just bolt - ons where we plant some capacity where we don't have like in Sojaprotein and things like that, and some other ones become more platforms that actually give us people to accelerate even more our growth rate. But we will continue in an investment phase on Nutrition because the opportunities are there. Our customers are reacting positively to our value proposition and we see our pipeline and our quarterly wins continue to grow. As long as we can post numbers of revenue growth in the 15% range and OP growth in the Yeah. That's a very good question to which we'll provide more granularity at the December  Investor Day, but I will say in general terms, and that's where you see us working on the evolution of the Carbohydrate Solutions portfolio. Probably, the Carbohydrate Solutions portfolio because of  the big assets, it's a one more difficult to adjust to some of these. We think that our services in all  and nutrition, are margin  that's more aligned to that. And now that we are evolving the portfolio of Car solutions, we feel that the significant percentage of ADMs in couple of years will be aligned towards these trends. Which make us very optimistic about the future. We are very well-positioned for all these long-term trends. Yes. We will provide that granulating. Thank you. Yeah, Mike  listen, we still believe that protein demand is very strong. And when we look and we check with our team in China, we still believe that China will need to import about a 100 million tons give or take of soybeans and about 25 million tons of corn. So of that corn, the majority will come from the U.S. a little bit from Ukraine. So we think that the volumes, although maybe a slightly in a different way than last year, right now, consumers are a little bit more short term. More hand-to-mouth, if you will, because they were expecting from a little bit of a correction in prices as we were hitting the harvest in the last few weeks. And we feel very good about this exports season. You have to remember that we were in a tight situation from a supply-demand perspective given these import numbers. And then when you add that, some of that capacity has been taken out, this will make it for a tight exports season that will probably have rolled forward maybe a month since in October -- at the beginning of October all these facilities were still trying to recover power. Yeah. Listen, at this point in time, it's a matter of price, of course, so natural gas have driven this up. Different situation when you 're in Europe than you 're in North America. So North America is paying like 5 bucks to 6 bucks for natural gas; Europe is paying maybe 30. But I will say, at this point in time, it continues to be available for farmers only at higher prices. And we haven't detected a big shift in acreage from one to the other. It's still a little bit early from planting intentions, and you could think that potentially could be a shift from corn to soybeans, that is not clear yet. And probably, the numbers today are a little bit of a tossup for the farmer on what to go. So, acreage for next year. Thank you. Right. I think that we've been very proud of being  nutrition is  have been happening on the developed parts of the world, if you will, in which developing market's exposure is still  hold for ADM, whether we're talking about South America or Asia Pacific. So in Asia Pacific, we've been a player  flavors for a while and this is just an expansion. This is at about an hour a way from consumption. So we feel very good from a raw material perspective. We feel very good from an access to a big consumption base. And this will be very important for our customers. Our participation in Asia was limited to one plant for Flavors and about a handful of plants for animal nutrition. And we continue to build that position in animal nutrition. We feel very good about it. And then given this opportunity in flavors, we will enhance our capabilities, not just production, but also market development and probability for customer innovation centers. So you will see us going and putting more flags from the -- on the world in the developing areas. Whether it is Asia-Pacific or South-America, as we need to go and support our global customers. These are our customers that we do business every day here. And some of them are represented there, but also we have a lot of new local customers that are requiring these capabilities. So it's just a natural evolution of the business if you will. So let me clarify from an operating's perspective. We now going to be doing anything two these dry mills. So dry mills will produce ethanol. And then there is downstream technology and capabilities that Gevo brings to the table to transform them into SAS. But those two plants will continue to produce ethanol as they are. We are not planning to invest capital into that. Our contribution is those two plants, and then Gevo takes it from there, from a downstream perspective. Yeah. I would say, we expect a strong quarter for our services in this year. And you have to understand when sometimes at the end  the year it becomes complicated because they could be margin expansion, margin contraction here, and the accounting rules  according to Q1 and we need to respect that. What we're talking, what we can be determine from middle of October, which is today, is the fundamentals from the market, and demand is strong, and the export capacity it was tight starting into these. And we started to see our so we feel good about it. But again, it's difficult to call it sometimes Q4 versus Q1 because of the accounting rules and we can determine that now, we have to determine that at the end of the If you look at the Human Nutrition for the quarter, we grew revenue about 12%. I mean, it's actually a pretty good number, and I think, if you look at our EBITDA margin on sales, we were able to maintain that EBITDA margin on sales. So when you grow twice the industry clip, if you will, and you maintain margins, so I was pretty satisfied. Of course, it's not the spectacular maybe improvement year-over-year than Animal Nutrition have, but this is because Human Nutrition has been more stable and doing -- in animals, we're still going through the Neovia integration and all those things, but no, I don't think it was a weak quarter at all actually. Actually, I think as I said, we continue to grow maybe twice the industry rates and maintaining very robust EBITDA margins on sales. So EBITDA margins on sales for flavors are north of 20%. And we've been able to maintain despite You're seeing recovery in terms of the Food Service Sector. What -- when I look at Carbohydrate Solutions in total, non-HFCS is actually a very important component as well. And we've seen non-HFCS  pretty attractive with a good margin  side. And that's just reflective of really a strong demand environment for citric acid, for starches, for dextrose, and other products. So that's another important factor when you take a look  And look at Carbohydrate Solutions business in total for 2022. As I indicated earlier, we do think that the bio-fuel part of the business should be actually quite positive when you compare  year compared to this year. So when you put it all together, we do expect  solution to have another strong Yeah, Rob.  facility, and we feel very good about that business, actually. Specialty Ingredient Systems that we see in some of these new verticals. And both businesses are relatively new. They have almost no revenue  solutions for customers. We have a strong customer interest in these areas and everybody wants to  foundation. So at this point in time, soy is the main driver for us.  or a supplement or is different  perspective. It's not a big impact, so we haven't felt any impact in our plant at all. Thank you, Rob. This is a matter of where the expertise of each Company lies and, to be honest also, we want to be as asset life as possible. So in areas where LG is dominant and they're going to build that downstream capacity. When we think about value solutions, our objective , is to make , an ownership position and  we start making chemicals  application technology and all that, we cannot become a chemical Company. So in that, we let the partner, take  position. So we make corn grind plus one if you will, and then we let our partners take it from there. Which is a matter of optimized capital for us and not getting best scenario as where we are -- that are not coal for us. Coal areas for us will continue to be  within feed and beverages. When we go into these materials, if we're going to produce  that make sense, and then we have the partner doing the rest. Once we get the full details of the agreement, we'll see where the economics are setup and that would make sense to your investments will be in your target is trying to I'll say South America is always an issue with a little bit more factors in terms of farmer selling just because, although currency and under distortion that sometimes the government bring s into the  we continue to see maybe relatively slow farmer selling in Argentina and that will probably continue. It's been a little bit better in  in Brazil recently, but it's still relatively slow versus the accelerated pace at which they sold last year. I think that as we said, we are trying to and I think that you said we're trying to optimize our facilities and as such those facilities to demand that has more growth opportunity. In this issue, again, we don't want to go into making chemicals. That's a heavy capital intensive industry, and we want to make one derivative and then, reserve all that capital to continue to grow in food, feed, and beverages, and in health and wellness, that's what we're trying to do so LG Chem is a great partner. We're very honored to have them. They have very good technology and it's a little bit like the  discussions. We're going to continue to make ethanol, they will take it from there to make SAF. And with the -- with these partnerships, we're going to make lactic. They're going to take it from there to make PLA. So it's kind of a similar mindset. Listen, partial of that is correct. I mean, lactic it can go to many opportunities. But this is relatively early on  on the teams are looking at these. There is a lot -- there are a lot of numbers, there are a lot of things that could still change, there are a lot of discussions. So I wouldn't like to venture that much since the teams are still discussing with LG Chem and by 2050, 2060, 2040, whatever it is that these are they are looking back at their portfolio. They need to clean their portfolios, if you will. And one of the ways to do that is through recycling, the other way to do it is to go in plant-based. So we are receiving a lot of inbound request on that, and we're looking at our profits, our ability to produce plant-based products on our carbon capture and sequestration that provides an opportunity to make lower CI products. And we're trying to maximize the opportunity for ADM on all these. So some of these things may not be that well-defined because  that volume for the ADM shareholders. But it's a great opportunity for us and we will be mindful of returns and we not going to veer into areas that we shouldn't be putting capitals.  The capital will be reserved for our main thrust of the strategy, which is to continue to grow in food, and feed, and beverage. Thank you. Yeah. You're correct that Returns are important to us, but also dumping the volatility is in the mind of everything we do. So, of course, the team is considering that. I can't disclose that much at this early on. But I think what you need to also think is that over time, we will try to become a minority partner in all these. And the objective all these is to deconsolidate and take all those assets out of our participation. So to a certain degree, we're acting  owners long-term of this. That's why I talked before about  partners or financial partners. I think we're going to be able to deconsolidate. We're going to be able to monetize some amounts and if there is some upside to that, hopefully participate in all that. But you are correct. The objective is not to participate in One of the reasons, Eric, that we landed in this option is that the valuation of our assets, I mean, it's better than the alternatives that we have. So we are pleased with the value at which we are contributing these 2 assets. We don't need or we don't plan to add  as such, then the joint venture or Gevo may put money for finishing of the -- and to convert it into  through their technology. But our participation stops with the contribution of these 2 dry mills as they are. Thank you, Eric. Yeah. Listen, we have experienced in both the U.S. and the European Union a strong desire to make this a reality. There is no another efficient way to decarbonize the airlines industry -- the aviation industry. Of course, on the short hauls, you can put the , long hauls is something like this. So we expect the governments to be a partner, to a certain degree, in creating some of these markets. Some of those things are too early for me to disclose. But there are commitments both the U.S. government and the European Union to create a market for that in the 50 billion gallons type of size. So there's going to be some helping in to that. But that's probably to the extent that I can talk about it right now. We'll be headlining on December 10th, Global Investor Day. We look forward to talking in more detail projectory and why we are so optimistic about the opportunities ahead. In the meantime, as always, feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM."

            "content": "Yeah, thanks, Juan. Slide 6, please. The Ag Services in Oilseeds team continued their outstanding year with another quarter of substantial profit growth. In Ag Services, we're proud of how the team executed in a challenging environment, including a swift return to operation after Hurricane Ida. Overall results were significantly lower versus the prior year quarter, driven by approximately $50 million in net timing effects that should reverse in coming quarters, as well as $54 million in insurance settlement recorded in the prior year period and lower export volumes caused by Hurricane Ida. Global trade continues its strong performance. The crushing team delivered substantially higher year-over-year results executed well, delivering stronger margins in a dynamic environment that includes strong demand for vegetable oils to support our existing food customers, as well as the increasing production of renewable diesel. Results were also driven by about $70 million in net positive timing effects in the quarter. Refined products and other results were significantly higher than prior-year period driven by positive timing effects of approximately $80 million that are expected reverse in future quarters. Strong execution EMEA North America biodiesel, and strong refining premiums due to demand for renewable diesel, and food service recovery in North America also contributed to the results. Equity and earnings from Walmart were lower year-over-year. Now, looking ahead, we expect to see continued fundamental demand strength for egg service and oil seeds products, including from China, as well as solid global soybean crush margin environment in the Fourth Quarter. Partially offset by some higher manufacturing costs. In addition, RPO will be negatively impacted by timing reversals. All told, we expect results in the fourth quarter to be significantly higher than the third quarter of this year. Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate solution results were lower year-over-year. The starches and sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, showed their agility by managing through dynamic market conditions and optimizing mix between sweeteners and ethanol production through the quarter. Year-over-year results were significantly lower primarily due higher input cost. Vantage corn processor results were much higher versus the third quarter of 2020, supported by their resumption of production of -- at our 2 dry mills and improved fuel ethanol margins, particularly late in the quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the solid fundamentals from the end of the third quarter to continue for Carbohydrate Solutions with good ethanol margins extending through the quarter due to industry supply demand balance in solid demand for corn oil and starches, offset by higher manufacturing costs, particularly in Europe. As well as the absence of the Peoria dry mill. All told, fourth quarter results for the segment should be similar to the previous year fourth quarter. On Slide 8, the nutrition business remains on its solid growth trajectory with 17% higher revenues and 15% on a constant currency basis and 20% higher profits year-over-year in continued strong EBITDA margins. The Human Nutrition team delivered revenue growth of 12% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, helping to drive 9% higher profits. Higher volume, improved product mix for particular strength in beverage show strong flavor results in the  in North America, partially offset by lower results in APAC. Especially ingredients continued to benefit from strong demand for alternative proteins offset by some higher costs. Health and wellness results were higher on robust sales growth in bioactives and fiber. And nutrition profits were nearly  driven primarily by the strength in the mineral assets, as well as feed additives. Looking ahead. We expect nutrition to continue on its impressive growth path with strength across the human and animal nutrition, linked to strong year-over-year earnings expansion and a 20% full-year growth versus 2020. Slide 9, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the other segment, as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were substantially lower in the prior year period, driven primarily by captive insurance underwriting losses, most of which were offset by corresponding recoveries in the other business segments. We expect fourth quarter to have some additional insurance underwriting losses resulting in a break even other business for the Fourth Quarter. As expected, net interest expense for the quarter decreased year-over-year on lower interest rates, and a favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year. In the corporate lines, an allocate corporate costs of $230 million were driven primarily by higher IT offering and project-related costs into the centralized centers of  in supply chain and operations. Looking at total corporate costs,  in other corporate, we are still on track for the calendar year to be overall similar to 2020. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was approximately 18%. We anticipate our calendar-year adjusted effective tax rate to be the upper end of our previously communicated range of 14% to 16%, and potentially a bit higher depending upon the geographic mix in the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 26% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion. With that, I will turn it back to Juan. Hey, Ben. Good morning, Luke. No, you're right. We're vertically over in Europe. So that's a little bit of a headwind. At the same time, you are right and the ethanol margins that we're seeing right now in the market are extremely healthy. And that's just reflective above to fallen down to 20 million variables right now. And when you take a look at driving miles in gasoline demand, were sickly back to pre -pandemic levels of demand again. And so on the positive side, I would have to say the ethanol margins. On the issue of sweeteners and starches, what's interesting is while a lot of people focus on the HFCS guide the business, the other parts of our business are doing extremely well than the non - HFCS business. For example, citric acid demand is extremely strong, starches demand, extremely strong. So when we put it all together, that's why we provided the guidance that there are some puts and takes, but we expect our fourth quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions to be similar to where we were last year. Yeah, I mean, I think we haven't disclosed the amount of capital in terms of the LG Chem, I mean, that's still up -- being discussed right now in terms of how the partnership will form on lactic acid and polylactic acid. The access vial is not that significant. The big, big investment that you mentioned here is really the P4, the  investment, the  Company. And again, we decided to invest 75% into it, right? So therefore, I think we've managed that capital there. So the total invested capital on these recent announcement, actually, is far less than the billion dollars . This is consistent with the kind of the bolt-on type of investment numbers that we've talked about in the past, Ken. We expect  construction around that area. There probably is some transition. But as we look out over the next couple of years, we do expect that driving models are going to -- are coming back, we're seeing tight S&D right now in terms of our industry. We are seeing frankly the rest of the world is starting to recover from the pandemic. So we expect rest-of-world driving miles to start recovering. And so therefore, there is a lag in terms of recovery of exports of ethanol from U.S. to the rest of the world. So I think over the next couple of years, I think you're going to continue to see some level of demand recovery from outside the U.S. for ethanol, and then even China, as we talked about, I mean, they're focused on the environment, on energy. You could actually see China and  returning back to the markets. And we've seen a little bit of that already. Hey, Robert. It's Ray here. So the contracting season's underway, and we expect HFCS volumes and margins for EM to remain strong in 2022. Clearly, we did see some volatility in terms of corn prices. And that's -- Frankly, the input costs will get reflected in terms of our contract pricing. And we do expect contract pricing to be higher next year compared to this year. Volume-wise, we do expect volumes for '22 to be similar to what we've seen this year. I think that as we -- we've been monitoring commodity prices very carefully. And when you look in our offering working capital, right now it's still $2 billion higher than we were last year. So as we think about commodity prices next year, assuming you have a strong South America crop, you have a normal crop in U.S.. You see commodity prices coming off again. And after we've funded some of the bolt-on acquisitions that we've talked about, I expect our Balance Sheet to be pretty strong. And so there we can probably start looking back at return of capital that we've looked like in the pa st. So I think a lot of it is a function of funding the investments that we've talked about, but importantly, making sure that the working capital environment reverts back to normalized levels, which I think -- I sense, assuming a normal South America crop, a normal U.S. crop next year. I see opportunities to look at return of capital. Thank you, Adam."

I'm pleased to share with you results that continue to demonstrate our success in delivering strong and sustained earnings growth. This morning, we reported record second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.33. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, up 44% versus the second quarter of 2020. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.5 billion, almost $900 million more than a year ago. And I'm proud to report that our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.7%, which is both significantly higher than the 8.1% of the prior year period and also represents the achievement of our 10% objective. I'm proud of the entire ADM team for their great results this quarter. We're living up to our promises and our purpose. And the continuing execution of our strategy is delivering impressive ongoing growth for our company, our customers and our shareholders. I'd like to take a moment to highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter. Slide four, please. Over the last decade, we made cultural, technology and process changes that help us revolutionize how we do our work every day.\nRay Young: Yes. Thanks Juan and good morning everyone. Move to slide nine please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team followed up on their exceptional first quarter with another outstanding quarter. Ag Services results were higher year-over-year. The North American origination business delivered an outstanding second quarter, managing its positions effectively in a dynamic pricing environment and also achieved significantly higher export volumes, driven by corn sales to China. South American origination was significantly lower than the previous year's quarter driven by slower farmer selling and high commodity prices, which impacted contract fulfillment. Global trade performance was lower than the second -- strong second quarter of 2020 when customers were building inventories in mid-COVID-19. Results were also impacted by timing impacts that should reverse. Crushing had substantially higher year-over-year results. The business executed well in an environment of strong vegetable oil demand to deliver higher execution margins in North America soy and EU softseeds. Results were partially offset by weaker soybean crush margins in South America, driven by lower demand for biodiesel. In addition there were about $70 million in net incremental negative timing effects which should reverse in the coming quarters. Refined products and other results were significantly higher than the prior year period, driven by continued recovery in foodservice as well as positive timing effects in North America, partially offset by the effects of the reduction in the Brazilian biodiesel mandates. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher year-over-year. Now, looking ahead, we expect Q3 performance for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be higher than the third quarter of 2020, driven by stronger results in crushing. We continue to anticipate full year results that will be significantly higher than 2020's very strong performance. Slide 10 please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team did a great job delivering results that were almost double those of the prior year period. Starches and Sweeteners, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered substantially higher year-over-year results in a highly dynamic pricing environment, driven by about $90 million in positioning gains across the ethanol complex, as well as more normalized results from corn oil. Sweetener volumes were higher reflecting the beginnings of a recovery in demand from the foodservice channel. Ethanol margins improved versus the prior year period driven by a resurgence in driving miles in the United States.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ray. Slide 13 please. When I look back on our outstanding first half results following a record 2020, I see a team that is executing at a high level and a strategy that is delivering according to our plan. We have been constantly refreshing our portfolio, divesting from non-strategic businesses and redeploying capital consistent with our strategy. In doing so, we've built industry-leading capabilities to meet customer and consumer needs in high-growth categories such as meat alternatives, a category we expect to reach more than $100 billion in sales worldwide by 2030 and in which our PlantPlus Foods joint venture, now is participating, selling consumer products across Brazil and ready in its North American launch. Another example is dietary supplements, a segment on track to have $80 billion in sales globally by 2025; and in which we're constantly expanding our product portfolio including our recently introduced Bio-Kult Brighten, which includes ingredients to reduce tiredness and fatigue. And then there is pet food, which is forecast to grow to more than $130 billion globally by 2025 and an area in which we launched our new premium cat food in Mexico, earlier this year. The list goes on. Renewable green diesel, pharmaceuticals and personal care, beverages all large high-growth opportunities powered by macro consumer trends like sustainability and health and wellbeing. And in each of those segments and more, our unparalleled global footprint, fully integrated value chain, customer insight, broad portfolio and speed to market are setting us ahead of the competition and fueling our growth. That's why, we are so optimistic about our path forward. Of course, there are always going to be short-term factors for us to navigate. But those are not things that will impact our long-term success. Our confidence is rooted in the transformation we began a decade ago and which continues with our work in productivity and innovation, as well as our expanding participation in large and fast-growing market opportunities. So to conclude, we have a great start of the year and we expect to continue our momentum, in the second half to deliver very strong 2021 earnings. As we've discussed, we are moving to a new phase of our strategic growth plan. With what we have accomplished over the years on capital discipline targeted cost reductions and cash generation and moving through our portfolio transformation and our efforts to optimize business performance, drive efficiencies and expand strategically. I believe, we have successfully increased our base earnings power from $3 a share back in 2015 to a range of $4 to $4.50 this year. And now, as we enter the next stage of our growth leveraging the key macro trends of food security health and well-being and sustainability with our continued focus on productivity and innovation and with future targeted investments, we believe our medium-term ,annual earnings trend growth rate will be in the high single-digit percentages from these $4 to $4.50 per share baseline. With that operator please open the line for questions. \nOperator:  Your first question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. \nAdam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. \nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Adam.\nRay Young: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson : I want -- maybe just something you just mentioned in the prepared remarks the $4 to $4.50 baseline of EPS this year and the high single-digit growth thereafter just to be clear is that -- should we take that as a reasonably formal EPS range for 2021 just given the performance year-to-date? I just want to clarify just, how we're framing that. \nJuan Luciano: Yes, Adam. Listen, when we were -- when we put together the previous phase of the strategy, we were looking at growing as I said before from $3 to land in the $4 to $4.50 area and achieve 10% ROIC. As we started to see those goals in sight, we started on the development of the new phase of the strategy. So we took that base of $4 to $4.50 and we created a five-year plan. When we put together that plan, with all these opportunities that I highlighted and focused on productivity and innovation, that plan shows that from that base of $4 to $4.50 will grow over the next five years at the rate of high single-digit growth per year. So that's what we said in the -- at the outlook. Hello? Are we still on the line?\nAdam Samuelson: I'm sorry. And then, just a market macro question, if I may. Just, we've seen some volatility in oilseed crush margins around the world of late. It seems like, especially, in China, the soy meal demand has waned a little bit, with the wheat substitution and it seems like the global industry is really crushing for veg oil, given all the RD demand around the world. Can you just help us think about kind of how that rolls forward, as we think, especially with -- for you more heavily weighted towards soybeans and some pressure in terms of softseed crop availability on the oil side, as we go through the balance of the year and into 2022?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Adam. So, listen, we are very optimistic about the prospects for crush for the rest of the year and into next year. And if I go by geography, as I always do, from a North American perspective, margin remains exceptionally strong in North America in the $45 to $50 range. As you said, with a strong vegetable oil demand, in part driven by RGD, but we had already a very good oil demand and we see more recovery of our foodservices and more reopening of the economy. And that continues to enhance, of course, the oil share of the crush contribution. And also, the tightening supplies and logistical issues in South America are allowing also U.S. soybean meal to be a little bit more competitive in global markets. We see some compression in European soy margins, maybe to $10 to $20, as prices basically from South America oil imports are pressuring crush margins, especially this is the time of the year in which Argentina and Brazil are the most competitive. They are in the middle of the harvest. And of course they have reduced their biodiesel mandate, so there is more oil exportable, if you will. Although, the beauty of our long supply chain is that, as crush margins have softened in Europe, we got the benefit in biodiesel and the RPV given that. Brazil margins continue to remain solid for domestic plants, with maybe $25 to $35, despite the B10 biodiesel situation. And they are expected to remain solid as they move to higher B12 blend rates in the future starting I think in September. China margins are low due to high bean prices and lower soybean in demand. The herd is going through a rebalance there. And at the moment, there is a lot of wheat feed being fed. And -- but we're going to go through the harvest of wheat. And I think that's something that we see with optimism going forward is that, if you look at all the substitutes that we were facing last year whether it was sorghum or canola or sun or wheat, they have increased their inclusion in the Russians. And now all those things are having either weather issues or which is going to go through the harvest. So we see now the ability of soybean meal and corn inclusions to go up and that's positive as we go forward. As you mentioned on our watch list is canola margins. They have weakened. They were very strong in the first -- during the first half and -- but they have weakened on concern of a short drop, driven by the dryness in Canada. And canola margins are probably going to remain volatile until there is more certainty around the Canadian crop side. So two factors that we feel good about here is how valuable our switch capacity is, in this dynamic environment margins have shifted. And also how important it is our integration our long value chain. If you think North America today is capturing it in crush and maybe less so in biodiesel in Europe, we don't capture that much in crush, but we capture it in biodiesel. So, all this ability of our footprint to allow us to follow the margin, as it moves through the value chain has been very, very beneficial in these very volatile times.\nAdam Samuelson: That's incredibly helpful color. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on.\nJuan Luciano: Adam, maybe on the first question that you mentioned, again, the $4 to $4.50, as I said before, just to clarify, is our baseline in which we ran the exercise, because that was the landing spot of our previous strategy. And it's not a forecast or guidance for this year.\nAdam Samuelson: Got it, that's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ben.\nRay Young: Hi Ben. Ben, are you on the line?\nOperator: We'll go to the next questioner. Your next question is from Luke Washer of Bank of America.\nLuke Washer: Hi. Good morning.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Luke.\nRay Young: Good morning, Luke.\nLuke Washer: So, I wanted to ask you a few quick questions on your carbon capture projects. I think they're really interesting. Are you getting any 45Q tax credits, for the implementation of that technology? And now that it appears that it's commercially viable, do you intend to start the permitting process or working with other partners to build out and start capturing carbon at some of the other plants?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. So the answer is, yes, to both. So we have a big permit for Decatur that we plan to of course leverage. And then, yes, we are exploring our ability to do so for other plants. We've been doing this relatively quietly, Luke since 2017. And as I said before, we have stored more than 3.5 million tons, safely underground. And this gives us the ability to start differentiating our products that we can assign some of the credits to some of these products and have those products be deemed low-carbon intensity product. So we have again, a big experience. We've been doing this for four years, in two different facilities. And we feel very good about the future. And this is going to be a growing part of our operations, for sure.\nLuke Washer: And maybe just a quick follow-up on that, it -- this does lower the carbon score -- the carbon -- the CI scores of your plants, right?\nJuan Luciano: That's correct.\nLuke Washer: Okay.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah.\nLuke Washer: Okay, great. And then, maybe just a more short-term question on Carb Solutions, it looks like you really did well this quarter, particularly relative to expectations earlier this year. So can you talk through the -- I guess, the delta in your expectations and how things progress through the quarter? And maybe talk through the $90 million in positioning gains that you had? And then, you also talked about normalized results for corn oil. Corn oil prices are really high right now. So are you saying that that is a bit of a new normal, because of renewable diesel? Any other color there would be great.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Let me tell you why -- what -- one better if you will, as per your question. I think that this was the quarter that we needed to restart the ethanol dry mills that we have taken down, due to lack of demand. And we have from a technical perspective the perfect start-up. And certainly, they hit the ground with better margins than maybe we anticipated before bringing them up. Second, as we explained before, we have very good risk management that the team positioned very well on corn and on the ethanol complex. And certainly sweeteners volumes came back versus last year, as customers were preparing for the summer. And to a certain degree you might have to take both Q2 and Q3 together from a sweetener perspective, because I think that a lot of customers bought in anticipation of refilling their pipeline given the summer and the openness with COVID that we will go into experience in the U.S. So it was a strong volume month as well.\nRay Young: It's going to -- on your question on corn oil, we've seen convergence of corn oil with soybean oil again. Recall last year, we saw a divergence because of the snack foods people staying at home high demand for corn oil, which is used for frying that caused corn oil prices to move up dramatically and it diverged from soybean oil and that's what's caused a lot of the mark-to-market issues that we had last year. We've worked through all those issues over the course of the period. We're actually seeing right now corn oil and soybean oil really converging. And so we're turning back to, let's say, the normal relationship that we've seen in the past.\nLuke Washer: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.\nKen Zaslow: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nRay Young: Hi, Ken.\nJuan Luciano: Hi, Ken. Good morning.\nKen Zaslow: You keep on tempting us with this productivity and innovation. Can you put some color in terms of quantification on how much this is going to create in not just 2021, but beyond that and how do you frame those two opportunities? \nJuan Luciano: Yes. Ken, I would say, if you look at our past what we have been doing over the last five years probably -- and if you think about translating everything we've done in productivity and innovation we were probably two-third in productivity and one-third in innovation if you will of all the savings we were getting. As we look at as I said before at our plan going forward, the contribution between productivity and innovation is equal. It's about 50-50. And it's mainly driven by all these opportunities that I mentioned not only nutrition, but all the other things that we're seeing whether it's biomaterials or renewable green diesel and all the other things that we've done. Again, when we look at our plan, when we start from this again theoretical $4 to $4.50 range and we apply all these projects that are included in productivity and innovation we see our program over the next five years growing in the high single-digit percentage every year in operating profit. So we feel very good about that. We will be having Ken in Q4 an Investor Day where we will be disclosing much more details and much more granularity about all these. But you can see some of the things that we're doing already whether we are invested in Spiritwood or the acquisition of Sojaprotein or the expansions of our plant in Valencia with Biopolis and microbiome. So all these areas are receiving organic growth dollars. This will be -- as we go forward Ken and you look at this plan this is more an investment plan than maybe the previous period was. So you will see a little bit more CapEx and a little bit more investment given the size of the opportunities. When I was mentioning some of the sizes of these addressable markets we have if you added some of the things I was saying these are markets north of $300 billion in which we have positioned ourselves very, very well and we think that we're going to capture a nice share of those. So the opportunity ahead of us is significant. \nKen Zaslow: Let me just follow on. When you're thinking about the high single-digit growth rate to what extent do you think that is associated with the improvement in -- or the structural improvement in RD over the next couple of years? And how much of that is internally creative?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Let me say, when I look at the three businesses and we move them forward through the five years we see Ag Services and Oilseeds growth moderately, but it grows. We see Carb Solutions being flat to slightly declining in our forecasting. And then we see a strong growth in Nutrition. That's kind of the -- if you will the algorithm of how the business has moved. The Ag Services and Oilseeds part -- part of that has been our own improvement, part of that has been the industry. There has been some consolidations and the industry margins are strong. And there has been a strong demand and we trust that there's going to continue to be a strong demand. There are 400 million people in the middle class in China that are consuming very much like US type of consumer. And that's driving health and wellness, that's driving improving diets. And then there is sustainability that is driving a lot of the things that we're doing, not only RGD, because remember that before RGD, we were already having a very tight oil market based on food, on food oil. So, I think part is our structural issues and part is our own improvements that we have done over these years.\nKen Zaslow: Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.\nMichael Piken: Yes. Good morning. Maybe we can dive a little bit deeper into Nutrition, and it seems like that's a good chunk of where the increase came from. But maybe this 20% growth rate, should we expect for 2022 to expect 15% year-on-year growth from -- on top of this 20% level? And then also, what categories are you seeing the most growth in besides plant protein? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Michael, listen, when we look forward on Nutrition. Nutrition is going to grow somewhere in that range, between 15% and 20%. So, we said, 15% this year and half into the year we have moved into 20%. So, something in that range. The business is going very strong. We've been able to grow that revenue during this quarter and we've been able to maintain margins, which it has been a very good job of controlling gross margins and EBITDA margin on sales. Our enthusiasm is not only for the categories in which we are positioned, but also on the win rates and the customer engagement. Our customer engagement as of -- in 2021 have doubled our customer engagement last year. And as the economy is reopening and foodservice become more active, customers are more willing to launch new promotions and new products, something that they were not doing before. So, we see that acceleration, whether it's in beverages or in health and wellness or alternative proteins. So again, I think you should think conservatively 15% per year; more aggressively 20% per year. But in that range, we will be growing over the next few years.\nMichael Piken: Great. And then, a follow-up question just shifting gears. Could you talk about the impact of the recent kind of Supreme Court ruling? And there's been some talks about possible changes to the renewable fuel standard. Maybe your thoughts on the growth potential or lack thereof for the US ethanol market moving forward in light of some of these policy uncertainties? Thanks.\nRay Young: Yes, Mike. Yes, there's been a lot of news regarding the recent Supreme Court ruling and some of the comments from the EPA. When you kind of cut through all the headlines, and try to understand like what's fundamentally happening, we still believe the Biden administration and the EPA is committed to fighting climate change and also decarbonizing the economy. And biofuels, frankly, is in a very important part of that agenda. So, the Biden administration has made it very clear that they don't intend to grant SREs or these small refinery exemptions like in the prior administrations. And as President Biden himself has said, he said that we should be insisting not exempting. So, we do expect the Biden EPA to take a very balanced approach towards granting future SREs. So, when you look at supply-demand balances going forward and you take a look at the RINs balances and you think about the recovery of driving miles as we move through the pandemic, our expectation is looking at supply/demand for ethanol -- for gasoline and then which translates to ethanol, we believe that it is going to result in a reasonably constructive ethanol environment for the industry over the medium-term. Now, at the same time, Mike it is important to note that in the case of our -- we've made a strategic decision to monetize our dry mills. And so, we kind of halted that process during the pandemic frankly, because ethanol demand was very weak. But during that period, we did look at alternatives. We took advantage to, frankly, explore other options. And there's -- frankly, as Juan talked about on the issue of sustainability, there's growing interest in sustainable materials and sustainable solutions. And it appears that there may be some opportunities for us to explore non-vehicle uses of ethanol and leveraging ethanol as a sustainable feedstock for other products. And so one of the promising areas is the Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF. With the airline industry moving towards effectively a low-carbon or a net-zero future, SAF appears to be an important component of how they will get there. And just for perspective, the US airline industry before the pandemic consumed 30 billion gallons of aviation fuel a year. So we are looking at the possibility of leveraging our Decatur carbon sequestration site, which Juan talked about, with our corn processing output as a feedstock for SAF to get towards a low-carbon SAF product. So in addition to looking at potential monetization of dry mills, we are looking at the SAF concept, which frankly may give us another option for finding another use of the dry mills and then taking those ethanol gallons off the vehicle market.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Simonitsch of JPMorgan.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Tom.\nTom Simonitsch: Good morning, everyone. Hi. So following up on the Sojaprotein acquisition yesterday, can you provide some more color around how your strategy for alternative proteins varies by region?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I think that the strategy in specialty proteins is stay close to our customers and match up with capabilities and supply this market that is growing very fast. The market is growing north of 10% per year. So \u2013 and it's moving fast in terms of the products. The products are continued to be improved every quarter. So we have a strong position in North America, our heritage position in soy derivatives. Then we build our position in South America, which is very strong. I remind you that that was $0.25 billion investment so significant. Then we build pea protein capacity in North Dakota. And now we're expanding that capacity to Europe. We have a small capacity in Europe. Now with this, we have bought \u2013 we have acquired the largest producer in Europe, which again has a great footprint of \u2013 in the middle of the non-GMO soybean harvest area but also it has a very nice set of products and they sell to 65 different countries in many, many applications. So we continue to build the capabilities. This will not be the last one that you're going to hear in terms of announcements for specialty protein. Again, this is \u2013 these are early days but it's a fast-growing market in which we have a leadership position and we pretend to \u2013 we intend to expand.\nTom Simonitsch: That's helpful. And a question on China. The USDA cut its China soybean import forecast this month. What are you assuming for that trade in the near to medium term? And how would it impact your crushing footprint?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Listen, I think that we are maybe more optimistic about China medium-term than maybe with the news are giving right now. China has done an exceptional job of controlling COVID. And as such, they have recovered from that very successfully. So there is a lot of economic activity and hence demand. They have done a terrific job in coming back from the ASF pandemic. They have recovered. So they have the consumer and they have the animals to actually consume. Of course, they are very strategic in their purchases. And right now, it's not the time to be buying a lot of beans because beans are expensive and there is a crop in the US coming. And we think that that's where \u2013 when they're going to come. You also have to remember a couple of things, Tom. Over the last two or three weeks, we lost 15 million tons of production around the world due to weather issues. Whether it was the drought in Canada with \u2013 that impacted canola and wheat, whether it was Russia, whether it was the impact was on sand and in wheat and whether it was the corn crop in Brazil because of drought, all these products are competitive products in the Russian to soybean meal. So those products will not be available to compete with soybean meal which will give soybean meal a higher inclusion in the ration. And in our estimate given the small canola crop in Canada, we think that China will have to probably import 2 million tons of extra soybean -- soybeans to offset that canola gap that they have right now. So all in all we feel that we're still going to have strong exports -- export volumes in the Q4 of this year from North America. \nTom Simonitsch: Thanks very much. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Your next question is from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. \nRobert Moskow: Good morning. I had a question about the new earnings base that you're putting out there. Historically external factors can change quickly and can have a big impact on your earnings. And I want to know, what do we have to believe about the external environment to feel comfort that the earnings base is credible that it can -- that you can achieve -- that the earnings base is achievable under a variety of different external environments. \nJuan Luciano: Yes. Rob, the way we thought about it when we put together the plan is and I think I expressed some of that before is of course we look at the things that we can see into the future. You can argue the magnitude but we give our forecast forward and we add inflation to that. And we say some of these things may come back to the middle if you will or reverse to the means or whatever you want to call it. So, let's put the negative side there. So, we consider some of that. And then we look at our productivity and innovation and we said, can we build a robust enough agenda in productivity and innovation that actually can offset some of those headwinds whether they are headwinds on ethanol or whether they are whatever your favorite crush margin into the future or whether it's inflation? And we look at that and the result of that exercise is that productivity and innovation earnings stream coming forward offset all that potential decline that we have estimated and offset it and giving us a result that high single-digit growth rate in profits over the next five years. So that's the way we think about it. So this is not a scenario in which everything goes perfect and margins are at peak level for five years. In our scenario margins normalize we have inflation and then we are able to offset a lot of that through growth and through productivity. That's what we are saying in terms of our new base. \nRobert Moskow: Right. And in terms of things that are going to normalize carbohydrates would be the first -- the most -- the biggest degree of normalization because it looks like it's going to earn $1 billion this year?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I would say, maybe when I was answering Ken I think when we look at the three businesses, Nutrition provides a lot of the growth in that scenario of course. You have to remember, when we started reporting Nutrition yearly they were reporting about $300-and-something million. This quarter they crossed the barrier of $200 million. So now -- so it's significant. And you will see that in crescendo of course over the next few years as we reach $1 billion and beyond. Carb Solutions as you said is -- it basically declines over the period. And then we have a healthy, but not exuberant growth rate for Ag Services and Oilseeds. So all in all, when you look at our numbers it doesn't look a far-fetched scenario. On the contrary it's a scenario that we're very confident that's why we are making it public today. And a lot of things under our control to be honest. \nRobert Moskow: And last question. You said that there's been consolidation in the soy crush industry and that is part of the reason for your confidence. But you are opening up a new crush plant now. Can you give a little more color about how much consolidation there's been? What do you think crush capacity looks like today compared to a few years ago? And where do you think it's going in the next few years from an industry perspective?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Listen I think that there has been consolidation in the small regional players, which has been important. We have the example of Algar in Brazil. We also did the soybean joint venture with Cargill in Egypt. So -- and there have been others around the industry. I think it's important to notice that we've been working in this expansion, the Spiritwood for the last two years. We just announced it now. But this is capacity that, of course, this one is helped by RGD. But when you think about soybean meal in North America, we need about two to three -- to offset -- 2% to 3% growth in demand every year. So we need a full-time full-fledged plant every couple of years just to keep up with demand and to be able to supply the growth. So we don't think that any of these build is excessive. On the contrary, we think that it's needed to allow demand to be fulfilled.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: In the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question. Again, please limit yourself to one question Your next question is from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\nBen Theurer: Great. Good morning, Juan, Ray, now we try it again. Thank you very much, and congrats on the results.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning Ben.\nRay Young: Morning Ben.\nBen Theurer: Just one question. If you could elaborate a little bit on those $90 million on positioning gains across ethanol and what's been driving that throughout the quarter. And is that something you think is something recurring, is this a one-off? How should we think about it because it was obviously sizable within the segment? Thank you.\nRay Young: Yeah, Ben. I mean our team\u2019s do an excellent job managing risk, right? And when you just talk about managing risk is both managing the risks of the inputs and the outputs. And so the positioning gains that we had in the quarter, in the second quarter, the $90 million it's a combination of what I call the ethanol complex, right? So it's a combination of how they're managing the corn, how they're managing ethanol, how they're managing RINs, all these positions. And as you know it was a very volatile quarter when you looked at the prices of corn and ethanol and RINs but they managed exceptionally well. And so $90 million normally they would generate risk management gains. We highlighted it this quarter because this was an exceptional quarter. And by the way it wasn't just an exceptional quarter. It was an exceptional first half of the year, because when you take a look at the first half of the year, they probably had positioning gains roughly with a similar amount in the first quarter as well. So, therefore, the Carb Solutions team really hit all of the ballpark in terms of risk management in the first half of this year.\nBen Theurer: So for the future we should expect some of it, but maybe not at the same magnitude. That's a fair assumption? \nRay Young: Yeah. I mean, again I mean I would never ask the Carb Solutions team to hold back. But again they will always manage their positions exceedingly well. And I would say this was probably an exceptional performance for the first half of the year.\nBen Theurer: Okay, perfect. I\u2019ll leave it here. Thank you very much for squeezing me in again.\nRay Young: Thank you Ben.\nOperator: Your next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.\nSteve Haynes: Hi. This is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Maybe I could just squeeze a quick one in on the biosolutions business portfolio. You talked about some of the other growth things. And you've announced -- you've made some announcements already in terms of some partnerships and agreements. But can you I guess maybe just help us think about going forward where your any specific target growth areas would be within that business?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Listen that is a business that to a certain degree started from a customer pool. We discovered one day that a lot of the products that we were selling in Carb Solutions were finding their way into non-food applications, non-beverage application. So now we have started with a new team on a more proactive approach to that. So we have a market based approach where we're targeting things like construction and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and other products. And we've been very successful. This team has been growing \u2013 they have been growing sales about 10 \u2013 at the 10% click. These are very profitable opportunities and opportunities that at this point in time require no capital, because these are existing products going into new applications. So we have hired experts, marketing experts, and technical experts to be able to sell these into new applications. And we fill in an incredible customer pool. Every CEO or company out there that is announcing this de-carbonization goal's for 2040 or whatever needs to shift to plant-based materials from oil based in order to de-carbonize. And we are the largest company in that space with the ability to provide the broadest footprint of products. So you will continue to see growth there, and we are just getting started. That will be my comment. We cannot talk a lot about \u2013 as you can understand about our customer engagement, because these are confidential agreements that we have and a lot of these the customers don't want to disclose what they are doing.\nSteve Haynes: All right. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ben Kallo of Baird.\nBen Kallo: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. The first one is just on South America gross margin. Could you just talk about, if there's a structural change or is it just a temporary change as it relates to biodiesel headwinds? And then the second question is on M&A. I know you just did a deal so congratulations on that. But on larger acquisition front from your experience one as \u2013 are there targets out there? And then two, is it easier for the heavy lifting of integration to do a large acquisition than the smaller tuck-in ones like you announced yesterday? Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Ben. So let me address South America first. So, of course, our bigger participation is Brazil. It has been a tough year for Brazil this first half of the year in general. We expect second half of the year to have the possibility to be a little better. Biodiesel is B12 now and that has been confirmed. We'll have to see the first auctions there. So crush margins are better. Domestic margins are $25 to $30 per ton export is about $10. Bottle oil and volumes and prices are better in the last two months. We started the year tough there. Remember that, this is a society that is going through the tougher parts of COVID. So demand is difficult there. But we have seen an improvement. Domestic meal the market is also paying for the higher soybeans. So that's good. We have \u2013 Brazil has reduced exports of corn of course, because of the drought. But the domestic market is paying the premium. So Brazil is not going to run out of corn, and it's importing a little bit from Brazil. So I would say in general with oil \u2013 domestic oil being supported and the volumes being there and with biodiesel going back to B12, we expect the second half of the year to be a little bit better than maybe what the first half was.\nBen Kallo: And then the second question on M&A, just on targets and appetite for a larger deal and then the integration of smaller deals versus many smaller deals versus the large ones?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. You know that, we've been relatively quiet. We continue to be very selective about this because valuations are in general for some properties are a little bit too high. So it \u2013 this needs to be a perfect fit into our portfolio. And the perfect combination of things with Sojaprotein is in terms of the footprint, the complementarily of the geographic nature of it and the quality of management, and the assets and the products. In terms of what is easier to integrate, I think that sometimes bolt-ons are a little bit easier. We find they fit better in a business that is already structured. When you bring a large company you need more adjustments on both sides if you will, if you think about some of these companies that have continued to operate in ADM almost like with the same agility they were operating before, whether you say Protexin or Biopolis and some of these companies. So I think that the smaller companies are probably an easy tuck-in than maybe large companies. Large companies take us a little bit longer. \nBen Kallo: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano : You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens.\nBen Bienvenu: Hi. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I appreciate you squeezing me in.\nJuan Luciano : Hi, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: One quick one from me. You talked about the operational flexibility to shift and flex between softseed crushing and oilseed crushing. When you think about the backdrop for oilseed crushing margins across all your geographies, but in North America in particular where things are quite strong, those strong driven by soybean oil this go around, do you think the market is able to digest appropriately switching from a higher oil yield to a higher meal yield given the kind of relative softness in the meal market? And just how do you think about toggling between those two crush capacities in a market like this?\nJuan Luciano: Listen at this point in time, we are seeing good demand for both products. So, of course, as you know, there is a big pull from oil. There has been a big pull for oil. And then RGD is increasing a little bit of that, but our ability to place the mill given our footprint and our commercial operations is very strong. So that gives us a lot of confidence for North America for the second half. Listen let me be clear. The Oilseeds and Ag Services business will have a very strong year much better than last year and we expect a strong second half as well that will drive the company to earnings that we never had before certainly. And certainly, we'll be probably on the higher side or maybe outside the range of 4 to 4.50 that I mentioned before that was the previous landing spot of our strategy. That's what we're seeing at the moment. So the year started strong and we think that the second half will be very strong. Okay. Very good. Thank you Juan and best of luck in the back half.\nOperator: Your final question is from Eric Larson of Seaport Research Partners.\nEric Larson: Yes. Good morning everyone. I hope everybody is doing well.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Eric.\nRay Young: Thank you, Eric.\nEric Larson: So, on the -- I know we're short on time, I'll make this question pretty quick and pretty direct. It's really going back I think a little to maybe Adam's first question, maybe drilling down on some demand functions here in the near term. Obviously, you've addressed the global biodiesel markets, what's going on there the US ethanol all the job owning of RFS and all that stuff. But people are talking about some chinks in the armor in some of the Chinese demand at least in the near term. They've walked away from a little bit of corn imports in July, which has bought a thimbleful, and I think it spooked the market. But I think the real issue here is ASF in China -- have they had a major setback in that? And we just don't know what to kind of believe what's coming out of there. And now you've had the floods in China that's impacted about 10% of their growing area has killed a lot of hogs. Is that -- is some of the near-term demand function a piece of the Chinese AFS problems that they're having? \nJuan Luciano: I think that, of course, as you described, there are many issues going on and there is a little bit of a transition here. But the reality is that pork prices have come down, that will incentivate demand. But you also need to understand that, in the -- during the ASF, people get to eat more poultry as well. And we have seen that demand growth. We think that when we have a better supply and cheaper supply of soybeans, things will come back a little bit more to normal. When we check with our customers over there, fundamentally, nothing has changed. And if you look at the -- as I said the middle class in China and you look at the indicators of that, which is the consumption of the big four protein, they are all higher than prepandemic levels. So the consumer is there, the animals are there to be fed. And I think that the rest is just a matter of tactical approaches, whether we had the big run-up in hog prices in China, then the government intervened to try to control that. Now they are lower. They said more wheat. I think that's going to shift to include more soybean in the portfolio -- in the inclusion. So, we think that at the end of the day, there may be many monthly gyrations, but over time, protein consumption continues to go up and they will import more soybeans to actually satisfy that demand. So, we feel very confident about the future of the demand in China.\nVikram Luthar: Thanks. We do seriously have reached the queues. We have small issues throughout the areas and they have to supplement it with meals at some point. So, thank you, everybody for sharing.\nOperator: There are no other questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Luthar for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nVikram Luthar: Thank you. Slide 14 notes upcoming investor events in which we will be participating. As Juan has already mentioned in the Q&A, we'd also like to announce that we will be hosting a Global Investor Day in the fourth quarter of this year, during which we will be talking more about the next phase of our growth. More particulars, including the specific date and format will be forthcoming. As always please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Vikram. I'm pleased to share with you results that continue to demonstrate our success in delivering strong and sustained earnings growth. This morning, we reported record second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.33. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, up 44% versus the second quarter of 2020. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.5 billion, almost $900 million more than a year ago. And I'm proud to report that our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.7%, which is both significantly higher than the 8.1% of the prior year period and also represents the achievement of our 10% objective. I'm proud of the entire ADM team for their great results this quarter. We're living up to our promises and our purpose. And the continuing execution of our strategy is delivering impressive ongoing growth for our company, our customers and our shareholders. I'd like to take a moment to highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter. Slide four, please. Over the last decade, we made cultural, technology and process changes that help us revolutionize how we do our work every day. Thank you, Ray. Slide 13 please. When I look back on our outstanding first half results following a record 2020, I see a team that is executing at a high level and a strategy that is delivering according to our plan. We have been constantly refreshing our portfolio, divesting from non-strategic businesses and redeploying capital consistent with our strategy. In doing so, we've built industry-leading capabilities to meet customer and consumer needs in high-growth categories such as meat alternatives, a category we expect to reach more than $100 billion in sales worldwide by 2030 and in which our PlantPlus Foods joint venture, now is participating, selling consumer products across Brazil and ready in its North American launch. Another example is dietary supplements, a segment on track to have $80 billion in sales globally by 2025; and in which we're constantly expanding our product portfolio including our recently introduced Bio-Kult Brighten, which includes ingredients to reduce tiredness and fatigue. And then there is pet food, which is forecast to grow to more than $130 billion globally by 2025 and an area in which we launched our new premium cat food in Mexico, earlier this year. The list goes on. Renewable green diesel, pharmaceuticals and personal care, beverages all large high-growth opportunities powered by macro consumer trends like sustainability and health and wellbeing. And in each of those segments and more, our unparalleled global footprint, fully integrated value chain, customer insight, broad portfolio and speed to market are setting us ahead of the competition and fueling our growth. That's why, we are so optimistic about our path forward. Of course, there are always going to be short-term factors for us to navigate. But those are not things that will impact our long-term success. Our confidence is rooted in the transformation we began a decade ago and which continues with our work in productivity and innovation, as well as our expanding participation in large and fast-growing market opportunities. So to conclude, we have a great start of the year and we expect to continue our momentum, in the second half to deliver very strong 2021 earnings. As we've discussed, we are moving to a new phase of our strategic growth plan. With what we have accomplished over the years on capital discipline targeted cost reductions and cash generation and moving through our portfolio transformation and our efforts to optimize business performance, drive efficiencies and expand strategically. I believe, we have successfully increased our base earnings power from $3 a share back in 2015 to a range of $4 to $4.50 this year. And now, as we enter the next stage of our growth leveraging the key macro trends of food security health and well-being and sustainability with our continued focus on productivity and innovation and with future targeted investments, we believe our medium-term ,annual earnings trend growth rate will be in the high single-digit percentages from these $4 to $4.50 per share baseline. With that operator please open the line for questions. Good morning, Adam. Yes, Adam. Listen, when we were -- when we put together the previous phase of the strategy, we were looking at growing as I said before from $3 to land in the $4 to $4.50 area and achieve 10% ROIC. As we started to see those goals in sight, we started on the development of the new phase of the strategy. So we took that base of $4 to $4.50 and we created a five-year plan. When we put together that plan, with all these opportunities that I highlighted and focused on productivity and innovation, that plan shows that from that base of $4 to $4.50 will grow over the next five years at the rate of high single-digit growth per year. So that's what we said in the -- at the outlook. Hello? Are we still on the line? Yes. Thank you, Adam. So, listen, we are very optimistic about the prospects for crush for the rest of the year and into next year. And if I go by geography, as I always do, from a North American perspective, margin remains exceptionally strong in North America in the $45 to $50 range. As you said, with a strong vegetable oil demand, in part driven by RGD, but we had already a very good oil demand and we see more recovery of our foodservices and more reopening of the economy. And that continues to enhance, of course, the oil share of the crush contribution. And also, the tightening supplies and logistical issues in South America are allowing also U.S. soybean meal to be a little bit more competitive in global markets. We see some compression in European soy margins, maybe to $10 to $20, as prices basically from South America oil imports are pressuring crush margins, especially this is the time of the year in which Argentina and Brazil are the most competitive. They are in the middle of the harvest. And of course they have reduced their biodiesel mandate, so there is more oil exportable, if you will. Although, the beauty of our long supply chain is that, as crush margins have softened in Europe, we got the benefit in biodiesel and the RPV given that. Brazil margins continue to remain solid for domestic plants, with maybe $25 to $35, despite the B10 biodiesel situation. And they are expected to remain solid as they move to higher B12 blend rates in the future starting I think in September. China margins are low due to high bean prices and lower soybean in demand. The herd is going through a rebalance there. And at the moment, there is a lot of wheat feed being fed. And -- but we're going to go through the harvest of wheat. And I think that's something that we see with optimism going forward is that, if you look at all the substitutes that we were facing last year whether it was sorghum or canola or sun or wheat, they have increased their inclusion in the Russians. And now all those things are having either weather issues or which is going to go through the harvest. So we see now the ability of soybean meal and corn inclusions to go up and that's positive as we go forward. As you mentioned on our watch list is canola margins. They have weakened. They were very strong in the first -- during the first half and -- but they have weakened on concern of a short drop, driven by the dryness in Canada. And canola margins are probably going to remain volatile until there is more certainty around the Canadian crop side. So two factors that we feel good about here is how valuable our switch capacity is, in this dynamic environment margins have shifted. And also how important it is our integration our long value chain. If you think North America today is capturing it in crush and maybe less so in biodiesel in Europe, we don't capture that much in crush, but we capture it in biodiesel. So, all this ability of our footprint to allow us to follow the margin, as it moves through the value chain has been very, very beneficial in these very volatile times. Adam, maybe on the first question that you mentioned, again, the $4 to $4.50, as I said before, just to clarify, is our baseline in which we ran the exercise, because that was the landing spot of our previous strategy. And it's not a forecast or guidance for this year. Good morning, Ben. Good morning, Luke. Yes. So the answer is, yes, to both. So we have a big permit for Decatur that we plan to of course leverage. And then, yes, we are exploring our ability to do so for other plants. We've been doing this relatively quietly, Luke since 2017. And as I said before, we have stored more than 3.5 million tons, safely underground. And this gives us the ability to start differentiating our products that we can assign some of the credits to some of these products and have those products be deemed low-carbon intensity product. So we have again, a big experience. We've been doing this for four years, in two different facilities. And we feel very good about the future. And this is going to be a growing part of our operations, for sure. That's correct. Yeah. Yeah. Let me tell you why -- what -- one better if you will, as per your question. I think that this was the quarter that we needed to restart the ethanol dry mills that we have taken down, due to lack of demand. And we have from a technical perspective the perfect start-up. And certainly, they hit the ground with better margins than maybe we anticipated before bringing them up. Second, as we explained before, we have very good risk management that the team positioned very well on corn and on the ethanol complex. And certainly sweeteners volumes came back versus last year, as customers were preparing for the summer. And to a certain degree you might have to take both Q2 and Q3 together from a sweetener perspective, because I think that a lot of customers bought in anticipation of refilling their pipeline given the summer and the openness with COVID that we will go into experience in the U.S. So it was a strong volume month as well. Hi, Ken. Good morning. Yes. Ken, I would say, if you look at our past what we have been doing over the last five years probably -- and if you think about translating everything we've done in productivity and innovation we were probably two-third in productivity and one-third in innovation if you will of all the savings we were getting. As we look at as I said before at our plan going forward, the contribution between productivity and innovation is equal. It's about 50-50. And it's mainly driven by all these opportunities that I mentioned not only nutrition, but all the other things that we're seeing whether it's biomaterials or renewable green diesel and all the other things that we've done. Again, when we look at our plan, when we start from this again theoretical $4 to $4.50 range and we apply all these projects that are included in productivity and innovation we see our program over the next five years growing in the high single-digit percentage every year in operating profit. So we feel very good about that. We will be having Ken in Q4 an Investor Day where we will be disclosing much more details and much more granularity about all these. But you can see some of the things that we're doing already whether we are invested in Spiritwood or the acquisition of Sojaprotein or the expansions of our plant in Valencia with Biopolis and microbiome. So all these areas are receiving organic growth dollars. This will be -- as we go forward Ken and you look at this plan this is more an investment plan than maybe the previous period was. So you will see a little bit more CapEx and a little bit more investment given the size of the opportunities. When I was mentioning some of the sizes of these addressable markets we have if you added some of the things I was saying these are markets north of $300 billion in which we have positioned ourselves very, very well and we think that we're going to capture a nice share of those. So the opportunity ahead of us is significant. Yes. Let me say, when I look at the three businesses and we move them forward through the five years we see Ag Services and Oilseeds growth moderately, but it grows. We see Carb Solutions being flat to slightly declining in our forecasting. And then we see a strong growth in Nutrition. That's kind of the -- if you will the algorithm of how the business has moved. The Ag Services and Oilseeds part -- part of that has been our own improvement, part of that has been the industry. There has been some consolidations and the industry margins are strong. And there has been a strong demand and we trust that there's going to continue to be a strong demand. There are 400 million people in the middle class in China that are consuming very much like US type of consumer. And that's driving health and wellness, that's driving improving diets. And then there is sustainability that is driving a lot of the things that we're doing, not only RGD, because remember that before RGD, we were already having a very tight oil market based on food, on food oil. So, I think part is our structural issues and part is our own improvements that we have done over these years. You're welcome. Yes. Michael, listen, when we look forward on Nutrition. Nutrition is going to grow somewhere in that range, between 15% and 20%. So, we said, 15% this year and half into the year we have moved into 20%. So, something in that range. The business is going very strong. We've been able to grow that revenue during this quarter and we've been able to maintain margins, which it has been a very good job of controlling gross margins and EBITDA margin on sales. Our enthusiasm is not only for the categories in which we are positioned, but also on the win rates and the customer engagement. Our customer engagement as of -- in 2021 have doubled our customer engagement last year. And as the economy is reopening and foodservice become more active, customers are more willing to launch new promotions and new products, something that they were not doing before. So, we see that acceleration, whether it's in beverages or in health and wellness or alternative proteins. So again, I think you should think conservatively 15% per year; more aggressively 20% per year. But in that range, we will be growing over the next few years. Good morning, Tom. Yes. I think that the strategy in specialty proteins is stay close to our customers and match up with capabilities and supply this market that is growing very fast. The market is growing north of 10% per year. So \u2013 and it's moving fast in terms of the products. The products are continued to be improved every quarter. So we have a strong position in North America, our heritage position in soy derivatives. Then we build our position in South America, which is very strong. I remind you that that was $0.25 billion investment so significant. Then we build pea protein capacity in North Dakota. And now we're expanding that capacity to Europe. We have a small capacity in Europe. Now with this, we have bought \u2013 we have acquired the largest producer in Europe, which again has a great footprint of \u2013 in the middle of the non-GMO soybean harvest area but also it has a very nice set of products and they sell to 65 different countries in many, many applications. So we continue to build the capabilities. This will not be the last one that you're going to hear in terms of announcements for specialty protein. Again, this is \u2013 these are early days but it's a fast-growing market in which we have a leadership position and we pretend to \u2013 we intend to expand. Yes. Listen, I think that we are maybe more optimistic about China medium-term than maybe with the news are giving right now. China has done an exceptional job of controlling COVID. And as such, they have recovered from that very successfully. So there is a lot of economic activity and hence demand. They have done a terrific job in coming back from the ASF pandemic. They have recovered. So they have the consumer and they have the animals to actually consume. Of course, they are very strategic in their purchases. And right now, it's not the time to be buying a lot of beans because beans are expensive and there is a crop in the US coming. And we think that that's where \u2013 when they're going to come. You also have to remember a couple of things, Tom. Over the last two or three weeks, we lost 15 million tons of production around the world due to weather issues. Whether it was the drought in Canada with \u2013 that impacted canola and wheat, whether it was Russia, whether it was the impact was on sand and in wheat and whether it was the corn crop in Brazil because of drought, all these products are competitive products in the Russian to soybean meal. So those products will not be available to compete with soybean meal which will give soybean meal a higher inclusion in the ration. And in our estimate given the small canola crop in Canada, we think that China will have to probably import 2 million tons of extra soybean -- soybeans to offset that canola gap that they have right now. So all in all we feel that we're still going to have strong exports -- export volumes in the Q4 of this year from North America. Yes. Rob, the way we thought about it when we put together the plan is and I think I expressed some of that before is of course we look at the things that we can see into the future. You can argue the magnitude but we give our forecast forward and we add inflation to that. And we say some of these things may come back to the middle if you will or reverse to the means or whatever you want to call it. So, let's put the negative side there. So, we consider some of that. And then we look at our productivity and innovation and we said, can we build a robust enough agenda in productivity and innovation that actually can offset some of those headwinds whether they are headwinds on ethanol or whether they are whatever your favorite crush margin into the future or whether it's inflation? And we look at that and the result of that exercise is that productivity and innovation earnings stream coming forward offset all that potential decline that we have estimated and offset it and giving us a result that high single-digit growth rate in profits over the next five years. So that's the way we think about it. So this is not a scenario in which everything goes perfect and margins are at peak level for five years. In our scenario margins normalize we have inflation and then we are able to offset a lot of that through growth and through productivity. That's what we are saying in terms of our new base. Yes. I would say, maybe when I was answering Ken I think when we look at the three businesses, Nutrition provides a lot of the growth in that scenario of course. You have to remember, when we started reporting Nutrition yearly they were reporting about $300-and-something million. This quarter they crossed the barrier of $200 million. So now -- so it's significant. And you will see that in crescendo of course over the next few years as we reach $1 billion and beyond. Carb Solutions as you said is -- it basically declines over the period. And then we have a healthy, but not exuberant growth rate for Ag Services and Oilseeds. So all in all, when you look at our numbers it doesn't look a far-fetched scenario. On the contrary it's a scenario that we're very confident that's why we are making it public today. And a lot of things under our control to be honest. Yeah. Listen I think that there has been consolidation in the small regional players, which has been important. We have the example of Algar in Brazil. We also did the soybean joint venture with Cargill in Egypt. So -- and there have been others around the industry. I think it's important to notice that we've been working in this expansion, the Spiritwood for the last two years. We just announced it now. But this is capacity that, of course, this one is helped by RGD. But when you think about soybean meal in North America, we need about two to three -- to offset -- 2% to 3% growth in demand every year. So we need a full-time full-fledged plant every couple of years just to keep up with demand and to be able to supply the growth. So we don't think that any of these build is excessive. On the contrary, we think that it's needed to allow demand to be fulfilled. Good morning Ben. Yeah. Listen that is a business that to a certain degree started from a customer pool. We discovered one day that a lot of the products that we were selling in Carb Solutions were finding their way into non-food applications, non-beverage application. So now we have started with a new team on a more proactive approach to that. So we have a market based approach where we're targeting things like construction and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and other products. And we've been very successful. This team has been growing \u2013 they have been growing sales about 10 \u2013 at the 10% click. These are very profitable opportunities and opportunities that at this point in time require no capital, because these are existing products going into new applications. So we have hired experts, marketing experts, and technical experts to be able to sell these into new applications. And we fill in an incredible customer pool. Every CEO or company out there that is announcing this de-carbonization goal's for 2040 or whatever needs to shift to plant-based materials from oil based in order to de-carbonize. And we are the largest company in that space with the ability to provide the broadest footprint of products. So you will continue to see growth there, and we are just getting started. That will be my comment. We cannot talk a lot about \u2013 as you can understand about our customer engagement, because these are confidential agreements that we have and a lot of these the customers don't want to disclose what they are doing. You're welcome. Yeah. Thank you, Ben. So let me address South America first. So, of course, our bigger participation is Brazil. It has been a tough year for Brazil this first half of the year in general. We expect second half of the year to have the possibility to be a little better. Biodiesel is B12 now and that has been confirmed. We'll have to see the first auctions there. So crush margins are better. Domestic margins are $25 to $30 per ton export is about $10. Bottle oil and volumes and prices are better in the last two months. We started the year tough there. Remember that, this is a society that is going through the tougher parts of COVID. So demand is difficult there. But we have seen an improvement. Domestic meal the market is also paying for the higher soybeans. So that's good. We have \u2013 Brazil has reduced exports of corn of course, because of the drought. But the domestic market is paying the premium. So Brazil is not going to run out of corn, and it's importing a little bit from Brazil. So I would say in general with oil \u2013 domestic oil being supported and the volumes being there and with biodiesel going back to B12, we expect the second half of the year to be a little bit better than maybe what the first half was. Yeah. You know that, we've been relatively quiet. We continue to be very selective about this because valuations are in general for some properties are a little bit too high. So it \u2013 this needs to be a perfect fit into our portfolio. And the perfect combination of things with Sojaprotein is in terms of the footprint, the complementarily of the geographic nature of it and the quality of management, and the assets and the products. In terms of what is easier to integrate, I think that sometimes bolt-ons are a little bit easier. We find they fit better in a business that is already structured. When you bring a large company you need more adjustments on both sides if you will, if you think about some of these companies that have continued to operate in ADM almost like with the same agility they were operating before, whether you say Protexin or Biopolis and some of these companies. So I think that the smaller companies are probably an easy tuck-in than maybe large companies. Large companies take us a little bit longer. You're welcome. Hi, Ben. Listen at this point in time, we are seeing good demand for both products. So, of course, as you know, there is a big pull from oil. There has been a big pull for oil. And then RGD is increasing a little bit of that, but our ability to place the mill given our footprint and our commercial operations is very strong. So that gives us a lot of confidence for North America for the second half. Listen let me be clear. The Oilseeds and Ag Services business will have a very strong year much better than last year and we expect a strong second half as well that will drive the company to earnings that we never had before certainly. And certainly, we'll be probably on the higher side or maybe outside the range of 4 to 4.50 that I mentioned before that was the previous landing spot of our strategy. That's what we're seeing at the moment. So the year started strong and we think that the second half will be very strong. Okay. Very good. Thank you Juan and best of luck in the back half. Good morning, Eric. I think that, of course, as you described, there are many issues going on and there is a little bit of a transition here. But the reality is that pork prices have come down, that will incentivate demand. But you also need to understand that, in the -- during the ASF, people get to eat more poultry as well. And we have seen that demand growth. We think that when we have a better supply and cheaper supply of soybeans, things will come back a little bit more to normal. When we check with our customers over there, fundamentally, nothing has changed. And if you look at the -- as I said the middle class in China and you look at the indicators of that, which is the consumption of the big four protein, they are all higher than prepandemic levels. So the consumer is there, the animals are there to be fed. And I think that the rest is just a matter of tactical approaches, whether we had the big run-up in hog prices in China, then the government intervened to try to control that. Now they are lower. They said more wheat. I think that's going to shift to include more soybean in the portfolio -- in the inclusion. So, we think that at the end of the day, there may be many monthly gyrations, but over time, protein consumption continues to go up and they will import more soybeans to actually satisfy that demand. So, we feel very confident about the future of the demand in China."

The Ag Services and Oilseeds team followed up on their exceptional first quarter with another outstanding quarter. Ag Services results were higher year-over-year. The North American origination business delivered an outstanding second quarter, managing its positions effectively in a dynamic pricing environment and also achieved significantly higher export volumes, driven by corn sales to China. South American origination was significantly lower than the previous year's quarter driven by slower farmer selling and high commodity prices, which impacted contract fulfillment. Global trade performance was lower than the second -- strong second quarter of 2020 when customers were building inventories in mid-COVID-19. Results were also impacted by timing impacts that should reverse. Crushing had substantially higher year-over-year results. The business executed well in an environment of strong vegetable oil demand to deliver higher execution margins in North America soy and EU softseeds. Results were partially offset by weaker soybean crush margins in South America, driven by lower demand for biodiesel. In addition there were about $70 million in net incremental negative timing effects which should reverse in the coming quarters. Refined products and other results were significantly higher than the prior year period, driven by continued recovery in foodservice as well as positive timing effects in North America, partially offset by the effects of the reduction in the Brazilian biodiesel mandates. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher year-over-year. Now, looking ahead, we expect Q3 performance for Ag Services and Oilseeds to be higher than the third quarter of 2020, driven by stronger results in crushing. We continue to anticipate full year results that will be significantly higher than 2020's very strong performance. Slide 10 please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team did a great job delivering results that were almost double those of the prior year period. Starches and Sweeteners, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered substantially higher year-over-year results in a highly dynamic pricing environment, driven by about $90 million in positioning gains across the ethanol complex, as well as more normalized results from corn oil. Sweetener volumes were higher reflecting the beginnings of a recovery in demand from the foodservice channel. Ethanol margins improved versus the prior year period driven by a resurgence in driving miles in the United States. Good morning. Hi Ben. Ben, are you on the line? Good morning, Luke. It's going to -- on your question on corn oil, we've seen convergence of corn oil with soybean oil again. Recall last year, we saw a divergence because of the snack foods people staying at home high demand for corn oil, which is used for frying that caused corn oil prices to move up dramatically and it diverged from soybean oil and that's what's caused a lot of the mark-to-market issues that we had last year. We've worked through all those issues over the course of the period. We're actually seeing right now corn oil and soybean oil really converging. And so we're turning back to, let's say, the normal relationship that we've seen in the past. Hi, Ken. Yes, Mike. Yes, there's been a lot of news regarding the recent Supreme Court ruling and some of the comments from the EPA. When you kind of cut through all the headlines, and try to understand like what's fundamentally happening, we still believe the Biden administration and the EPA is committed to fighting climate change and also decarbonizing the economy. And biofuels, frankly, is in a very important part of that agenda. So, the Biden administration has made it very clear that they don't intend to grant SREs or these small refinery exemptions like in the prior administrations. And as President Biden himself has said, he said that we should be insisting not exempting. So, we do expect the Biden EPA to take a very balanced approach towards granting future SREs. So, when you look at supply-demand balances going forward and you take a look at the RINs balances and you think about the recovery of driving miles as we move through the pandemic, our expectation is looking at supply/demand for ethanol -- for gasoline and then which translates to ethanol, we believe that it is going to result in a reasonably constructive ethanol environment for the industry over the medium-term. Now, at the same time, Mike it is important to note that in the case of our -- we've made a strategic decision to monetize our dry mills. And so, we kind of halted that process during the pandemic frankly, because ethanol demand was very weak. But during that period, we did look at alternatives. We took advantage to, frankly, explore other options. And there's -- frankly, as Juan talked about on the issue of sustainability, there's growing interest in sustainable materials and sustainable solutions. And it appears that there may be some opportunities for us to explore non-vehicle uses of ethanol and leveraging ethanol as a sustainable feedstock for other products. And so one of the promising areas is the Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF. With the airline industry moving towards effectively a low-carbon or a net-zero future, SAF appears to be an important component of how they will get there. And just for perspective, the US airline industry before the pandemic consumed 30 billion gallons of aviation fuel a year. So we are looking at the possibility of leveraging our Decatur carbon sequestration site, which Juan talked about, with our corn processing output as a feedstock for SAF to get towards a low-carbon SAF product. So in addition to looking at potential monetization of dry mills, we are looking at the SAF concept, which frankly may give us another option for finding another use of the dry mills and then taking those ethanol gallons off the vehicle market. Morning Ben. Yeah, Ben. I mean our team's do an excellent job managing risk, right? And when you just talk about managing risk is both managing the risks of the inputs and the outputs. And so the positioning gains that we had in the quarter, in the second quarter, the $90 million it's a combination of what I call the ethanol complex, right? So it's a combination of how they're managing the corn, how they're managing ethanol, how they're managing RINs, all these positions. And as you know it was a very volatile quarter when you looked at the prices of corn and ethanol and RINs but they managed exceptionally well. And so $90 million normally they would generate risk management gains. We highlighted it this quarter because this was an exceptional quarter. And by the way it wasn't just an exceptional quarter. It was an exceptional first half of the year, because when you take a look at the first half of the year, they probably had positioning gains roughly with a similar amount in the first quarter as well. So, therefore, the Carb Solutions team really hit all of the ballpark in terms of risk management in the first half of this year. Yeah. I mean, again I mean I would never ask the Carb Solutions team to hold back. But again they will always manage their positions exceedingly well. And I would say this was probably an exceptional performance for the first half of the year. Thank you Ben. Thank you, Eric."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the ADM First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Victoria de la Huerga, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. De la Huerga, you may begin.\nVictoria de la Huerga: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's first quarter earnings webcast. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's webcast will be available at adm.com.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Victoria. This morning, I am pleased to share with you results that demonstrate an outstanding start to 2021, building on our momentum from a record 2020. We reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, more than double the year ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, 86% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted OP growth. Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9%, 375 basis points higher than our 2021 annual WACC and significantly higher than the 7.6% in the year ago period. And our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.2 billion, 19% higher than the prior year period. I am proud of our team, and they continue to deliver sustained strong growth, powered by their continued advancement of the strategic transformation of our business, outstanding execution and excellent risk management and commitment to serving the evolving needs of our customers in new and innovative ways. I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of the trends, developments and accomplishments from the first quarter. Turn to slide four, please. First, we are encouraged by many of the demand indicators we are seeing. From a geographic perspective, China was one of the first countries to emerge from COVID-related restrictions, and we are continuing to see significant export demand driven by its economic recovery.\nRay Young: Yes. Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide eight, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. Ag Services results were substantially higher year-over-year. Results were driven by a record Q1 for our North American origination team, which executed extremely well to capitalize on strong Chinese demand. As expected, results in South America were significantly lower versus the prior year period. Farmer selling was lower versus the extremely aggressive pace in the year ago quarter. Lower margins, including the impacts from the slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs also affected South American results. Results for the quarter were affected by about $75 million in negative timing related to ocean freight position. Those impacts will reverse as contracts execute in the coming quarters. Crushing delivered its best quarter ever, as the business leverage its global footprint and diversified capabilities to capture strong execution margins in both soybean and softseed crushing, driven by robust vegetable oil demand and tight soybean stocks. Net timing impacts for the quarter in crush were minimal.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ray. Slide 12, please. I'm proud of the team for our great start to 2021. And I'm even more proud of the strategic work we have done to transform our company and enable our growing success. We began in 2011 by committing to specific strategic goals and financial metrics focused on what we call the three Cs, capital discipline, cost reduction and cash generation. We launched new initiatives like our $1 billion challenge with prioritized operational excellence, and we focused on returns our primary financial metric. We call that getting fit for the journey. Once we were fit, we launched the next part of our strategy, focusing on three core pillars to enhance returns, deliver more predictable growth and strengthen our ability to control our results. During this time, our team has done a great job, optimizing business performance, realigning our portfolio and building a global leader in nutrition, driving efficiencies through our operational excellence initiatives and expanding through organic growth investments, M&A and the broadening of our customer base and product offerings. Now we're moving into the next phase of our strategic transformation by sharpening our focus on two strategic pillars, productivity and innovation. Our productivity efforts will take many actions that were part of our optimized and drive focuses and boost them to the next level. The productivity pillar will include; advancing the roles of our Centers of Excellence or COEs in procurement, supply chain and operations to deliver additional efficiencies across the enterprise, the continued rollout of our One ADM business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes, and increasing our use of technology, analytics and automation at our production facilities in our offices and with our customers. Our innovation activities will help us accelerate growth and profitability, not just for the near term, but importantly, for the long-term. We will expand and invest in improving the customer experience, including leveraging our producer relationships and enhancing our use of state-of-the-art digital technology to help our customers grow. Sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of our products, solutions, capabilities and commitments to serve our customers' needs, and growth initiatives, including organic growth to support additional capacity and meet growing demand, opportunistic M&A and increased leveraging of our very successful venture capital portfolio. We'll support both pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding our digital capabilities and investing further in product research and development. And of course, all of our efforts will continue to be strengthened by our ongoing commitment to revenues. As I look at our long-term plans and this evolution of our strategy, I'm very excited about the value creation opportunities ahead of us. Our teams are continuing to perform at the high level and doing a great job serving our customers. The demand outlook for our products is strong, driven by the pre and during global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. And we are delivering on our potential and our promise. That is why we are even more optimistic in our 2021 outlook today than we were three months ago, with expectations for significantly higher full year operating profit and EPS versus our record 2020. And as we look beyond 2021, we expect that our sharpened focus on productivity and innovation, combined with continuing demand expansion driven by the fundamental needs and evolving demands of our global customers and the multi-year COVID recovery will deliver sustained growth in earnings in the years to come. With that, Chris, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  The first question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.\nKen Zaslow: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Zaslow: Just want to touch base. You kind of - your comment was - which was actually really interesting, that you expect growth, sustainable growth for years to come. So with that, just a couple of points. One is, do you look at 2021 or 2020 as the base year from which you can grow? And then second, what are the key demand drivers that you see beyond 2021 that will continue to propel you? Or is it more internal actions that would create the growth?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Ken. Listen, as I was referring in my remarks, we see the future with a lot of optimism. I mean, we think that fundamentally, we have, as you know, a strong agenda of both now productivity and innovation where there are things that we can control, that we drive under our control. And we've been executing a similar plan. So now you're going to see it strengthen. And it has a more longer horizon reach, if you will, that's where we like about this sharpening. But all this is in the - as supported by these three strong trends that we see in food security, health and well-being and sustainability. So let me give you a little bit of flavor there. We continue to see strong demand. You see food security, of course, as the global population grows. Protein demand continues to grow around the world as people increase their standards of living. And as countries come back from the pandemic on this demand that was, to a certain degree suppressed, we see that in China, we see that in the US. And we believe that given the uneven vaccine recovery of vaccine rollout, this will take several years. So that's in an environment, Ken, as you know, a very tight supply, demand balances. So we expect an environment of good profits for the following years. Then when we look at health and well-being, that's propelling our Nutrition division and many of our other offerings in which we continue to see strong growth even exacerbated, if you will with pandemics or other events. And we continue to see more demand for products made based on plans that what we call biosolutions or products that actually replace industrial products made from resources that are not renewable. We have a long list of interested parties in doing more of that and we continue to develop solutions for that. So again, when we see the trends, when we see the strong demand environment in a tight supply, demand environment, plus the agenda of productivity and innovation, we feel very strong about our ability to deliver earnings growth from where we are today.\nKen Zaslow: So in 2020 or 2021, would you say, is your year from which we could start thinking about growth?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I think that we - 2021, we're going to grow significantly versus 2020. So in 2021, we are establishing this sharpening again. So if you will, maybe we can reset to that level to 2021 and we start it from here. We have a rolling five year plan, as you know, Ken that we constantly update. And we constantly make it more robust, so we can deliver earnings growth year-over-year.\nKen Zaslow: Great. I appreciate. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. \nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi. So, I guess, my first question, really just trying to think about the market environment a little bit, and obviously, a lot of crop currents happening at the moment. Specifically, I want to think about on the oilseed franchise and the expansion of renewable diesel. And as we think about, one, you can sort of see it already in the soybean oil market and what that's doing to crush margins. But as we think about the second half of the year into next year as some of the bigger capacities start to come on, how do we think about the earnings leverage, both in your crushing franchise, but also in the edible oils business with the refining that we - a business that never really got that much attention and grown much for a number of years given the move away from Transfast , but would seem to be kind of very strategic for a bunch of refiners who don't have pre-treatment over the next couple of years? And then I got a capital allocation question afterwards.\nJuan Luciano: Adam, listen, we said it before, we feel very strongly about the future of our Oilseeds business. It's a business that was built traditionally in one leg, if you will, from the mill supporting all these, and we were always waiting for the oil story. The oil story, I mean, you can see that right now playing up, oil values that reach record levels, softseed margins that been the best in the last eight years, if you will. So they are supporting very good soy crush margins and great softseed margins. We invested in this many years ago, remember, with all the switch capacity, we have about give or take, 15% of our total crush capacity that can be switched from soybeans to softseed. So that's an advantage for us. And now all of a sudden, we are having this new demand that is coming because of all the sustainability trends that we discussed before with this in the form of renewable green diesel. So it just comes to strengthen our belief into this business that is very strategic for us. And to be honest, very proud of the way the business is executing. These are not easy markets to navigate with a lot of volatility, with very big values, and they are having touch wood and impeccable run. And they've done very well, given their sophistication and knowledge of - and to be honest, also the visibility that being a full value chain supplier and a global supplier gives us. So continue to work very close with our food and fuel customers and staying close to them to make sure we can read what's coming down the pipe. But again, Adam, very, very encouraged by all these developments and very happy for our strategic Oilseed business.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That's really helpful, Juan. And my second question is really on the balance sheet. Maybe this is more for Ray. And I'm just trying to think about kind of cash capital deployment from here. Obviously, you have to be very sensitive to the increase in commodity prices and the impact that has on readily marketable inventories. But I mean impressively, your credit capacity has actually gone up on a year-on-year basis, despite the rising in RMI. And so I'm just trying to think about what would it take to see cash return to shareholders or more aggressive or offensive M&A moving forward? It seems like there's a lot of underlying cash generation in the business, and it doesn't seem like we've got a clear kind of target of where it's going at the moment.\nRay Young: Well, first of all, the balance sheet is what I consider one of the greatest assets of ADM. And while inventories have actually increased 50% compared to March of last year, we still have significant available credit capacity to undertake actions, right? And so I think the first priority is continue to fund the working capital needs. It's not a surprise. Commodity prices continue to go up right now. And so therefore, we will use our balance sheet to kind of fund additional working capital requirements. And - but secondly, we have flexibility to do whatever we need to do from a strategic perspective. As you know, in prior periods, during higher commodity prices, there are distressed assets in the marketplace. And so to the extent that there are distressed assets that make sense for us to acquire in order to consolidate, we'll look at those. That's one of the big advantages of our ADM balance sheet. So - but we all know that eventually commodity prices will come down, and that will free up additional capital on the balance sheet. And then we can look at additional incremental returns on capital to our shareholders at that point in time. But again, the dividend, we've increased the dividend. That's an important element of return on capital to our shareholders. But I'm convinced that our balance sheet because we all know prices go through cycles, there will be a release of working capital at some juncture that will again free up significant capacity for us to take additional return of capital actions.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That\u2019s a really helpful color. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Simonitsch of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTom Simonitsch: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Tom.\nRay Young: Hey, Tom.\nTom Simonitsch: Could you give us some more color around your - how you're managing your crush assets this year compared to any other? To what extent are you locking in crush capacity for the next few quarters? And on the oil side, how are you approaching negotiations with potential renewable diesel customers versus your more traditional food customers?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. So I can say we have a reasonable visibility on the Q2 for Oilseeds as we have a book build. And we stay a little bit more open for the Q3 and Q4. That's probably to the extent that I will disclose. In terms of food versus oil customers, listen, we're staying close to both. Of course, we provide - we have long-term relationships with our food customers that - we've been working with them through all these and educating them on this new demand that is coming. And we are forging new relationships with customers from renewable diesel that of course, the big issue for that industry is feedstock availability. So we're having a lot of discussions that range from the tactical to the strategic discussions with some of them as they decide on their future investments. So that's what I will describe the relationship.\nTom Simonitsch: Thank you. And then just a question on Nutrition, I think you mentioned a shift in demand for texturants. Can you provide some more color there?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. We've seen some softness in some of those segments. But I would say this is a little bit of a transition time in - Nutrition goes to so many applications, and depending on the geography, foodservices in some parts are coming back and in some other parts, that's still delayed. So, I would say, in general, I'm very pleased actually. Nutrition surpassed my own expectations this quarter by growing profitability by around 9% and revenue 5%. It was - the demand recovery from COVID and the impact of that in different markets is very uneven around the world, as the world is getting access to vaccination at different rates. So we are seeing that. So, as I said, this was a quarter of, remember, investment in Nutrition. So we were expecting results similar to last year. We end up delivering results that are 9% better than last year, so very happy with this. We had some specific pockets of softness, maybe some chewing gum kind of softness, some softness in some places in Animal Nutrition. But overall, very strong flavors, beverages, supplements, fibers, probiotics, specialty proteins. So, the main trends remain there.\nTom Simonitsch: Thank you for that. And maybe just one more question for me. If you wouldn't mind, could you share your house view of US planted acres of corn versus beans?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I would say, in our view, given the early planting the start that we have in the US, I think we have corn about 17%, on soybeans and about 8% at the moment. We believe that there is probably upside to the USDA numbers. So we believe that by the next time USDA will report acres, we're probably going to find maybe five more million acres, combined between soy and corn, kind of evenly split, if you will, give or take between the two.\nTom Simonitsch: Excellent. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Tom.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Luke Washer of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLuke Washer: Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nJuan Luciano: Hi, Luke.\nRay Young: Hey, Luke.\nLuke Washer: So I wanted to touch on, soybean oil a little bit. I know you've talked a little bit about renewable diesel trend. But have you seen soybean oil demand ramp this quarter relative to your expectations perhaps at the beginning of this quarter? And is this largely driven by renewable diesel demand? Or are you also seeing increased demand for edible oils? And is there any distraction is happening with the prices where they are?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Listen, we continue to see strong demand. I think that as some restaurants and in some places are reopening, we started to see food services coming back a little bit. To be honest, we saw that across the company, not only in soybean oil, I would say March orders were significantly better than January and February. And I think we see that continuing in April. So again, a - recovery, but we can see that. I would say, of course, green diesel customers are starting to show in demand. So we see that increase demand. So in general, we see a strong demand. In terms of disruption of demand, we haven't seen that to any degree. Probably the only example I can pinpoint is Brazil with biodiesel that reduced from B13 to B10. That's probably the only thing you can say. Things have become expensive, at least. And Brazil, as I may -- as I've mentioned, in my onset remarks, Brazil is having a very difficult time with COVID. So I think that the overall economy is suffering. And I think the government is trying to alleviate some - to alleviate a little bit the pressure on inflation there. So - but that's probably the only example I can pinpoint to at this point of demand disruption.\nLuke Washer: Great. Thanks, Juan. And then maybe one more on Nutrition, can you talk about what's driving your confidence in the 15% CAGR that you expect this year? What are the ways that you're driving operating profit margins higher? Is this simply growing in higher-margin businesses? Or are you doing cross-selling or any other actions you're taking? Maybe just some of the puts and takes for this year.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, absolutely. Listen, remember the 15% came from - we put together the five year plan. And when we see us achieving our target of $1 billion OP, basically by 2024, give or take, in order to get there, we need to grow 15%. So we were planning to start this year. And this year, it's not an exception to that. We plan 15%. When we started the year, we were planning to start the year, as I said, kind of flattish versus - and the business continue to show strength. How that strength comes part is revenue growth. Part of my confidence is given  by the pipeline. We have a strong pipeline. We are very - the team is very disciplined and religious in looking at the pipeline and looking at customer-by-customer and the projects. And that pipeline continues to grow, and our win rate continues to grow. So those are very positive indicators that your value proposition is very appreciated by our customers. Certainly, another thing that we do is that the team manage the product mix very well. And that allows us to increase profitability even in excess of the revenue growth that we see. And you know, there are different parts, while, for example, for flavors and for plant based proteins and certainly for probiotics is much more a revenue growth story. For parts like Animal Nutrition, it's more like a margin recovery story. And so we have different ways to manage this portfolio that we call nutrition, but it's a very complex portfolio. But that complexity also brings a lot of growth opportunities. And that's why it give us a confidence that it's a very balanced business from an opportunity perspective, supported by a very strong pipeline.\nLuke Washer: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you and congratulations. I have a question about the crush margins in the quarter. I mean, such an outstanding result. And I think you've mentioned that risk management or just execution played a role. If you look at spot margins during the quarter, just looking at board prices, they weren't nearly this good. But I've heard that you and others have been delivering results much better than that. So I guess, my question is, can you explain why it's so different from what we see in the spot markets? And is this sustainable into 2Q? Or are there some unusual aspects of first quarter that we should know about?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. No, listen, it was a very clean quarter. There's nothing that you should know about other than cash crush margins remain very healthy. We have a strong product demand from both meal and specialty oil. And these margins remain considerably stronger than what board crush indicates, particularly in North America and Europe. If you look at board crush in North America or Europe per month is about $25 per ton, and then we see margins on a cash basis of around $40 per ton. So there is a significant difference there. I would say, we see - as I said before, we have reasonable visibility into Q2 given the book of business we have. So we shouldn't see any surprises there, and we are expecting another good quarter of crush over there. So I mentioned before, we have our switch capacity. Softseed margins have been good. They moderated a little bit since Q1, but they continue to be very good. So oil values continue to be strong. And demand for our customers in mill in North America, our customers are enjoying good margins at this point in time. So they are trying to produce as much as they can. So we see strong demand from both lakes of the crush. So we feel good about it at the moment.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Your line is open. \nBen Bienvenu: Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to focus on \u2013 with two questions on the Carbohydrate Solutions business, which was really, really solid in the quarter, and focusing first on those Starches and Sweeteners business. To the extent you can, can you disaggregate the contribution from your ethanol production out of your wet mills versus the kind of core Starches and Sweeteners business. And on that Starches and Sweeteners business, were net corn cost a tailwind for you guys? I know you favorably hedged your gross corn costs in 4Q. So I'm wondering kind of what the relationship between that hedged corn versus the strong co-product values delivered as it relates to your realized net corn costs?\nRay Young: Yes, Ben. So let me improve  reverse order. So net corn cost was a tailwind for us. I mean, clearly, as we pointed out in the last earnings call, we actually procured a lot of our requirements at a very attractive price last year. And hence, we benefit from basically a very good procurement. And hence, net corn was a tailwind for us, despite the fact that when you look at the board, corn costs are higher right now. With respect to the question on disaggregating Starches and Sweeteners from ethanol, my only comment is one of the big improvements in Starches and Sweeteners in the quarter compared to last quarter, last year's first quarter was the fact that we didn't have the corn oil mark-to-market impact. If you recall last year, we had about a $50 million negative impact due to the corn oil divergence from soybean oil. We didn't have it this year. So that was clearly a tailwind in terms of our results. From a volume perspective, when you look at the Starches and Sweetener business right now, we're still - we're certainly looking, I'm looking at corn - high fructose corn syrup. And corn syrup, we're still down versus last year. So we are suffering from the impact of the pandemic and because the foodservice sector is not fully recovered, we indicated that we're starting to see elements of recovery in the month of March. But from a volume perspective, in the first quarter, total Sweetener volumes are still down versus last year, right? So therefore, that's kind of like a headwind. But we expect that to progressively recover as we move through the year. So I guess, overall, I mean, we've been actually pretty pleased in terms of the performance. Given this particular headwind we had in the first quarter, we were very pleased in terms of how we manage the business, favorable net corn procurement, favorable risk management. And frankly, even with the cold weather impacts that we had in the first quarter, we were able to keep on delivering to our customers, which is very, very important.\nBen Bienvenu: Very good. Okay. Great. My second question is on DCP  and your decision to restart your dry mills. We're seeing improving driving demand, gasoline demand off of kind of low this year and last year. I'm curious, though, we've seen production in the weekly EIA numbers come out that have been a little bit lagging, I think, what might be expected when thinking about your facilities coming back online. Can you help us think about your outlook for as much visibility as you have as it relates to ethanol S&D  And when you think about the velocity of restarting your mills, what is your focus there? Are you worried about that disrupting the S&D and ethanol? To the extent you can give us any color on?\nJuan Luciano:  And they have grown in the first three months of the year. They import proteins, that\u2019s up like 20% and they continue to have very strong forecast for the importation of grains to feed animals. So that's what we're seeing. Of course, corn prices have been expensive in China. And so, China has been taking as much as wheat as they can from Europe to try to make a little bit of substitution. But they also don't have infinite wheat reserves. And during this year, we think that both coal reserves and wheat reserve needs to be replenished at one point in time. We don't think that that's happening now. Nobody is replenishing inventories in the face of an inverse. But we think that, that may happen later in the year.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. And one, if I could just ask you a follow-up about your comments on sort of bio-based products that you made during your prepared remarks, were you just referring to sort of the initiative \u2013 the existing initiatives around FDME and cardboard and fiber and acrylic acid? Or are there new things that you're looking at? Or going back to some of the old stuff like PHA? Or just - what did you want to tell us about that, anything incremental?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I think that there is a portfolio of things. Some of the ones you mentioned, we are not going back to PHA. But there are some more in areas like, construction or pharma or personal care. We continue to find customers that have application development capabilities, but they want to change their input. And instead of being natural gas on oil, they want it plant-based. And for that, listen, we have - we stand on a great source of sugar that is the car solution business. We have fermentation technologies. And we have a good cost position here in the US, and as we have the capability, the critical mass. So I think that we are an attractive partner that everybody that is brainstorming or looking for a solution to match their sustainability targets is having discussions with our team. So there are some things that we cannot unveil right now, but we may unveil it over the course of the year.\nBen Bienvenu: Thanks very much.\nJuan Luciano: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Piken: Yes. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit about South America. Maybe we could start with Brazil and just you know, things like there is been some weather issues with the safrinha crop. And just trying to understand, how you see kind of your volumes and business shaping out in South America over the next couple of quarters? And if net-net, at this point, do we - are we cheering for a bigger South American crop or a smaller South American crop with respect to your overall global footprint?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Michael. Yes. South America, the weather in South America, of course, delayed a little bit the growth. And certainly, it's hurting a little bit the safrinha. We still expect - traditionally, April and May are dry weather months in Brazil. So that's not great for this. And that's what putting a little bit of the premium in - the weather premium on corn. So we expect that crop to be a little bit smaller. And Brazil exports about 35% of their corn production. So that is an impact in the market. What are we rooting for? We are rooting for larger crops. We like to move crops. So the soy crop is expected to be a good one, maybe 135 million, 136 million tons, so that's in check. And I think what Brazil is doing at the moment is maybe getting a little bit of corn from Argentina. Certainly, it's getting wheat to try to replace some of the corn in feeding. Because adjusted, as I said before, the B13 bio-diesel to B10. So it's a year in which Brazil needs to navigate with - on very tight stocks. And so it's going to be a difficult year and a year of heavy management for the Brazilian, the crush and the grain side of this.\nMichael Piken: Great. And then as a follow-up, just thinking ahead to 2022, with the projected growth in renewable biodiesel combined with a very - or a tightening corn market. I mean, how do you sort of see the acreage playing out in the US for 2022 between corn and soybeans to meet this demand? And I guess from your perspective, I know you guys have some swing capacity, but just, it seems like there's other crushing capacity up in Canada. Softseed, three of their competitors have announced expansions. How do you see kind of the margin environment working out if we need to plant more corn next year? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I think that, of course, the farmer react to pricing. And although - this may be too late to shift a lot of acres to corn, given how late we are already. I think, first of all, they will try to plant as much as possible next year as well, given prices will continue to be elevated. I think, listen, as it gets tied the market, that's an advantage of our value chain. Our procurement, our long value chain, the fact that we have such a good coverage of everywhere, in a tight market, that's where our footprint shines and we get the competitive advantage, if you will. So we like to have more crops. But in periods in which crops are going to be tied, we have a good system to make sure we get our hands into the crops. And because of sometimes basis go up. But to be honest, given the strong demand and the good profitability of our customers, I think we will be able to price those in. So I think that we are looking constructively about in terms of margins for the future.\nMichael Piken: And your thoughts on the acreage shift?\nJuan Luciano: It's too early to tell. And there are too many factors. I mean, we are still trying to plant, we haven't planted like 10% of our crop, it's difficult to speculate about the 2022 crop here.\nMichael Piken: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Your line is open.\nBen Theurer: Hi. Good morning, Juan, Ray and thanks for taking my question.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Theurer: Congrats on the results.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you.\nBen Theurer: Two quick ones. So first of all, you gave a little bit of guidance into the different segments, but could you elaborate first on the Ag Service piece within ASO, how you think about that turning into 2Q and particularly in light what we're seeing in your appendix on the cumulative crush deferred timing gains? Because I remember last call, you said the vast majority of the close to $300 million to likely reverse within the first half. And we haven't seen much in 1Q. So how do we think - shall we think about those timing gains? And how shall we think about the underlying business within Ag Service in particular over the second quarter?\nRay Young: Yes. For Ag Services, seasonally, Q2 will be lower than Q1, right? I mean that's what happens. I mean North America, we had a very strong Q1 in terms of North American exports. Again, partly as Juan indicated, a delayed South American harvest. It allowed the export window in North America to really benefit. And then we just had significant demand pull, which resulted in very strong elevation margins in the first quarter. So second quarter for Ag Services, it will revert back to more of a normal level here. The demand environment is still good, but it's not going to be as stellar as what we saw in the first quarter. On your question on timing differences, remember, this is a question, right? I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's about $75 million related to global trade and ocean freight that will reverse over the course of the year. In the appendix, the timing effects referred to in the appendix are related to crush. And just a reminder, in the first quarter, we didn't see much of a reversal in the first quarter, despite the fact that we had at the end of 2020, about $295 million in timing effects. And the reason being is that while we're seeing some reversals occurring, we're also building up new timing effects, because as you know, cash crush remains extremely strong. So some of the new contracts we're putting on, we're actually creating new timing effects. And so I just want to just kind of caution people that in this type of environment, even though there's about like $265 million of timing effects yet to unwind because of new timing effects that will likely occur over the course of the year, we may not see the full unwind occur this year. So that's just my only caution I want to provide listeners to the call on these timing effects. Thank you.\nBen Theurer: Okay. And then just, Ray, not pushing much here, but how do you think about the actual on a year-over-year basis, not on a sequential basis just compared to second quarter of last year because there was obviously a lot of things going on and some structure and some of the plans, just try to understand how we should put the second quarter of \u201821 into context with the second quarter of \u201820?\nRay Young: Yes. So in my prepared remarks, I did say that we're likely going to have lower Ag Services results this year, second quarter compared to last year, right. So - don't forget, remember, last year, we were benefiting a lot from South America, a farmer selling, right, and that was extremely strong last year first quarter, but particularly second quarter. So we're not going to see that impact this year, so that's going to be the primary driver as to why Ag Services. This year Q2 will be lower than last year's Q2.\nBen Theurer: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. I'll leave it here. Thanks. Congrats again.\nRay Young: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Larson of Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.\nEric Larson: Yes. Thank you and congratulations, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Hi, Eric.\nRay Young: Hi, Eric.\nEric Larson: I'll make it really quick I have a couple questions that - one's a real near term question of kind of exports over the next couple quarters, the USDA is way behind I think in what they're going - what they're giving China credit for corn exports through the year, something like 6 million or 7 million metric tons, and yet we're seeing the cash markets, futures are strong, but the cash markets are nothing short of astonishing. So are we trying to fill some of those on-price, maybe, China contracts from US farmers, are they just holding back. I guess how tight really is the US corn market? We know the oil markets are really tight. Canada's importing rapeseed from the Ukraine, so we know that the North American oilseed markets are tight, but how tight is the US corn market right now given cash prices?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Eric listen, we think as I said before that the US continues to be competitive in the second quarter for corn exports, so we're going to see some of those exports. As Ray was saying before, Ag Services probably innovation margin will not be the same because we won't have the same program of soybean on top of that. China continues to be buying everything they can, they are buying corn, but they are buying wheat as I said before, from several places and we have certain weather sports in the world. Canada and France are too cold and too dry, that has put some pressure on wheat with all this demand. Australia's infrastructure is trying to recover from a cyclone, so the exploitability of wheat there is also a little bit limited for loading that has created some pressure. So, for the moment corn continues to be competitive, the US exporting corn, but pretty soon it will become landed in China a little bit more expensive than wheat and then - but then we're getting tighter because of the bad weather. So we are looking at all those dynamics. So it's very difficult to answer this tough question specifically, but that's what I will think that all day is looking at all those dynamics and making sure we alter our product flows to fit the best origin.\nEric Larson: Okay, yes. Okay, thank you. Yes, well, Chad is playing every bushel of barley and sorghum and I think they're around the world everywhere, but. So the final question is a longer term question that I'm really - somewhat concerned about, we've seen the Biden administration now talk about a 30% Conservation Plan, meaning they want to put 30% of USA, of all US land, all 30% of all water into conservation programs. At the same time increase the CRP program. Does that mean that we're in a land grab, I know we're in early stages, just as I said  buy land, do we encourage people to put it aside. Does it take more farmland out of production now at a time when we really actually need the production. How do you - what are initial reads of the Biden's recently announced conservation plans?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Listen, I think the administration has shown from the beginning that of course, fighting climate change was going to be one of their priorities, which we support. And we have a strong sustainability program. I think that we need to start working on - and it's important to work very closely with the farmers to try to listen to - the farmer understands the responsibility. We have at the moment maybe 25% of acres doing precision agriculture, which I think will increase yield without needing more land. And I think that there will be a discussion with the administration and it will be a pressure between environmental long-term goals and short term feeding needs of the world. The world needs the US capacity as they need the Brazilian capacity, so these prices show that we need those acres. So I think that this cannot be automatic, is something that we will have to work out balancing all the stakeholders, people that need the food or with the long term needs for conserving the planet.\nEric Larson: All right. Thank you, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: And that was our final question for today. I will now return the call to Ms. de la Huerga for final remarks.\nVictoria de la Huerga: Thank you, Chris. Slide 13 notes upcoming investor events in which we will be participating. Before we close, I wanted to note that, I will be transitioning to a new position as President of our Sweet Foods and Dairy products group in ADM Human Nutrition business. I will be transitioning my investor relations role to Vikram Luthar, who will also continue to be the CFO for our Nutrition Business. I'd like to thank our analysts and shareholders for all their insight and support over the past three years. And as always, please feel free to follow-up with me, if you have any questions. Have a good day. And thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Victoria. This morning, I am pleased to share with you results that demonstrate an outstanding start to 2021, building on our momentum from a record 2020. We reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, more than double the year ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, 86% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted OP growth. Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9%, 375 basis points higher than our 2021 annual WACC and significantly higher than the 7.6% in the year ago period. And our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.2 billion, 19% higher than the prior year period. I am proud of our team, and they continue to deliver sustained strong growth, powered by their continued advancement of the strategic transformation of our business, outstanding execution and excellent risk management and commitment to serving the evolving needs of our customers in new and innovative ways. I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of the trends, developments and accomplishments from the first quarter. Turn to slide four, please. First, we are encouraged by many of the demand indicators we are seeing. From a geographic perspective, China was one of the first countries to emerge from COVID-related restrictions, and we are continuing to see significant export demand driven by its economic recovery. Thank you, Ray. Slide 12, please. I'm proud of the team for our great start to 2021. And I'm even more proud of the strategic work we have done to transform our company and enable our growing success. We began in 2011 by committing to specific strategic goals and financial metrics focused on what we call the three Cs, capital discipline, cost reduction and cash generation. We launched new initiatives like our $1 billion challenge with prioritized operational excellence, and we focused on returns our primary financial metric. We call that getting fit for the journey. Once we were fit, we launched the next part of our strategy, focusing on three core pillars to enhance returns, deliver more predictable growth and strengthen our ability to control our results. During this time, our team has done a great job, optimizing business performance, realigning our portfolio and building a global leader in nutrition, driving efficiencies through our operational excellence initiatives and expanding through organic growth investments, M&A and the broadening of our customer base and product offerings. Now we're moving into the next phase of our strategic transformation by sharpening our focus on two strategic pillars, productivity and innovation. Our productivity efforts will take many actions that were part of our optimized and drive focuses and boost them to the next level. The productivity pillar will include; advancing the roles of our Centers of Excellence or COEs in procurement, supply chain and operations to deliver additional efficiencies across the enterprise, the continued rollout of our One ADM business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes, and increasing our use of technology, analytics and automation at our production facilities in our offices and with our customers. Our innovation activities will help us accelerate growth and profitability, not just for the near term, but importantly, for the long-term. We will expand and invest in improving the customer experience, including leveraging our producer relationships and enhancing our use of state-of-the-art digital technology to help our customers grow. Sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of our products, solutions, capabilities and commitments to serve our customers' needs, and growth initiatives, including organic growth to support additional capacity and meet growing demand, opportunistic M&A and increased leveraging of our very successful venture capital portfolio. We'll support both pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding our digital capabilities and investing further in product research and development. And of course, all of our efforts will continue to be strengthened by our ongoing commitment to revenues. As I look at our long-term plans and this evolution of our strategy, I'm very excited about the value creation opportunities ahead of us. Our teams are continuing to perform at the high level and doing a great job serving our customers. The demand outlook for our products is strong, driven by the pre and during global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. And we are delivering on our potential and our promise. That is why we are even more optimistic in our 2021 outlook today than we were three months ago, with expectations for significantly higher full year operating profit and EPS versus our record 2020. And as we look beyond 2021, we expect that our sharpened focus on productivity and innovation, combined with continuing demand expansion driven by the fundamental needs and evolving demands of our global customers and the multi-year COVID recovery will deliver sustained growth in earnings in the years to come. With that, Chris, please open the line for questions. Good morning, Ken. Yes. Thank you, Ken. Listen, as I was referring in my remarks, we see the future with a lot of optimism. I mean, we think that fundamentally, we have, as you know, a strong agenda of both now productivity and innovation where there are things that we can control, that we drive under our control. And we've been executing a similar plan. So now you're going to see it strengthen. And it has a more longer horizon reach, if you will, that's where we like about this sharpening. But all this is in the - as supported by these three strong trends that we see in food security, health and well-being and sustainability. So let me give you a little bit of flavor there. We continue to see strong demand. You see food security, of course, as the global population grows. Protein demand continues to grow around the world as people increase their standards of living. And as countries come back from the pandemic on this demand that was, to a certain degree suppressed, we see that in China, we see that in the US. And we believe that given the uneven vaccine recovery of vaccine rollout, this will take several years. So that's in an environment, Ken, as you know, a very tight supply, demand balances. So we expect an environment of good profits for the following years. Then when we look at health and well-being, that's propelling our Nutrition division and many of our other offerings in which we continue to see strong growth even exacerbated, if you will with pandemics or other events. And we continue to see more demand for products made based on plans that what we call biosolutions or products that actually replace industrial products made from resources that are not renewable. We have a long list of interested parties in doing more of that and we continue to develop solutions for that. So again, when we see the trends, when we see the strong demand environment in a tight supply, demand environment, plus the agenda of productivity and innovation, we feel very strong about our ability to deliver earnings growth from where we are today. Yes. I think that we - 2021, we're going to grow significantly versus 2020. So in 2021, we are establishing this sharpening again. So if you will, maybe we can reset to that level to 2021 and we start it from here. We have a rolling five year plan, as you know, Ken that we constantly update. And we constantly make it more robust, so we can deliver earnings growth year-over-year. Thank you, Ken. Good morning, Adam. Adam, listen, we said it before, we feel very strongly about the future of our Oilseeds business. It's a business that was built traditionally in one leg, if you will, from the mill supporting all these, and we were always waiting for the oil story. The oil story, I mean, you can see that right now playing up, oil values that reach record levels, softseed margins that been the best in the last eight years, if you will. So they are supporting very good soy crush margins and great softseed margins. We invested in this many years ago, remember, with all the switch capacity, we have about give or take, 15% of our total crush capacity that can be switched from soybeans to softseed. So that's an advantage for us. And now all of a sudden, we are having this new demand that is coming because of all the sustainability trends that we discussed before with this in the form of renewable green diesel. So it just comes to strengthen our belief into this business that is very strategic for us. And to be honest, very proud of the way the business is executing. These are not easy markets to navigate with a lot of volatility, with very big values, and they are having touch wood and impeccable run. And they've done very well, given their sophistication and knowledge of - and to be honest, also the visibility that being a full value chain supplier and a global supplier gives us. So continue to work very close with our food and fuel customers and staying close to them to make sure we can read what's coming down the pipe. But again, Adam, very, very encouraged by all these developments and very happy for our strategic Oilseed business. Thank you, Adam. Good morning, Tom. Yes. So I can say we have a reasonable visibility on the Q2 for Oilseeds as we have a book build. And we stay a little bit more open for the Q3 and Q4. That's probably to the extent that I will disclose. In terms of food versus oil customers, listen, we're staying close to both. Of course, we provide - we have long-term relationships with our food customers that - we've been working with them through all these and educating them on this new demand that is coming. And we are forging new relationships with customers from renewable diesel that of course, the big issue for that industry is feedstock availability. So we're having a lot of discussions that range from the tactical to the strategic discussions with some of them as they decide on their future investments. So that's what I will describe the relationship. Yes. We've seen some softness in some of those segments. But I would say this is a little bit of a transition time in - Nutrition goes to so many applications, and depending on the geography, foodservices in some parts are coming back and in some other parts, that's still delayed. So, I would say, in general, I'm very pleased actually. Nutrition surpassed my own expectations this quarter by growing profitability by around 9% and revenue 5%. It was - the demand recovery from COVID and the impact of that in different markets is very uneven around the world, as the world is getting access to vaccination at different rates. So we are seeing that. So, as I said, this was a quarter of, remember, investment in Nutrition. So we were expecting results similar to last year. We end up delivering results that are 9% better than last year, so very happy with this. We had some specific pockets of softness, maybe some chewing gum kind of softness, some softness in some places in Animal Nutrition. But overall, very strong flavors, beverages, supplements, fibers, probiotics, specialty proteins. So, the main trends remain there. Yes. I would say, in our view, given the early planting the start that we have in the US, I think we have corn about 17%, on soybeans and about 8% at the moment. We believe that there is probably upside to the USDA numbers. So we believe that by the next time USDA will report acres, we're probably going to find maybe five more million acres, combined between soy and corn, kind of evenly split, if you will, give or take between the two. Thank you, Tom. Hi, Luke. Yes. Listen, we continue to see strong demand. I think that as some restaurants and in some places are reopening, we started to see food services coming back a little bit. To be honest, we saw that across the company, not only in soybean oil, I would say March orders were significantly better than January and February. And I think we see that continuing in April. So again, a - recovery, but we can see that. I would say, of course, green diesel customers are starting to show in demand. So we see that increase demand. So in general, we see a strong demand. In terms of disruption of demand, we haven't seen that to any degree. Probably the only example I can pinpoint is Brazil with biodiesel that reduced from B13 to B10. That's probably the only thing you can say. Things have become expensive, at least. And Brazil, as I may -- as I've mentioned, in my onset remarks, Brazil is having a very difficult time with COVID. So I think that the overall economy is suffering. And I think the government is trying to alleviate some - to alleviate a little bit the pressure on inflation there. So - but that's probably the only example I can pinpoint to at this point of demand disruption. Yes, absolutely. Listen, remember the 15% came from - we put together the five year plan. And when we see us achieving our target of $1 billion OP, basically by 2024, give or take, in order to get there, we need to grow 15%. So we were planning to start this year. And this year, it's not an exception to that. We plan 15%. When we started the year, we were planning to start the year, as I said, kind of flattish versus - and the business continue to show strength. How that strength comes part is revenue growth. Part of my confidence is given  by the pipeline. We have a strong pipeline. We are very - the team is very disciplined and religious in looking at the pipeline and looking at customer-by-customer and the projects. And that pipeline continues to grow, and our win rate continues to grow. So those are very positive indicators that your value proposition is very appreciated by our customers. Certainly, another thing that we do is that the team manage the product mix very well. And that allows us to increase profitability even in excess of the revenue growth that we see. And you know, there are different parts, while, for example, for flavors and for plant based proteins and certainly for probiotics is much more a revenue growth story. For parts like Animal Nutrition, it's more like a margin recovery story. And so we have different ways to manage this portfolio that we call nutrition, but it's a very complex portfolio. But that complexity also brings a lot of growth opportunities. And that's why it give us a confidence that it's a very balanced business from an opportunity perspective, supported by a very strong pipeline. Yes. No, listen, it was a very clean quarter. There's nothing that you should know about other than cash crush margins remain very healthy. We have a strong product demand from both meal and specialty oil. And these margins remain considerably stronger than what board crush indicates, particularly in North America and Europe. If you look at board crush in North America or Europe per month is about $25 per ton, and then we see margins on a cash basis of around $40 per ton. So there is a significant difference there. I would say, we see - as I said before, we have reasonable visibility into Q2 given the book of business we have. So we shouldn't see any surprises there, and we are expecting another good quarter of crush over there. So I mentioned before, we have our switch capacity. Softseed margins have been good. They moderated a little bit since Q1, but they continue to be very good. So oil values continue to be strong. And demand for our customers in mill in North America, our customers are enjoying good margins at this point in time. So they are trying to produce as much as they can. So we see strong demand from both lakes of the crush. So we feel good about it at the moment. Welcome. Good morning, Ben. And they have grown in the first three months of the year. They import proteins, that's up like 20% and they continue to have very strong forecast for the importation of grains to feed animals. So that's what we're seeing. Of course, corn prices have been expensive in China. And so, China has been taking as much as wheat as they can from Europe to try to make a little bit of substitution. But they also don't have infinite wheat reserves. And during this year, we think that both coal reserves and wheat reserve needs to be replenished at one point in time. We don't think that that's happening now. Nobody is replenishing inventories in the face of an inverse. But we think that, that may happen later in the year. Yes. I think that there is a portfolio of things. Some of the ones you mentioned, we are not going back to PHA. But there are some more in areas like, construction or pharma or personal care. We continue to find customers that have application development capabilities, but they want to change their input. And instead of being natural gas on oil, they want it plant-based. And for that, listen, we have - we stand on a great source of sugar that is the car solution business. We have fermentation technologies. And we have a good cost position here in the US, and as we have the capability, the critical mass. So I think that we are an attractive partner that everybody that is brainstorming or looking for a solution to match their sustainability targets is having discussions with our team. So there are some things that we cannot unveil right now, but we may unveil it over the course of the year. You're welcome. Yes. Thank you, Michael. Yes. South America, the weather in South America, of course, delayed a little bit the growth. And certainly, it's hurting a little bit the safrinha. We still expect - traditionally, April and May are dry weather months in Brazil. So that's not great for this. And that's what putting a little bit of the premium in - the weather premium on corn. So we expect that crop to be a little bit smaller. And Brazil exports about 35% of their corn production. So that is an impact in the market. What are we rooting for? We are rooting for larger crops. We like to move crops. So the soy crop is expected to be a good one, maybe 135 million, 136 million tons, so that's in check. And I think what Brazil is doing at the moment is maybe getting a little bit of corn from Argentina. Certainly, it's getting wheat to try to replace some of the corn in feeding. Because adjusted, as I said before, the B13 bio-diesel to B10. So it's a year in which Brazil needs to navigate with - on very tight stocks. And so it's going to be a difficult year and a year of heavy management for the Brazilian, the crush and the grain side of this. Yes. I think that, of course, the farmer react to pricing. And although - this may be too late to shift a lot of acres to corn, given how late we are already. I think, first of all, they will try to plant as much as possible next year as well, given prices will continue to be elevated. I think, listen, as it gets tied the market, that's an advantage of our value chain. Our procurement, our long value chain, the fact that we have such a good coverage of everywhere, in a tight market, that's where our footprint shines and we get the competitive advantage, if you will. So we like to have more crops. But in periods in which crops are going to be tied, we have a good system to make sure we get our hands into the crops. And because of sometimes basis go up. But to be honest, given the strong demand and the good profitability of our customers, I think we will be able to price those in. So I think that we are looking constructively about in terms of margins for the future. It's too early to tell. And there are too many factors. I mean, we are still trying to plant, we haven't planted like 10% of our crop, it's difficult to speculate about the 2022 crop here. Good morning, Ben. Thank you. Hi, Eric. Yes. Eric listen, we think as I said before that the US continues to be competitive in the second quarter for corn exports, so we're going to see some of those exports. As Ray was saying before, Ag Services probably innovation margin will not be the same because we won't have the same program of soybean on top of that. China continues to be buying everything they can, they are buying corn, but they are buying wheat as I said before, from several places and we have certain weather sports in the world. Canada and France are too cold and too dry, that has put some pressure on wheat with all this demand. Australia's infrastructure is trying to recover from a cyclone, so the exploitability of wheat there is also a little bit limited for loading that has created some pressure. So, for the moment corn continues to be competitive, the US exporting corn, but pretty soon it will become landed in China a little bit more expensive than wheat and then - but then we're getting tighter because of the bad weather. So we are looking at all those dynamics. So it's very difficult to answer this tough question specifically, but that's what I will think that all day is looking at all those dynamics and making sure we alter our product flows to fit the best origin. Yes. Listen, I think the administration has shown from the beginning that of course, fighting climate change was going to be one of their priorities, which we support. And we have a strong sustainability program. I think that we need to start working on - and it's important to work very closely with the farmers to try to listen to - the farmer understands the responsibility. We have at the moment maybe 25% of acres doing precision agriculture, which I think will increase yield without needing more land. And I think that there will be a discussion with the administration and it will be a pressure between environmental long-term goals and short term feeding needs of the world. The world needs the US capacity as they need the Brazilian capacity, so these prices show that we need those acres. So I think that this cannot be automatic, is something that we will have to work out balancing all the stakeholders, people that need the food or with the long term needs for conserving the planet. Thank you, Eric."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide eight, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered an outstanding quarter with operating profit of $777 million, representing a record for a first quarter. Ag Services results were substantially higher year-over-year. Results were driven by a record Q1 for our North American origination team, which executed extremely well to capitalize on strong Chinese demand. As expected, results in South America were significantly lower versus the prior year period. Farmer selling was lower versus the extremely aggressive pace in the year ago quarter. Lower margins, including the impacts from the slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs also affected South American results. Results for the quarter were affected by about $75 million in negative timing related to ocean freight position. Those impacts will reverse as contracts execute in the coming quarters. Crushing delivered its best quarter ever, as the business leverage its global footprint and diversified capabilities to capture strong execution margins in both soybean and softseed crushing, driven by robust vegetable oil demand and tight soybean stocks. Net timing impacts for the quarter in crush were minimal. Well, first of all, the balance sheet is what I consider one of the greatest assets of ADM. And while inventories have actually increased 50% compared to March of last year, we still have significant available credit capacity to undertake actions, right? And so I think the first priority is continue to fund the working capital needs. It's not a surprise. Commodity prices continue to go up right now. And so therefore, we will use our balance sheet to kind of fund additional working capital requirements. And - but secondly, we have flexibility to do whatever we need to do from a strategic perspective. As you know, in prior periods, during higher commodity prices, there are distressed assets in the marketplace. And so to the extent that there are distressed assets that make sense for us to acquire in order to consolidate, we'll look at those. That's one of the big advantages of our ADM balance sheet. So - but we all know that eventually commodity prices will come down, and that will free up additional capital on the balance sheet. And then we can look at additional incremental returns on capital to our shareholders at that point in time. But again, the dividend, we've increased the dividend. That's an important element of return on capital to our shareholders. But I'm convinced that our balance sheet because we all know prices go through cycles, there will be a release of working capital at some juncture that will again free up significant capacity for us to take additional return of capital actions. Hey, Tom. Hey, Luke. Yes, Ben. So let me improve  reverse order. So net corn cost was a tailwind for us. I mean, clearly, as we pointed out in the last earnings call, we actually procured a lot of our requirements at a very attractive price last year. And hence, we benefit from basically a very good procurement. And hence, net corn was a tailwind for us, despite the fact that when you look at the board, corn costs are higher right now. With respect to the question on disaggregating Starches and Sweeteners from ethanol, my only comment is one of the big improvements in Starches and Sweeteners in the quarter compared to last quarter, last year's first quarter was the fact that we didn't have the corn oil mark-to-market impact. If you recall last year, we had about a $50 million negative impact due to the corn oil divergence from soybean oil. We didn't have it this year. So that was clearly a tailwind in terms of our results. From a volume perspective, when you look at the Starches and Sweetener business right now, we're still - we're certainly looking, I'm looking at corn - high fructose corn syrup. And corn syrup, we're still down versus last year. So we are suffering from the impact of the pandemic and because the foodservice sector is not fully recovered, we indicated that we're starting to see elements of recovery in the month of March. But from a volume perspective, in the first quarter, total Sweetener volumes are still down versus last year, right? So therefore, that's kind of like a headwind. But we expect that to progressively recover as we move through the year. So I guess, overall, I mean, we've been actually pretty pleased in terms of the performance. Given this particular headwind we had in the first quarter, we were very pleased in terms of how we manage the business, favorable net corn procurement, favorable risk management. And frankly, even with the cold weather impacts that we had in the first quarter, we were able to keep on delivering to our customers, which is very, very important. Yes. For Ag Services, seasonally, Q2 will be lower than Q1, right? I mean that's what happens. I mean North America, we had a very strong Q1 in terms of North American exports. Again, partly as Juan indicated, a delayed South American harvest. It allowed the export window in North America to really benefit. And then we just had significant demand pull, which resulted in very strong elevation margins in the first quarter. So second quarter for Ag Services, it will revert back to more of a normal level here. The demand environment is still good, but it's not going to be as stellar as what we saw in the first quarter. On your question on timing differences, remember, this is a question, right? I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's about $75 million related to global trade and ocean freight that will reverse over the course of the year. In the appendix, the timing effects referred to in the appendix are related to crush. And just a reminder, in the first quarter, we didn't see much of a reversal in the first quarter, despite the fact that we had at the end of 2020, about $295 million in timing effects. And the reason being is that while we're seeing some reversals occurring, we're also building up new timing effects, because as you know, cash crush remains extremely strong. So some of the new contracts we're putting on, we're actually creating new timing effects. And so I just want to just kind of caution people that in this type of environment, even though there's about like $265 million of timing effects yet to unwind because of new timing effects that will likely occur over the course of the year, we may not see the full unwind occur this year. So that's just my only caution I want to provide listeners to the call on these timing effects. Thank you. Yes. So in my prepared remarks, I did say that we're likely going to have lower Ag Services results this year, second quarter compared to last year, right. So - don't forget, remember, last year, we were benefiting a lot from South America, a farmer selling, right, and that was extremely strong last year first quarter, but particularly second quarter. So we're not going to see that impact this year, so that's going to be the primary driver as to why Ag Services. This year Q2 will be lower than last year's Q2. Thanks. Hi, Eric."

I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\nMegan Britt: Thank you. Hello and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings webcast for ADM. Starting tomorrow, a replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website. Please turn to Slide 2, which says that some of our comments and materials constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the presentation. To the extent permitted, under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. On today\u2019s webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will discuss our full year accomplishments and share detail on our priorities for 2023. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar, will review the drivers of our financial performance at the segment level and review our cash generation and capital allocation results. Juan will have closing remarks regarding our planning framework for 2023 and then he and Vikram will take your questions. Please turn to Slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Megan. This morning, we reported very strong fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.93. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. Our full year adjusted EPS of $7.85, adjusted segment operating profit of $6.6 billion, and trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC of 13.6% demonstrate once again the great work of our global team of dedicated colleagues who manage unprecedented market disruptions to deliver an outstanding year. Our full year operating cash flow before working capital was $5.3 billion. This strong cash flow and the disciplined management of our balance sheet allow us to continue to reinvest in our business, with $1.3 billion in capital expenditures and return cash to shareholders. In total, we returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases in 2022. Next slide, please. With the expectation of continued strong cash flow, today, we are announcing a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share. We are proud of our record of 91 years of uninterrupted dividends and 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. And I\u2019d like to thank our shareholders for their continued support of ADM. Next slide, please. When I examine 2022, our ability to drive structural growth in earnings and improvement in ROIC was supported by key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise, particularly the progress we made on our productivity and innovation objectives. Our productivity work in 2022 included enhancing our operational resilience, including through stabilizing our plant operations and streamlining our operating systems. In order to meet growing customer demand and drive efficiencies, we delivered multiple projects to enhance our operational footprint, from modernization to improving and scheduled downtime to capacity expansions. We completed our Marshall, Minnesota modernization, opened a new mill house in Clinton, completed our Quincy refinery expansion and improved output and yields at our Rondonopolis diesel plant in Brazil. We also continued to optimize our North American milling footprint. As you know, we also introduced a new $1 billion challenge in 2022. There is no clearer demonstration of how our colleagues and culture are driving returns than the fact that thousands of ADM team members from around the globe took the initiative, step up and identified opportunities that unlocked more than $1.6 billion in cash in 2022. On innovation, our accomplishments include a focus on capturing the benefits of organic growth investments and M&A as we continue to get closer to our customers and extend our capabilities to meet growing global demand for our products. Our Nutrition business continued to outpace the industry, with 18% constant currency revenue growth for the full year. We delivered an impressive 26% in year-over-year revenue growth in BioSolutions. The portfolio of acquisitions we made in the prior year continued to deliver OP above our financial projections and we advanced targeted production capacity expansions to meet growing customer demand. We announced expansions of our alternative protein capabilities in Decatur, Illinois, and starch production in Marshall, Minnesota. We completed our alternative protein expansion in Serbia and are able to launch our expanded probiotic capacity in Valencia, Spain. And we continue to expect our joint venture crush and refining facility in North Dakota to be operational by this year\u2019s harvest. Slide 6 please. Now let\u2019s look ahead. We have a robust plan for driving enduring value creation in 2023 and beyond. In productivity, our work has a common theme, changing the way we work by standardizing, digitizing and automating our manufacturing plants and our offices alike. I previously mentioned our successful Marshall modernization. That was the blueprint for our wider work to unlock value across our production footprint through enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics. We have now approved the scope for the first 2 years of the program, encompassing 18 manufacturing facilities. We continue to expect double-digit returns from this important initiative. And we are continuing to advance 1ADM, which is enabling us to improve our processes and expand capabilities across the value chain. 2022 was an important year for our 1ADM business transformation. We completed several rollouts and we are seeing benefits in areas ranging from indirect procurement to go-to-market strategies to grain merchandising. In 2023, we will continue to expand the breadth and scope of this work, which is empowering our businesses to deliver profitable revenue growth and higher margins. Next, we are focused on maintaining our structural growth momentum via our innovation work. As you might recall, we have spoken in the past about our strategic growth platforms: sustainability, differentiated grain, alternative proteins, BioSolutions, microbial solutions and microbiome modification. These growth opportunities go through a natural evolution. When new, we launch them at the corporate level. As they mature, they become more embedded in our businesses. Differentiated grain is now firm part of our Ag Services and Oilseeds segments everyday work. BioSolutions is growing within carbohydrate solutions. Alternative proteins and microbiome are pillars of nutrition. With these efforts maturing in the businesses, we are able to focus on other opportunities. One of the most important is decarbonization, which is a critical component of our sustainability growth platform and is driving the evolution of our carbohydrate solutions business. Our goal is to reduce the carbon intensity of our assets and value chain in order to be the preferred partner in low-carbon intensity feedstocks for a growing demand base. We have made several announcements to mark milestones towards this goal in recent years, including our regenerative agriculture efforts, which enrolled 1 million unique acres over the past year; our Strive 35 goals; our initiatives to connect and expand our carbon capture and storage capabilities; and our heat and energy project indicator. We are looking at multiple other pathways to reducing our carbon intensity, like more sustainable energy sources for our facilities. And our efforts aren\u2019t just in the U.S. We have plans for other regions as well, including some EMEA projects we hope to speak about in the future. All of these projects contribute to our ability to offer low carbon intensity feedstocks and that is allowing us to continue to advance our work to transition our dry mills to produce sustainable aviation fuel; help scale up the scaled food products with new sustainable attributes, like the ingredients we will sell to Pepsi from the regenerative agriculture agreement we announced last year, and propelled the expansion of BioSolutions with joint ventures like with LG Chem. And even as we advance our decarbonization plan, we are always looking at new ways to help solve our world\u2019s challenges for food security, health and well-being and sustainability. For example, we are continuing to explore opportunities around precision fermentation, which we used to call microbial solutions, in which microbes rapidly grown in fermenters fed by dextrose, transform the sugars into a wide variety of products for food, feed and fiber. That\u2019s a longer term horizon for ADM, but it gives us a hint of the kind of opportunities we see in the years ahead. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?\nVikram Luthar: Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 7. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year with substantially higher year-over-year results in Q4. Ag Services results were higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Low water conditions reduced North American export volumes, partially offset by the South American team, which executed well to deliver higher margins and volumes. Global trade results were lower than the strong fourth quarter of 2021 with lower ocean freight results partially offset by higher results in EMEA origination and destination marketing. The business benefited from a $110 million legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Reserve Louisiana Export facility. Crushing results were more than double those of the prior year period. In North America, strong export volumes for soybean meal and growing domestic demand for renewable diesel contributed to strong margins. In EMEA, oil demand powered strong rapeseed margins more than offsetting higher energy costs compared to the prior year. Expanding margins drove negative timing impacts in the quarter of approximately $40 million. RPO results were significantly higher year-over-year as the business continued to execute well to meet demand for food oil, renewable diesel in the U.S. and biodiesel globally. Equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Looking ahead, we expect AS&O results for Q1 to remain strong, similar to last year\u2019s very strong quarter led by continued strength in crush margins and RPO. Ag Services is likely to be lower year-over-year, particularly in light of very strong global trade results in the prior year quarter. Slide 8, please. Carbohydrate Solutions had a strong 2022, with full year results higher than 2021. For the quarter, results were substantially lower than the fourth quarter of 2021 due to pressured industry ethanol margins. The starches and sweeteners sub-segment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much higher year-over-year results. The North America business delivered solid volumes and strong margins in both starches and sweeteners, partially offsetting lower ethanol margins. The EMEA team effectively managed risk and delivered improved results on better margins in a continued dynamic environment. The global wheat milling business delivered higher margins driven by solid customer demand. Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially lower as higher ethanol inventory levels pressured margins especially compared to the very strong margin environment in the fourth quarter of 2021. Looking at the first quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions, we expect continued solid demand and strong margins for starches, sweeteners and wheat flour. Ethanol margins are currently pressured due to high industry inventory levels. If industry stocks come back down, results for the quarter could be similar to Q1 of 2022. If margins remain pressured, results would likely be lower. On Slide 9, the Nutrition business continued its strong growth trajectory in 2022. ADM demonstrated that it remains the provider of choice in Nutrition for systems as our growing pipeline and continued strong win rates delivered full year revenue growth of 18% on a constant currency basis. The business continued to outperform industry growth levels and delivered 11% higher profits for the full year on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, revenues grew 11% on a constant currency basis. Q4 operating profits were significantly lower than the prior year quarters. Human Nutrition results were lower than those of the fourth quarter of 2021. Flavors results were similar to the prior year as strong revenue growth helped offset demand fulfillment challenges. Specialty Ingredients continued to see strong demand for its product portfolio, including plant-based proteins, offset by inventory adjustments. Health & Wellness was higher year-over-year, driven primarily by the bioactives portfolio, including the results from the Deerland acquisition. Animal results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the lower margins in amino acids, driven by recovery in the global supply of lysine. Pet Nutrition volumes were lower in Latin America, partially driven by demand fulfillment challenges. Feed results were stronger driven by APAC and Latin America partially offset by the impact of softer demand in EMEA. As we look ahead, we expect overall Nutrition results in Q1 to be lower than the prior year\u2019s record first quarter, with Human Nutrition delivering similar year-over-year results on strong flavors and SI growth and lower Animal Nutrition results primarily due to weaker margins in amino acids. I want to take a moment to expand on our view of Nutrition in 2023. Nutrition is expected to continue on a positive growth trajectory for full year 2023, including 10% plus profit growth and a similar level of revenue growth. The growth is likely to be led by Human Nutrition and to be weighted in the back half of the year as the first half will see headwinds in Animal Nutrition due to the continued impacts of weaker margins in amino acids and because we will see increasing recovery in demand fulfillment as we move through the year. Slide 10, please. Other business results for Q4 was significantly higher than the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM investor services, and captive insurance experienced favorable underwriting results and lower claim settlements versus the prior year. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $299 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company\u2019s centers of excellence related to growth initiatives. Other corporate was favorable versus the prior year primarily due to higher contributions from foreign currency-related hedge activity and lower railroad maintenance expense. Corporate results also included losses related to the mark-to-market adjustment on the Wilmar exchangeable bond and severance totaling $6 million. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher interest rates. We expect corporate cost for 2023 to be around $1.5 billion, driven primarily by inflation and higher interest expense. Other business performance should be higher than 2022, offsetting a significant portion of the increased corporate costs as higher interest rates positively impact our ADM IS business. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was approximately 16% compared to 21% in the prior year. The decreased rate was driven primarily by changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings in addition to lower discrete tax expense versus the prior year. Our full year adjusted tax rate was 17%. For 2023, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. Year-to-date operating cash flows before working capital of $5.3 billion are up significantly versus $3.9 billion over the same period last year. Our net debt to total capital ratio is about 25%, and we continue to have ample available liquidity. Our strong cash flows and balance sheet have enabled continued investment in the business, with $1.3 billion in capital expenditures for the full year. We currently plan to maintain capital expenditures at about $1.3 billion in 2023 and continue to have significant financial capacity to pursue strategic growth objectives. We have been continuing to return capital to shareholders. We distributed $900 million in dividends and repurchased almost $1.5 billion of shares in 2022. We are planning $1 billion in opportunistic buybacks for 2023, subject to other strategic uses of capital. Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vikram. Next slide, please. 2022 was a truly outstanding year for ADM. As we look forward to 2023, we expect another very strong year. There are a number of market factors that we see as relevant for shipping our performance. We still see tightness in supply and demand balances in key products and regions. We see strong demand for vegetable oil, driven largely but robust demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel. Resilient food demand should drive higher volumes and margins in starches, sweeteners and wheat milling. We see continued strong demand for ethanol, including positive discretionary blending economics. And as Vikram mentioned, we expect 10% plus constant currency OP growth from Nutrition. We have a strong playbook powered by our deep expertise and our unparalleled footprint and capabilities to manage a dynamic market environment. Our healthy balance sheet provides ongoing optionality as we continue to pull the levers under our control to deliver results. And we expect positive contributions from productivity and innovation initiatives across the company that will help us drive value in 2023. Taken together, we expect to deliver another very strong year in 2023. With that, Bailey, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: So I want to ask in the Nutrition segment. Your guidance, I think, Juan, you said 10% growth in constant currency. Two questions I have. One is at the current exchange rate levels, what would that imply in just a reported growth rate? And then secondarily, just thinking strategically, you\u2019re talking about some of the expansions that you\u2019re making in organic growth investment. What does your appetite for M&A look like in that segment? And how fertile is the landscape for potential M&A?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Ben. Listen, that business has been a very successful story at the customer level for many, many years. We continue to drive higher growth rates than the industry we participate in. So that has not changed, the robust pipeline growth there, and we have achieved all that then through a very disciplined strategy of bolt-on acquisitions and organic growth. So we did 4 bolt-ons in 2021. We took the time in 2022 to integrate them and digest them. At the same time, in 2022, we started many projects that I highlighted in my initial comments on organic growth. So I would say that will be the pattern that you should expect to us. I mean we have stated many years in our balanced capital allocation, and in this nutrition pace, if you will, of bolt-on and M&A and taking some time to digest some of those things. Very pleased to report that the four acquisitions we made in 2021 are executing or delivering ahead of their business model. So we\u2019re not planning to change the pace or the strategy that we have had so far. The projects that we are making selective expansions on or bringing to life soon are all going well even despite the long time \u2013 long lead time equipment and sometimes you face in the industry. We\u2019ve done that in anticipation of all that. So we feel very good about being able to support, with capacity, the growth in demand that we see in the marketplace from our participations.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. And the question on the constant currency versus reported any color you can offer there at current exchange rates?\nVikram Luthar: Yes. So effectively, Ben, we don\u2019t assume a lot of change in currency for 2023. Yes, you\u2019ve seen some weakness in the U.S. dollar, but you can assume that, even on a reported basis right now, we assume similar growth rates in OP.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, great. Can I ask one follow-up or is that too greedy?\nJuan Luciano: Go ahead, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. I actually want to shift gears a little bit and pivots to Starches and Sweeteners, that business was fantastic in the quarter. Your forward commentary sounded quite constructive as well. Could you give us a little bit more color on how you see that evolving into 2023? And do you think you can achieve margin expansion there?\nVikram Luthar: So based on the customer contracting we\u2019ve seen in the Sweeteners and Starches portfolio, Ben, we do see strong volumes and margins. And with the improved mix, we talked about BioSolutions expansion, we actually have 26% year-on-year growth, and BioSolution margin remained very robust. And with the improved mix we actually see a potential, in the Sweeteners and Starches business, to have higher volumes and margins in 2023. Clearly, ethanol remains uncertain and we\u2019ve seen recently inventory levels remain high, and that\u2019s actually pretty similar to January of last year as well. But we\u2019re still constructive in terms of outlook for ethanol, given what\u2019s happening with the RVO framework, the fact that gasoline demand is expected to be roughly flat versus 2022, blending economics remain very favorable. And frankly, export volume should be similar to last year, around 1.4 billion gallons. So that\u2019s a quick snapshot of our outlook for 2023.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi, yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: So I wanted to hopefully tie together some of the forward comments that you made and see just to help calibrate kind of us on the net impact of that at the earnings level. So Nutrition is going to have kind of 10% constant currency profit growth, not much FX right now. Other \u2013 and other and corporate and interest kind of basically seemingly netting out to roughly flat year-over-year. Tax rate, flat to maybe up slightly year-over-year. So I guess the two pieces of the puzzle that are missing from their Ag Services and Oilseeds profit in Carbohydrate Solutions. I think ethanol remains somewhat of a wildcard on carbohydrates, although the rest of Starches and Sweeteners, you sound generally constructive. So can you help us, Juan, Vikram, just thinking about kind of a range of outcomes on Ag Services and Oilseeds based on where crush margins are today kind of assuming, let\u2019s say, an average U.S. crop, no enormous supply dislocation coming out of the U.S. in the second half of the year? Just how kind of the profit outlook would be tracking in Ag Services and Oilseeds, and if there is anything else on a year-on-year basis, you want us to be considering, that would be really helpful.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Adam. I think you captured the situation well. I think we continue to see a very strong margin environment in Ag Services and Oilseeds. 2022, we hit in all cylinders. I think that every piece of our business hit records. When we look at the 2023, we continue to see very strong demand. If you look at North America, North America had a strong meal demand and certainly very strong domestic demand for oil, driven by all the factors, driven by sustainability that you know. We see a strong potential for crush margins in Europe, given the bad crop in Argentina and the fact that Europe will continue to export biodiesel to the U.S. given the need that we have here. So all in all, we continue to see strength. Certainly, RPO, we\u2019re going to see the strong demand. Biodiesel and all that is going \u2013 we\u2019re seeing strong margins and very good volumes for next year. We do have visibility into this \u2013 into the next year, given our book, so we feel good about that business. As Vikram mentioned in the commentary may be Ag Services that we\u2019re planning it a little bit slower than last year, given the exceptional results that we had last year. And \u2013 but as difficult as it is to pinpoint a number, Adam, given that we have China uncertainty, war that has been going on for a year and, certainly, weather events, that we still need to build the U.S. crop, and we still need to finish the Latin American crops. I would say we favor more range scenarios. And in the range of scenarios, 2023, falls into a very strong range for us. So I don\u2019t know \u2013 I will not venture to pinpoint a specific number, but certainly strong range. When you go to Carb Solutions, when we talk to our customers, demand for the products is stable. We\u2019ve been able to have strong margins in all that, whether it\u2019s sweeteners and starches or whether it\u2019s wheat milling. When we look at BioSolutions, it continues to grow, like 26% of revenue. And then we see EBITDA margins in the 20% for that business, which is a very profitable business that is growing their contribution into Carb Solutions as part of the total UP. So that is a business that Vikram called the question mark of \u2013 the more volatile part of it probably is ethanol. And that\u2019s \u2013 right now, like a little bit like in the last year, we start with this time of the year with low margins. And \u2013 but we think that we\u2019re going to have very good incentive for people to blend ethanol, the numbers are there. RINs balances are tight, will encourage people to blend. So I think that given the prices that they have, I think that expecting export in the range of 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion gallons per year is reasonable. And you saw these days, Petrobras in Brazil, increasing the gasoline prices by 7%, so they are going to be less flow from there to here in all these. So we\u2019re still planning for a little bit softer, maybe Carb Solutions in light of our ethanol forecast. But conditions are \u2013 could change in ethanol and it could make it a close year. So all in all, we continue to see a very strong year for 2023.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBen Theurer: Thank you very much. Good morning, Juan. Good morning, Vikram.\nJuan Luciano: Hi, Ben.\nVikram Luthar: Good morning.\nBen Theurer: Just wanted to quickly follow-up on the Nutrition dynamics you seen in the fourth quarter and how that translated into 1Q and somehow if you could frame it for that medium-term growth algorithm you\u2019ve laid out a little over a year ago during your Capital Markets update. So fair to assume that there was obviously a lot of specific issues around fulfillment, some very specific demand items that kind of impacted in the fourth quarter, and you expect this, obviously, to continue into the first half and then recover into the second half. Now clearly, the 10% you\u2019ve laid out and what you\u2019ve talked about of growth in 2023 is kind of below the algorithm. So can you help us frame how \u201823 kind of fits within your \u201825 strategy and where you want to go? Is that just a small dip can then be recovered? Or would you need some M&A to get back on track to the target of 1.2 at least by 2025, so that we understand how to think about the specific headwinds that can potentially be offset versus what might be more of a structural challenge within Nutrition?\nVikram Luthar: Yes, Ben, in terms of Q4, the issues that affected Q4, I\u2019d say, are kind of a little more temporary, right, that we think we will be able to work through over the course of 2023, as I talked about. Specifically, what\u2019s important for you to know that the demand is very, very strong, right? So that is \u2013 we talked about the strongest-ever pipeline in the Human Nutrition business and very strong win rates. So across every category that we play in, almost we\u2019ve got strong demand. Yes, there is some softening in certain parts of the business, right? We are aware of dietary supplements that being a little softer. Plant-based protein growth may moderate a bit from the pace we\u2019ve seen historically. But nevertheless, our growth has been very strong in Human Nutrition. The challenge we\u2019ve had is the demand fulfillment. That\u2019s going to take us a while to address and overcome. Animal Nutrition, on the other hand, we benefited from strong margins in lysine, but in Q4, the compression in margins were sharper and faster than we expected, and that\u2019s going to continue over the course of 2023. So we\u2019ve got to offset that plus drive growth, and that\u2019s what gives us a slightly below trend line growth for 2023 around 10% plus. Having said that, the outlook remains robust. And maybe, Juan, do you want to talk about the 2025 perspective?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Vikram. Ben, listen, I think we have been \u2013 you have been witnessing how we built this nutrition business over the years. This is a business that, if I take over the last 3 years, it has been growing OP by 20%, CAGR if you will. So, it\u2019s a business that we continue to add layers of capabilities so we can continue to win at the customer front, whether it is we go from individual ingredients to systems, where we bring functionality to those systems through bioactives, whether we bring sustainability benefits to that through our decarbonization or regen Ag. So, we continue to add layers to continue to help customers excel at the consumer level. And we see that in our win rates, and we see that in our pipeline. So, we have visibility into that. As Vikram said, maybe some of the categories soften a little bit, but our ability to gain share, to win faster than those categories, has been demonstrated. I think this year, we grew revenue significantly higher than the market. So, when we look forward, as I said in my \u2013 I think one of the earlier answers, we continue to expect bolt-on and M&A \u2013 bolt-on M&A and organic growth. We had four companies in 2021. We are building capabilities and new capacity in 2022 that we are going to see on the stream in \u201823, and we are going to continue to grow that. So, we haven\u2019t deviated from our 2025 plan. And I don\u2019t think it will require massive M&A to achieve there. It will \u2013 you will see this steady state. But this is a business that we are building in the middle of a lot of volatility in the market. This is of course, versus the legacy ADM business, it\u2019s more complex in the number of SKUs that we have, in the number of customers that we have, in the number of plants and categories that we manage. So, when supply chain issues happen or market volatility happen, it\u2019s a little bit more complex to fix in this business. And that\u2019s why we expect a first half that\u2019s going to be a little bit subdued when you add the demand fulfillment issues and some of the capability building, with the fact that also lysine is coming down, if you will, in prices, at least for the moment. So, I would say nothing that deviated. Certainly, if you ask me personally, and I think the management team, are we happy with Q4, I mean of course, Q4 underperformed our own expectations. I mean that\u2019s nothing new for a business that, again, has been growing 20% per year CAGR. And \u2013 but we think that this is just a trajectory in the business that continued to win faster than what the market gives us at this point in time. We don\u2019t expect a deviation to our long-term plan at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nManav Gupta: Congrats on the beat and the dividend hike, shareholder returns matter and you have continuously rewarded your shareholders. My quick question here is, and you have kind of alluded to it also is we are seeing a lot of new capacity start up on the renewable diesel side. I think major projects starting up even last quarter. And then your outlook for both soybean oil and soybean meal, it seems pretty strong right now, any risks to that? And how do you see the year progressing from the perspective of both soybean oil and soybean meal?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Manav. Thank you for the question. We continued to see very strong demand across the world, not only for all the oils. I think that if you take the four oils, demand is running harder than production, if you will, globally. So, even I would say before renewable green diesel happened, we had already a tight balance sheet from an oils perspective, and that has continued. When you think about the capacity that renewable green diesel is installing, it\u2019s going to have a huge pull in soybean oil. And we have found that there is \u2013 we have found relatively easy to place the mill in the export markets. And if you look at the market overall, the meal market is a market of like 175 million metric tons and growing. So, if you calculate by 2026, we need to have 20 million tons more soybean meal, just to catch up with the demand. And if you look at everything that we are building through the RGD and the capacity expansions, we are estimating about 15 million tons of supply on soybean meal. So, it\u2019s still we have \u2013 we are still covered in only 75% of the expected soybean meal demand out there. So, we are looking at this as you can understand very carefully. Remember, as I always mentioned, it took us 2 years to assess Spiritwood and start building it. I am happy to report that is going to come online for the harvest. So, I would say we look at this, but the demand on both sides on the soybean meal and soybean oil clearly can support all this capacity. So, we continued to see an environment in which crush margins will be strong and highly supportive for many, many years.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSalvator Tiano: Yes. Thank you very much. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Steve. So, firstly, I wanted to ask a little bit about China and specifically, you mentioned mill demand. So, a little bit short and long-term view. In the short-term, I guess the re-openings there, etcetera, do you see actually a positive momentum for demand for soybean meal or soybeans versus what you saw in the past couple of years with COVID zero? And then long-term actually is we have been reading how Chinese population dropped last year, essentially, it seems to have peaked much than it\u2019s expected. And there are articles talking about what could be the long-term trajectory of food demand there, including protein demand and therefore, what would be the demand for feed. So, how are you seeing the long-term outlook in China for soybean meal and other products that you make?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you. Good questions. So, on the short-term part of the question, we see China will continue to increase imports. If you look at domestic grain prices are at historically high levels, especially now that we are \u2013 that they are reopening. Of course, a reopening of China could be a game changer for a variety of commodities, not just grains. We look at domestic vegetable oil stocks have been at relatively low levels. And we have seen, during the second half of 2022, an increase in domestic pork prices since, I would say, last spring. So, that prompted farmers to increase their herd. So, we see that demand in the short-term. But again, I think the variability here may be on the upside on how much of the reopening is bringing people to consumption. Of course, people have been in lockdown almost for 2 years in China. And there is a \u2013 you are going to find the same pent-up demand that we saw ourselves maybe since last year when everybody came out of COVID. So, I think at this point in time, short-term, China will be probably a positive upside, if anything, to our forecast. When you look at the long-term and the demographics of China that you described, probably about 50% of the Chinese population is middle class or what you will consider middle class, and they are in this process of increasing their protein consumption. But still historically, if you look at what the U.S., we consume about 270 pounds per year of proteins. China is at the 170 pounds per year level. So, they are still far from our level of consumption. And again, if you look at our lifestyles are converging slowly. So, you will expect their protein per capita consumption to grow significantly during this period. The other thing you need to remember is that we are still going to be 10 billion people in the planet by 2050, which is one of the issues that serves our \u2013 or drives our purpose, which is trying to increase the carrying capacity of the planet, trying to feed all that. And whether it\u2019s in China or whether it\u2019s in Africa or whether it\u2019s in Southeast Asia, we are a global company, we have a global footprint, and you have seen us continue to expand our destination marketing footprint to serve customers around the world. So, we will serve \u2013 we will serve the feeding of growing population of the world, whether it\u2019s in China or somewhere else. But as I said, I don\u2019t expect China to have a decline in the next probably two decades in terms of their demand for protein consumption.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you. I was hoping to get a little more detail on your forward outlook for ASO. In the slides in the pack, you indicated that the front month board crush is at $75 a ton, and that\u2019s lower than where it was on your third quarter growth [ph]. Does that influence your outlook for forward crush and the fact that it\u2019s come down a bit? And how can I relate that to what happened in calendar \u201822?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Rob, I couldn\u2019t hear you very well, but I get the gist of the question. So, listen, I think at this point in time \u2013 and as I said before, we have visibility for probably the first quarter and big part of the first half, 2023 will be another strong year for crush, certainly above the long-term guidance that we provided at our global Investor Day. We also are planning to have an improvement in our process volumes that given some of the operational resilience initiatives. And we are going to have Spiritwood online in Q4. And hopefully, by in a couple of \u2013 maybe in a couple of weeks and a month, we will resume crush in Paraguay. We continue to have good crush margins in Europe. Certainly, Europe will be helped by the small crop in Argentina. Also, I think energy prices have moderated a little bit in Europe given the warm summer. So, we are also shifting in Europe as much to soybean crush as we can as there is margin there. We are also going to have this year that we didn\u2019t have last year, better canola margins. Canola crush margins certainly and now that we have a Canadian crop, are more in the $120 to $140 per ton in North America, maybe $70 to $75 in Europe. So, I would say, we are having good crush rates. We are having good mill export demand in the U.S. We are having very strong soybean oil demand here in the U.S. So, I will say, in general, we don\u2019t see any clouds in the horizon for crush. The crush business will have a very strong year in 2023. As I have said before, Rob, I wouldn\u2019t pinpoint a specific number given the China reopening, given the issues in Ukraine that whether it\u2019s not driving crush margins that may drive energy prices. And certainly, the crops, we are expecting that Brazil needs to have a big crop that will offset the decline in Argentina. And we hope that the U.S. will have a big crop as well, but we still need to go through the weather in both instances. So, again, I will just reiterate a very strong environment for crush as far as we can see.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Eric Larson from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nEric Larson: Yes. Thanks. Thank you and congratulations on a great year, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you.\nEric Larson: So, yes, my question comes down to, we have talked a lot about the bean markets globally and domestically here. But one of the big kind of hangovers right now in the grain market is corn demand. And obviously, I think Brazil is going to be running out of corn here pretty quickly. We may have seen some new Chinese demand coming in here for corn. But how do you look at \u2013 and we have been on competitive, I think just from a currency basis \u2013 from everything else. But could you talk a little bit, Juan, about the corn market and how you see the export situation with that particular commodity?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I think you called it well. I think that when we had the low water levels in the Q4 that hurt us, of course, we lost some bean business. But the corn business basically is going to be with us until the crop in Brazil \u2013 the harvest in Brazil comes, so it\u2019s like middle of the year. So, we see that as a very strong business in Ag services for North America. We also have, unfortunately, I think Ukraine Grain Association has come up with a statement that they don\u2019t believe corn for \u201823 will exceed 18 million tons, which is a far cry from the 29 million tons or 30 million tons that they used to produce or we expected. So, demand continues to be solid out there. And we still \u2013 as a world, we need Brazil to have a good crop. Of course, if there are rains and delay a little bit the harvest of soybeans, that may delay a little bit the planting of the next crop. But we hope that in your farm and everybody\u2019s farm, corn is growing strongly because we need it. And again, the U.S. will be exporting a lot of that from here until probably July.\nOperator: The final question today comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to ask about the press release that was out a couple of days ago about the new biostimulant of ADM released, the data for rating sold. And I know that you do have a business where you work with farmers to provide them fertilizers, etcetera. But I think this seems to be the first time that you are actually rolling out one of your own proprietary products. So, I am just trying to understand a little bit about your strategy here. Will you invest more in products for nutrition and crop protection, especially biologicals? And what do you think is the potential market and actually the earnings potential for ADM?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you for the question. Listen, I think that we continued to enlarge our relationships with customers, but also with farmers. And as we continue to increase our digital engagement with them, we also increased the bartering and exchange of many, many products. And we have a good relationship with farmers. We have the trust of the farmers, and so every now and then, they bring challenges to us. And I think the challenges of biologicals, if you will, given that we have some work in precision fermentation and things like that is, we are always interested in doing that. So, there is always division out there in ADM exploring and extending a little bit our franchises and our engagement. So, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see experiments or tests here and there. And we do that a lot. We do that in products at our B2C. We do that in products that are biologicals. We do that in products related to the farmer. And we continue to expand. These are things that, over the years, they turn out into big businesses. At one point in time, we started with destination market and now it\u2019s a big part of our franchise. At one point in time, we started with BioSolutions and now we are making more $0.25 billion of EBITDA on that. At one point in time, we started with the differentiated grain that now we call regen Ag, and now we are in the million acres of that. So, I think it\u2019s just the innovation part of ADM, and you are going to see green shoots at that. I am glad you are paying attention to that. And we are going to see expansion of those things into the future. So, thank you.\nMegan Britt: So, with that, I think that was the last question for the call today. I would like to thank you for joining us. Please feel free to following up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan. This morning, we reported very strong fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.93. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. Our full year adjusted EPS of $7.85, adjusted segment operating profit of $6.6 billion, and trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC of 13.6% demonstrate once again the great work of our global team of dedicated colleagues who manage unprecedented market disruptions to deliver an outstanding year. Our full year operating cash flow before working capital was $5.3 billion. This strong cash flow and the disciplined management of our balance sheet allow us to continue to reinvest in our business, with $1.3 billion in capital expenditures and return cash to shareholders. In total, we returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases in 2022. Next slide, please. With the expectation of continued strong cash flow, today, we are announcing a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share. We are proud of our record of 91 years of uninterrupted dividends and 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. And I'd like to thank our shareholders for their continued support of ADM. Next slide, please. When I examine 2022, our ability to drive structural growth in earnings and improvement in ROIC was supported by key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise, particularly the progress we made on our productivity and innovation objectives. Our productivity work in 2022 included enhancing our operational resilience, including through stabilizing our plant operations and streamlining our operating systems. In order to meet growing customer demand and drive efficiencies, we delivered multiple projects to enhance our operational footprint, from modernization to improving and scheduled downtime to capacity expansions. We completed our Marshall, Minnesota modernization, opened a new mill house in Clinton, completed our Quincy refinery expansion and improved output and yields at our Rondonopolis diesel plant in Brazil. We also continued to optimize our North American milling footprint. As you know, we also introduced a new $1 billion challenge in 2022. There is no clearer demonstration of how our colleagues and culture are driving returns than the fact that thousands of ADM team members from around the globe took the initiative, step up and identified opportunities that unlocked more than $1.6 billion in cash in 2022. On innovation, our accomplishments include a focus on capturing the benefits of organic growth investments and M&A as we continue to get closer to our customers and extend our capabilities to meet growing global demand for our products. Our Nutrition business continued to outpace the industry, with 18% constant currency revenue growth for the full year. We delivered an impressive 26% in year-over-year revenue growth in BioSolutions. The portfolio of acquisitions we made in the prior year continued to deliver OP above our financial projections and we advanced targeted production capacity expansions to meet growing customer demand. We announced expansions of our alternative protein capabilities in Decatur, Illinois, and starch production in Marshall, Minnesota. We completed our alternative protein expansion in Serbia and are able to launch our expanded probiotic capacity in Valencia, Spain. And we continue to expect our joint venture crush and refining facility in North Dakota to be operational by this year's harvest. Slide 6 please. Now let's look ahead. We have a robust plan for driving enduring value creation in 2023 and beyond. In productivity, our work has a common theme, changing the way we work by standardizing, digitizing and automating our manufacturing plants and our offices alike. I previously mentioned our successful Marshall modernization. That was the blueprint for our wider work to unlock value across our production footprint through enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics. We have now approved the scope for the first 2 years of the program, encompassing 18 manufacturing facilities. We continue to expect double-digit returns from this important initiative. And we are continuing to advance 1ADM, which is enabling us to improve our processes and expand capabilities across the value chain. 2022 was an important year for our 1ADM business transformation. We completed several rollouts and we are seeing benefits in areas ranging from indirect procurement to go-to-market strategies to grain merchandising. In 2023, we will continue to expand the breadth and scope of this work, which is empowering our businesses to deliver profitable revenue growth and higher margins. Next, we are focused on maintaining our structural growth momentum via our innovation work. As you might recall, we have spoken in the past about our strategic growth platforms: sustainability, differentiated grain, alternative proteins, BioSolutions, microbial solutions and microbiome modification. These growth opportunities go through a natural evolution. When new, we launch them at the corporate level. As they mature, they become more embedded in our businesses. Differentiated grain is now firm part of our Ag Services and Oilseeds segments everyday work. BioSolutions is growing within carbohydrate solutions. Alternative proteins and microbiome are pillars of nutrition. With these efforts maturing in the businesses, we are able to focus on other opportunities. One of the most important is decarbonization, which is a critical component of our sustainability growth platform and is driving the evolution of our carbohydrate solutions business. Our goal is to reduce the carbon intensity of our assets and value chain in order to be the preferred partner in low-carbon intensity feedstocks for a growing demand base. We have made several announcements to mark milestones towards this goal in recent years, including our regenerative agriculture efforts, which enrolled 1 million unique acres over the past year; our Strive 35 goals; our initiatives to connect and expand our carbon capture and storage capabilities; and our heat and energy project indicator. We are looking at multiple other pathways to reducing our carbon intensity, like more sustainable energy sources for our facilities. And our efforts aren't just in the U.S. We have plans for other regions as well, including some EMEA projects we hope to speak about in the future. All of these projects contribute to our ability to offer low carbon intensity feedstocks and that is allowing us to continue to advance our work to transition our dry mills to produce sustainable aviation fuel; help scale up the scaled food products with new sustainable attributes, like the ingredients we will sell to Pepsi from the regenerative agriculture agreement we announced last year, and propelled the expansion of BioSolutions with joint ventures like with LG Chem. And even as we advance our decarbonization plan, we are always looking at new ways to help solve our world's challenges for food security, health and well-being and sustainability. For example, we are continuing to explore opportunities around precision fermentation, which we used to call microbial solutions, in which microbes rapidly grown in fermenters fed by dextrose, transform the sugars into a wide variety of products for food, feed and fiber. That's a longer term horizon for ADM, but it gives us a hint of the kind of opportunities we see in the years ahead. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram? Thank you, Vikram. Next slide, please. 2022 was a truly outstanding year for ADM. As we look forward to 2023, we expect another very strong year. There are a number of market factors that we see as relevant for shipping our performance. We still see tightness in supply and demand balances in key products and regions. We see strong demand for vegetable oil, driven largely but robust demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel. Resilient food demand should drive higher volumes and margins in starches, sweeteners and wheat milling. We see continued strong demand for ethanol, including positive discretionary blending economics. And as Vikram mentioned, we expect 10% plus constant currency OP growth from Nutrition. We have a strong playbook powered by our deep expertise and our unparalleled footprint and capabilities to manage a dynamic market environment. Our healthy balance sheet provides ongoing optionality as we continue to pull the levers under our control to deliver results. And we expect positive contributions from productivity and innovation initiatives across the company that will help us drive value in 2023. Taken together, we expect to deliver another very strong year in 2023. With that, Bailey, please open the line for questions. Good morning, Ben. Yes. Thank you, Ben. Listen, that business has been a very successful story at the customer level for many, many years. We continue to drive higher growth rates than the industry we participate in. So that has not changed, the robust pipeline growth there, and we have achieved all that then through a very disciplined strategy of bolt-on acquisitions and organic growth. So we did 4 bolt-ons in 2021. We took the time in 2022 to integrate them and digest them. At the same time, in 2022, we started many projects that I highlighted in my initial comments on organic growth. So I would say that will be the pattern that you should expect to us. I mean we have stated many years in our balanced capital allocation, and in this nutrition pace, if you will, of bolt-on and M&A and taking some time to digest some of those things. Very pleased to report that the four acquisitions we made in 2021 are executing or delivering ahead of their business model. So we're not planning to change the pace or the strategy that we have had so far. The projects that we are making selective expansions on or bringing to life soon are all going well even despite the long time \u2013 long lead time equipment and sometimes you face in the industry. We've done that in anticipation of all that. So we feel very good about being able to support, with capacity, the growth in demand that we see in the marketplace from our participations. Go ahead, Ben. Good morning, Adam. Yes. Thank you, Adam. I think you captured the situation well. I think we continue to see a very strong margin environment in Ag Services and Oilseeds. 2022, we hit in all cylinders. I think that every piece of our business hit records. When we look at the 2023, we continue to see very strong demand. If you look at North America, North America had a strong meal demand and certainly very strong domestic demand for oil, driven by all the factors, driven by sustainability that you know. We see a strong potential for crush margins in Europe, given the bad crop in Argentina and the fact that Europe will continue to export biodiesel to the U.S. given the need that we have here. So all in all, we continue to see strength. Certainly, RPO, we're going to see the strong demand. Biodiesel and all that is going \u2013 we're seeing strong margins and very good volumes for next year. We do have visibility into this \u2013 into the next year, given our book, so we feel good about that business. As Vikram mentioned in the commentary may be Ag Services that we're planning it a little bit slower than last year, given the exceptional results that we had last year. And \u2013 but as difficult as it is to pinpoint a number, Adam, given that we have China uncertainty, war that has been going on for a year and, certainly, weather events, that we still need to build the U.S. crop, and we still need to finish the Latin American crops. I would say we favor more range scenarios. And in the range of scenarios, 2023, falls into a very strong range for us. So I don't know \u2013 I will not venture to pinpoint a specific number, but certainly strong range. When you go to Carb Solutions, when we talk to our customers, demand for the products is stable. We've been able to have strong margins in all that, whether it's sweeteners and starches or whether it's wheat milling. When we look at BioSolutions, it continues to grow, like 26% of revenue. And then we see EBITDA margins in the 20% for that business, which is a very profitable business that is growing their contribution into Carb Solutions as part of the total UP. So that is a business that Vikram called the question mark of \u2013 the more volatile part of it probably is ethanol. And that's \u2013 right now, like a little bit like in the last year, we start with this time of the year with low margins. And \u2013 but we think that we're going to have very good incentive for people to blend ethanol, the numbers are there. RINs balances are tight, will encourage people to blend. So I think that given the prices that they have, I think that expecting export in the range of 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion gallons per year is reasonable. And you saw these days, Petrobras in Brazil, increasing the gasoline prices by 7%, so they are going to be less flow from there to here in all these. So we're still planning for a little bit softer, maybe Carb Solutions in light of our ethanol forecast. But conditions are \u2013 could change in ethanol and it could make it a close year. So all in all, we continue to see a very strong year for 2023. Hi, Ben. Yes. Thank you, Vikram. Ben, listen, I think we have been \u2013 you have been witnessing how we built this nutrition business over the years. This is a business that, if I take over the last 3 years, it has been growing OP by 20%, CAGR if you will. So, it's a business that we continue to add layers of capabilities so we can continue to win at the customer front, whether it is we go from individual ingredients to systems, where we bring functionality to those systems through bioactives, whether we bring sustainability benefits to that through our decarbonization or regen Ag. So, we continue to add layers to continue to help customers excel at the consumer level. And we see that in our win rates, and we see that in our pipeline. So, we have visibility into that. As Vikram said, maybe some of the categories soften a little bit, but our ability to gain share, to win faster than those categories, has been demonstrated. I think this year, we grew revenue significantly higher than the market. So, when we look forward, as I said in my \u2013 I think one of the earlier answers, we continue to expect bolt-on and M&A \u2013 bolt-on M&A and organic growth. We had four companies in 2021. We are building capabilities and new capacity in 2022 that we are going to see on the stream in \u201823, and we are going to continue to grow that. So, we haven't deviated from our 2025 plan. And I don't think it will require massive M&A to achieve there. It will \u2013 you will see this steady state. But this is a business that we are building in the middle of a lot of volatility in the market. This is of course, versus the legacy ADM business, it's more complex in the number of SKUs that we have, in the number of customers that we have, in the number of plants and categories that we manage. So, when supply chain issues happen or market volatility happen, it's a little bit more complex to fix in this business. And that's why we expect a first half that's going to be a little bit subdued when you add the demand fulfillment issues and some of the capability building, with the fact that also lysine is coming down, if you will, in prices, at least for the moment. So, I would say nothing that deviated. Certainly, if you ask me personally, and I think the management team, are we happy with Q4, I mean of course, Q4 underperformed our own expectations. I mean that's nothing new for a business that, again, has been growing 20% per year CAGR. And \u2013 but we think that this is just a trajectory in the business that continued to win faster than what the market gives us at this point in time. We don't expect a deviation to our long-term plan at this point. Thank you, Manav. Thank you for the question. We continued to see very strong demand across the world, not only for all the oils. I think that if you take the four oils, demand is running harder than production, if you will, globally. So, even I would say before renewable green diesel happened, we had already a tight balance sheet from an oils perspective, and that has continued. When you think about the capacity that renewable green diesel is installing, it's going to have a huge pull in soybean oil. And we have found that there is \u2013 we have found relatively easy to place the mill in the export markets. And if you look at the market overall, the meal market is a market of like 175 million metric tons and growing. So, if you calculate by 2026, we need to have 20 million tons more soybean meal, just to catch up with the demand. And if you look at everything that we are building through the RGD and the capacity expansions, we are estimating about 15 million tons of supply on soybean meal. So, it's still we have \u2013 we are still covered in only 75% of the expected soybean meal demand out there. So, we are looking at this as you can understand very carefully. Remember, as I always mentioned, it took us 2 years to assess Spiritwood and start building it. I am happy to report that is going to come online for the harvest. So, I would say we look at this, but the demand on both sides on the soybean meal and soybean oil clearly can support all this capacity. So, we continued to see an environment in which crush margins will be strong and highly supportive for many, many years. Yes. Thank you. Good questions. So, on the short-term part of the question, we see China will continue to increase imports. If you look at domestic grain prices are at historically high levels, especially now that we are \u2013 that they are reopening. Of course, a reopening of China could be a game changer for a variety of commodities, not just grains. We look at domestic vegetable oil stocks have been at relatively low levels. And we have seen, during the second half of 2022, an increase in domestic pork prices since, I would say, last spring. So, that prompted farmers to increase their herd. So, we see that demand in the short-term. But again, I think the variability here may be on the upside on how much of the reopening is bringing people to consumption. Of course, people have been in lockdown almost for 2 years in China. And there is a \u2013 you are going to find the same pent-up demand that we saw ourselves maybe since last year when everybody came out of COVID. So, I think at this point in time, short-term, China will be probably a positive upside, if anything, to our forecast. When you look at the long-term and the demographics of China that you described, probably about 50% of the Chinese population is middle class or what you will consider middle class, and they are in this process of increasing their protein consumption. But still historically, if you look at what the U.S., we consume about 270 pounds per year of proteins. China is at the 170 pounds per year level. So, they are still far from our level of consumption. And again, if you look at our lifestyles are converging slowly. So, you will expect their protein per capita consumption to grow significantly during this period. The other thing you need to remember is that we are still going to be 10 billion people in the planet by 2050, which is one of the issues that serves our \u2013 or drives our purpose, which is trying to increase the carrying capacity of the planet, trying to feed all that. And whether it's in China or whether it's in Africa or whether it's in Southeast Asia, we are a global company, we have a global footprint, and you have seen us continue to expand our destination marketing footprint to serve customers around the world. So, we will serve \u2013 we will serve the feeding of growing population of the world, whether it's in China or somewhere else. But as I said, I don't expect China to have a decline in the next probably two decades in terms of their demand for protein consumption. Yes. Rob, I couldn't hear you very well, but I get the gist of the question. So, listen, I think at this point in time \u2013 and as I said before, we have visibility for probably the first quarter and big part of the first half, 2023 will be another strong year for crush, certainly above the long-term guidance that we provided at our global Investor Day. We also are planning to have an improvement in our process volumes that given some of the operational resilience initiatives. And we are going to have Spiritwood online in Q4. And hopefully, by in a couple of \u2013 maybe in a couple of weeks and a month, we will resume crush in Paraguay. We continue to have good crush margins in Europe. Certainly, Europe will be helped by the small crop in Argentina. Also, I think energy prices have moderated a little bit in Europe given the warm summer. So, we are also shifting in Europe as much to soybean crush as we can as there is margin there. We are also going to have this year that we didn't have last year, better canola margins. Canola crush margins certainly and now that we have a Canadian crop, are more in the $120 to $140 per ton in North America, maybe $70 to $75 in Europe. So, I would say, we are having good crush rates. We are having good mill export demand in the U.S. We are having very strong soybean oil demand here in the U.S. So, I will say, in general, we don't see any clouds in the horizon for crush. The crush business will have a very strong year in 2023. As I have said before, Rob, I wouldn't pinpoint a specific number given the China reopening, given the issues in Ukraine that whether it's not driving crush margins that may drive energy prices. And certainly, the crops, we are expecting that Brazil needs to have a big crop that will offset the decline in Argentina. And we hope that the U.S. will have a big crop as well, but we still need to go through the weather in both instances. So, again, I will just reiterate a very strong environment for crush as far as we can see. Thank you. Yes. I think you called it well. I think that when we had the low water levels in the Q4 that hurt us, of course, we lost some bean business. But the corn business basically is going to be with us until the crop in Brazil \u2013 the harvest in Brazil comes, so it's like middle of the year. So, we see that as a very strong business in Ag services for North America. We also have, unfortunately, I think Ukraine Grain Association has come up with a statement that they don't believe corn for \u201823 will exceed 18 million tons, which is a far cry from the 29 million tons or 30 million tons that they used to produce or we expected. So, demand continues to be solid out there. And we still \u2013 as a world, we need Brazil to have a good crop. Of course, if there are rains and delay a little bit the harvest of soybeans, that may delay a little bit the planting of the next crop. But we hope that in your farm and everybody's farm, corn is growing strongly because we need it. And again, the U.S. will be exporting a lot of that from here until probably July. Yes. Thank you for the question. Listen, I think that we continued to enlarge our relationships with customers, but also with farmers. And as we continue to increase our digital engagement with them, we also increased the bartering and exchange of many, many products. And we have a good relationship with farmers. We have the trust of the farmers, and so every now and then, they bring challenges to us. And I think the challenges of biologicals, if you will, given that we have some work in precision fermentation and things like that is, we are always interested in doing that. So, there is always division out there in ADM exploring and extending a little bit our franchises and our engagement. So, I wouldn't be surprised to see experiments or tests here and there. And we do that a lot. We do that in products at our B2C. We do that in products that are biologicals. We do that in products related to the farmer. And we continue to expand. These are things that, over the years, they turn out into big businesses. At one point in time, we started with destination market and now it's a big part of our franchise. At one point in time, we started with BioSolutions and now we are making more $0.25 billion of EBITDA on that. At one point in time, we started with the differentiated grain that now we call regen Ag, and now we are in the million acres of that. So, I think it's just the innovation part of ADM, and you are going to see green shoots at that. I am glad you are paying attention to that. And we are going to see expansion of those things into the future. So, thank you."

            "name": "Vikram Luthar",
            "content": "Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 7. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year with substantially higher year-over-year results in Q4. Ag Services results were higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Low water conditions reduced North American export volumes, partially offset by the South American team, which executed well to deliver higher margins and volumes. Global trade results were lower than the strong fourth quarter of 2021 with lower ocean freight results partially offset by higher results in EMEA origination and destination marketing. The business benefited from a $110 million legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Reserve Louisiana Export facility. Crushing results were more than double those of the prior year period. In North America, strong export volumes for soybean meal and growing domestic demand for renewable diesel contributed to strong margins. In EMEA, oil demand powered strong rapeseed margins more than offsetting higher energy costs compared to the prior year. Expanding margins drove negative timing impacts in the quarter of approximately $40 million. RPO results were significantly higher year-over-year as the business continued to execute well to meet demand for food oil, renewable diesel in the U.S. and biodiesel globally. Equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Looking ahead, we expect AS&O results for Q1 to remain strong, similar to last year's very strong quarter led by continued strength in crush margins and RPO. Ag Services is likely to be lower year-over-year, particularly in light of very strong global trade results in the prior year quarter. Slide 8, please. Carbohydrate Solutions had a strong 2022, with full year results higher than 2021. For the quarter, results were substantially lower than the fourth quarter of 2021 due to pressured industry ethanol margins. The starches and sweeteners sub-segment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much higher year-over-year results. The North America business delivered solid volumes and strong margins in both starches and sweeteners, partially offsetting lower ethanol margins. The EMEA team effectively managed risk and delivered improved results on better margins in a continued dynamic environment. The global wheat milling business delivered higher margins driven by solid customer demand. Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially lower as higher ethanol inventory levels pressured margins especially compared to the very strong margin environment in the fourth quarter of 2021. Looking at the first quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions, we expect continued solid demand and strong margins for starches, sweeteners and wheat flour. Ethanol margins are currently pressured due to high industry inventory levels. If industry stocks come back down, results for the quarter could be similar to Q1 of 2022. If margins remain pressured, results would likely be lower. On Slide 9, the Nutrition business continued its strong growth trajectory in 2022. ADM demonstrated that it remains the provider of choice in Nutrition for systems as our growing pipeline and continued strong win rates delivered full year revenue growth of 18% on a constant currency basis. The business continued to outperform industry growth levels and delivered 11% higher profits for the full year on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, revenues grew 11% on a constant currency basis. Q4 operating profits were significantly lower than the prior year quarters. Human Nutrition results were lower than those of the fourth quarter of 2021. Flavors results were similar to the prior year as strong revenue growth helped offset demand fulfillment challenges. Specialty Ingredients continued to see strong demand for its product portfolio, including plant-based proteins, offset by inventory adjustments. Health & Wellness was higher year-over-year, driven primarily by the bioactives portfolio, including the results from the Deerland acquisition. Animal results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the lower margins in amino acids, driven by recovery in the global supply of lysine. Pet Nutrition volumes were lower in Latin America, partially driven by demand fulfillment challenges. Feed results were stronger driven by APAC and Latin America partially offset by the impact of softer demand in EMEA. As we look ahead, we expect overall Nutrition results in Q1 to be lower than the prior year's record first quarter, with Human Nutrition delivering similar year-over-year results on strong flavors and SI growth and lower Animal Nutrition results primarily due to weaker margins in amino acids. I want to take a moment to expand on our view of Nutrition in 2023. Nutrition is expected to continue on a positive growth trajectory for full year 2023, including 10% plus profit growth and a similar level of revenue growth. The growth is likely to be led by Human Nutrition and to be weighted in the back half of the year as the first half will see headwinds in Animal Nutrition due to the continued impacts of weaker margins in amino acids and because we will see increasing recovery in demand fulfillment as we move through the year. Slide 10, please. Other business results for Q4 was significantly higher than the prior year's fourth quarter. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM investor services, and captive insurance experienced favorable underwriting results and lower claim settlements versus the prior year. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $299 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence related to growth initiatives. Other corporate was favorable versus the prior year primarily due to higher contributions from foreign currency-related hedge activity and lower railroad maintenance expense. Corporate results also included losses related to the mark-to-market adjustment on the Wilmar exchangeable bond and severance totaling $6 million. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher interest rates. We expect corporate cost for 2023 to be around $1.5 billion, driven primarily by inflation and higher interest expense. Other business performance should be higher than 2022, offsetting a significant portion of the increased corporate costs as higher interest rates positively impact our ADM IS business. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was approximately 16% compared to 21% in the prior year. The decreased rate was driven primarily by changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings in addition to lower discrete tax expense versus the prior year. Our full year adjusted tax rate was 17%. For 2023, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. Year-to-date operating cash flows before working capital of $5.3 billion are up significantly versus $3.9 billion over the same period last year. Our net debt to total capital ratio is about 25%, and we continue to have ample available liquidity. Our strong cash flows and balance sheet have enabled continued investment in the business, with $1.3 billion in capital expenditures for the full year. We currently plan to maintain capital expenditures at about $1.3 billion in 2023 and continue to have significant financial capacity to pursue strategic growth objectives. We have been continuing to return capital to shareholders. We distributed $900 million in dividends and repurchased almost $1.5 billion of shares in 2022. We are planning $1 billion in opportunistic buybacks for 2023, subject to other strategic uses of capital. Juan? Yes. So effectively, Ben, we don't assume a lot of change in currency for 2023. Yes, you've seen some weakness in the U.S. dollar, but you can assume that, even on a reported basis right now, we assume similar growth rates in OP. So based on the customer contracting we've seen in the Sweeteners and Starches portfolio, Ben, we do see strong volumes and margins. And with the improved mix, we talked about BioSolutions expansion, we actually have 26% year-on-year growth, and BioSolution margin remained very robust. And with the improved mix we actually see a potential, in the Sweeteners and Starches business, to have higher volumes and margins in 2023. Clearly, ethanol remains uncertain and we've seen recently inventory levels remain high, and that's actually pretty similar to January of last year as well. But we're still constructive in terms of outlook for ethanol, given what's happening with the RVO framework, the fact that gasoline demand is expected to be roughly flat versus 2022, blending economics remain very favorable. And frankly, export volume should be similar to last year, around 1.4 billion gallons. So that's a quick snapshot of our outlook for 2023. Good morning. Yes, Ben, in terms of Q4, the issues that affected Q4, I'd say, are kind of a little more temporary, right, that we think we will be able to work through over the course of 2023, as I talked about. Specifically, what's important for you to know that the demand is very, very strong, right? So that is \u2013 we talked about the strongest-ever pipeline in the Human Nutrition business and very strong win rates. So across every category that we play in, almost we've got strong demand. Yes, there is some softening in certain parts of the business, right? We are aware of dietary supplements that being a little softer. Plant-based protein growth may moderate a bit from the pace we've seen historically. But nevertheless, our growth has been very strong in Human Nutrition. The challenge we've had is the demand fulfillment. That's going to take us a while to address and overcome. Animal Nutrition, on the other hand, we benefited from strong margins in lysine, but in Q4, the compression in margins were sharper and faster than we expected, and that's going to continue over the course of 2023. So we've got to offset that plus drive growth, and that's what gives us a slightly below trend line growth for 2023 around 10% plus. Having said that, the outlook remains robust. And maybe, Juan, do you want to talk about the 2025 perspective?"

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\nMegan Britt: Thank you, Alex. Good morning, and welcome to ADM\u2019s third quarter earnings webcast. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today\u2019s webcast will be available at adm.com. Please turn to slide 2, the Company\u2019s safe harbor statement, which says that some of our comments and materials constitute forward-looking statement that reflects management\u2019s current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. On today\u2019s webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will provide an overview of the quarter and how we\u2019re continuing to advance our strategy. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar, will review the drivers of our performance as well as corporate results and financial highlights. Then Juan will make some final comments, and he and Vikram will take your questions. Please turn to slide 3. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Megan. This morning, we reported a strong third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.6 billion. Our trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA approached $6.6 billion, and our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13%. Throughout the quarter, our 40,000 colleagues around the globe continued to deliver on our purpose by supporting the global food system and providing needed nutrition to billions. Global demand for our products remained robust, and our ability to meet customer needs demonstrated our team\u2019s expertise in managing dynamic market conditions as well as the unique benefits of our integrated global value chain and product portfolio. We continue to generate strong cash flows, which support the continued advancement of our strategy, including investments in new capabilities and growth engines across our three businesses and the return of capital to our shareholders. Next slide, please. Even as the team demonstrated superb day-to-day execution in the third quarter, we continued to make great progress on driving our strategic growth priorities. In each of our business segments, we\u2019ve created and are continuing to build new growth engines that are aligned with enduring global trends. As demand for more sustainable produced low carbon intensity products continues to drive growth across our portfolio, our AS&O team signed a groundbreaking long-term strategic agreement with PepsiCo to enroll up to 2 million regenerative agricultural acres over the next 7.5 years. I\u2019ll be talking more about our regen ag efforts in a moment. Sustainability from demand for sustainable package into the ongoing energy transformation supported by policies like the inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. is also driving the evolution of our Carbohydrate Solutions business. In the third quarter, for example, we formally signed two joint ventures with LG Chem for U.S. production of lactic acid and polylactic acid for a variety of applications, including bioplastics. Both sustainability and food security are powering our growth in nutrition, including our continued investment in alternative proteins. In Q3, we advanced several alternative protein enhancements and expansions, including an agreement with Benson Hill for the exclusive rights to process and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary ingredients derived from their ultra-high protein soybeans. Each of these investments is aligned with global trends and each demonstrates how we are advancing new avenues of growth across all three of our business segments. Slide 5, please. Our strategic work remains focused on two pillars: productivity and innovation. As we discussed at our Global Investor Day last December, we are targeting $1.1 billion in benefits from our productivity efforts, which improve our long-term returns profile while helping us mitigate the impact of market forces, including inflation. Strong returns means focusing on both, the numerator and the denominator. That is why around the globe, our team is continuing to identify opportunities to monetize assets and optimize working capital as part of our $1 billion challenge. As of last week, we had realized cash generation in excess of $1 billion from this initiative. On the numerator side, we\u2019re investing in new technologies to enhance our efficiencies. Last quarter, I highlighted the operational transformation of our core facility in Marshall, Minnesota, and discussed how we hope to emulate that success more widely across our production footprint. We are now advancing an ambitious plan to install enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics and more than 50 production facilities globally with further expansion possible as we evaluate and size the opportunities. These investments will enable us to unlock capacity, improve reliability and enhance safety. We are currently evaluating partners to support us in this important work, which we intend to execute in a phased approach, focusing on 8 to 10 facilities per year. We anticipate investing more than $1 billion over this period, and we expect double-digit returns on this investment as we are seeing in Marshall. We\u2019ll be updating you on our progress towards these goals and other productivity efforts on upcoming calls. Next slide, please. Turning to innovation. Sustainability is driving force both of our purpose and our growth strategy. And one great example is the scaling up of our regenerative agricultural efforts. regen ag practices include cover cropping, improved nutrient management and conservation tillage. The environmental and climate benefits associated with regen ag can include greenhouse gas emissions reductions, increased soil carbon sequestration, water quality improvements and biodiversity promotion. With global scale and a value chain that reaches from 220,000 farmers to customers ranging from multinational CPGs to start-ups, ADM has a unique opportunity to lead in this area. I already mentioned our strategic partnership with PepsiCo, which we believe is truly groundbreaking in its scope and long-term vision. We\u2019re working with other partners as well. For example, in the spring, we announced an agreement with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation that includes a commitment of $20 million to sign up more regen ag acres. And we\u2019re partnering with Farmers Business Network to make their gradable farm management platform available as a regen ag technology enabler for our North American farmer base. We\u2019ve signed about 750,000 unique regen ag acres in the U.S. so far this year. We expect this number to grow with every passing year. These programs are getting us closer to farmers and closer to our customers. And we anticipate that within the next five years, our annual operating profit impact from this work will reach more than $100 million, while continuing to help lead our industry to a more responsible, sustainable future. While we are on the subject of sustainability, I\u2019m very proud that some of the good work we\u2019ve done in this arena is being recognized. Just yesterday, ADM was included on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily annual list of 100 Best ESG Companies. And in July, Environment and Energy Leader magazine recognized our Illinois-based indicator carbon capture and storage partnership as a top project for energy and environmental management. We posted a new update on our website that details our progress in advancing our Strive 35 goals, including our commitment to reduce our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2035. And because Strive 35 isn\u2019t the end of our sustainability journey, that update includes our aspiration to work towards net zero emissions by 2050. We\u2019ll have more to say about this as we continue to evaluate and develop our path forward. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?\nVikram Luthar: Thanks, Juan. Slide 7, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered substantially higher year-over-year results. Ag Services results were significantly higher than the third quarter of 2021. The short crops in South America supported U.S. exports, driving improved volumes and margins in North American origination, which had significant negative impacts from Hurricane Ida in the prior year. Better margins in global ocean freight, driven by good execution amid dynamic global trade flows, powered better results in global trade. South American origination saw improved volumes and margins driven by increased farmer selling in addition to higher volumes through our export facilities. Crushing results were significantly higher with margins driven by resilient global demand for both meal and oil. Strong rapeseed margins in EMEA, driven by robust oil demand and continued market dislocations along with positive impacts from an insurance settlement helped drive improved results. North American soy crush margins continued to benefit from renewable diesel demand. Also, net positive timing effects in the quarter were about $175 million as compared to the approximately $70 million in the prior year quarter. Positive results were partially offset by lower crush volumes, including impacts from idle facilities in Ukraine and Paraguay. Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year in a strong margin environment for both refined oil and biodiesel. Robust performance in global refined oils was driven by healthy demand and elevated refined oil margins amid supply chain disruptions. Equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher versus the third quarter of 2021. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect AS&O to deliver much better results in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect continued strength in crush margins to more than offset the adverse impact of low water conditions on U.S. export volumes. Slide 8, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team delivered significantly higher results versus the prior year quarter. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much improved year-over-year results amid steady global demand for sweeteners and starches. Corn co-products, including continued robust demand for corn oil as well as effective risk management drove higher execution margins in North America. Wheat milling had a strong performance, delivering improved volumes and margins to meet healthy demand for flower. In EMEA, the business delivered solid volumes and margins and managed through a dynamic energy environment to drive stronger results. Our BioSolutions platform continued its upward trajectory with 29% year-over-year revenue growth year-to-date. Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially lower. Ethanol margins were pressured by higher industry inventories, lower domestic demand and elevated corn costs. In addition, the prior year\u2019s results included contributions from the now sold Peoria facility. Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter of this year for Carbohydrate Solutions to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Demand and margins for sweeteners, starches and flower should remain healthy, but ethanol margins are expected to be substantially lower than last year\u2019s historic highs. On slide 9, the Nutrition business continued to outpace the industry with Q3 revenue growth of 10% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter adjusted operating profit was similar to last year and 7% higher on a constant currency basis. Profit was impacted in the quarter by the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar and demand fulfillment challenges as the rapid growth in customer demand exceeded our operational capacity. We are prioritizing unlocking capacity in the face of some persistent supply chain bottlenecks. Our year-to-date performance remains very strong, including 20% revenue and 19% OP growth on a constant currency basis. And our portfolio of acquisitions from 2021 continues to deliver OP above our acquisition models. In this quarter, Human Nutrition results were higher than the third quarter of 2021. We strong demand for plant-based proteins as well as solid performance in texturants drove continued growth in specialty ingredients. Flavors results were impacted by adverse currency translation effects in EMEA, partially offset by continued strong demand growth in the region. Demand fulfillment challenges in North America and lower demand in APAC, driven partly by the lockdowns in China also negatively impacted results. Health and Wellness was lower versus the prior year, which included higher income from the fiber fermentation agreement. Animal Nutrition results were down versus the prior year quarter. Pet results were lower in Latin America on lower volumes, partially offset by strong volumes and margins in North America. Softer animal protein demand affected feed volumes. Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter for Nutrition this year to be higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 with continued strong demand in human nutrition more than offsetting adverse currency effects. We expect Nutrition\u2019s full year OP growth to be between 15% and 20% on a constant currency basis. Slide 10, please. Other business results increased from the prior year quarter. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services, partially offset by increased claim settlements in captive insurance. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $251 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to performance-related compensation accruals, higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the Company\u2019s centers of excellence. Other Corporate was favorable versus the prior year, primarily due to higher results from foreign currency-related hedge activity. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher interest rates. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately 16%. We still project full year corporate costs to be about $1.3 billion, and we still expect our adjusted tax rate to remain in the range of 16% to 19%. Next slide, please. Year-to-date, operating cash flows, before working capital of $4.7 billion, are up significantly versus $3.1 billion over the same period last year. Our net debt to total capital ratio is about 24%, and we have available liquidity of about $11.2 billion. We are continuing to invest in the business with $841 million in capital expenditures and have returned capital to shareholders with $677 million in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter, which reflects the completion of the $1 billion stock buyback announced last quarter. And with enhanced financial flexibility and in line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of shares by the end of 2023, subject to other strategic uses of capital. Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vikram. Slide 12, please. So to recap, our team delivered another outstanding quarter. And thanks to our execution and the advancement of our strategy, we are well positioned to end 2022 strong. Last quarter, we said we were expecting full year earnings higher than $6.50 per share. Based on where we are today, we now clearly expect to exceed $7 per share. Looking ahead, there are several externalities that we are monitoring going into 2023. We anticipate ongoing resilient demand for our products, a strong crush margin environment, a positive outlook for starches and sweeteners, and a continuation of our growth trajectory in Nutrition. There is also significant uncertainty in the global economy and geopolitical environment. We expect to carry our strong momentum into the first quarter of 2022. And beyond that, we are confident that our scenario planning and execution will give us the ability to effectively manage through a dynamic environment. We\u2019re also going to continue to benefit from our strategic work, and we\u2019ll continue to deliver on those priorities throughout 2023. We\u2019ll advance productivity initiatives to improve operations and processes, optimize costs and enhance efficiencies. We\u2019ll drive innovation, expanding and creating new growth engines across our entire business portfolio, Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition. And we\u2019ll advance those strategic objectives as we always have, alongside our team\u2019s exceptional day-to-day execution, delivering for our colleagues, consumers, customers and stakeholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to ask about your process volumes in the quarter. You cited lower crush volume utilization in Ukraine as well as Paraguay. Could you talk a little bit about what you expect your go-forward process volumes to look like? And is the lion\u2019s share of the decline in oilseeds processed year-over-year, that 10% decline, is that from those two regions? Were there any other contributing factors?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Ben. Yes, as you noted, we had lower volumes, and part of that were coming from Europe in soil and rape. We had some adverse weather and some logistical constraints in Europe in terms of navigation, some of the rivers. We also have a reduction in South America, in soy crush because of Paraguay shutdown, mostly because of lack of beans. We had also some reductions in North America due to canola seed availability. And certainly, we have our Ukraine sun crush facility down, as you know, since last March. So, we have 850 facilities around the world, as you know. And we deal with logistics, with adverse weather with manpower issues like every company out there. So, that what was the decline in volumes at this point in time. As some of those one-off issues subside, I mean, we will see those volumes coming back to normal rates.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\nBen Theurer: Juan, Vikram, congrats on the results. I wanted to follow up on Nutrition. As you\u2019ve talked about some of the logistics bottlenecks that you plan to overcome, could you elaborate a little more in detail those issues are and what you may have to do in terms of investments to get this right. And then also aligned with that, what is actually your kind of FX assumption because you stretched the constant currency terms commentary on the outlook for the fourth quarter. So, just to understand a little bit the regional breakdown as well and what FX headwinds we should expect into the short-term period, just given the euro weakness. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Ben. Listen, as Vikram mentioned in his commentary, we are exceptionally proud of how the team is generating demand, how our value proposition in Nutrition continues to resonate and attract customers. Our pipeline has never been bigger and our growth rates continue to be -- our winning rates continue to be off the chart. So, the problem with that is that it catches up with your production pretty quickly. And although we have plans to expand those, some of the supply chain issues in delivery equipment and all that, sometimes don\u2019t play exactly in our favor. When you look at where specifically those issues have impacted us the most, it has been in flavors, I would say, and mostly in North America, but some of that in Europe. On the other hand, the facility that we inaugurated last year, Pinghu in China has suffered from lack of volumes because of the lockdowns due to COVID restrictions in China. So, I would say, we had a little bit upset in the sense that we couldn\u2019t bring all that demand that we have generated into the P&L. And certainly, those things are, to a certain degree, now under control. And as you can imagine, everybody in the Company is driving very hard to bring extra capacity. As you know, on the last quarter or a couple of quarters ago, we bought FISA precisely to alleviate a little bit that. Of course, we\u2019re using contract manufacturing. So, we are pulling everything. But in a very tight environment with also some shifting of demand based on consumer demand, customers are shifting some of that demand, our ability to react promptly to that given the high growth rates caught up with us in the quarter. There is a lot of capacity coming for next year. So first of all, all this is an upside for next year. Hopefully, we\u2019re going to be able to fulfill all that demand next year. But there is also expansions. If you think about -- we have a new line in soya protein, we also have the Biopolis expansion in Valencia. We have PetDine expansion coming up. So, the business is -- has a long list of organic growth capacity that will come to help next year. But again, it\u2019s all the problem of maybe a strong successful sales and marketing organization, driving double-digit growth rates.\nVikram Luthar: Yes. And Ben, on the FX side, just a reminder for everyone, right. In 2020, we grew operating profit 37%, in 2021 nutrition profit was 20%. If you look at the FX over that two-year period, it was almost flat, went up one year, went down the other year. But the European part of our business, EMEA, and we referenced this in our Global Investor Day, the revenue contribution from Europe is about 40% of the Human Nutrition side and about 20% on the Animal Nutrition side, and that\u2019s getting bigger because of the event. So consequently, given the profitability there and the significant move in the dollar this year, we thought it was appropriate to highlight the growth on a like-for-like basis, which basically means on a constant currency basis. So, it\u2019s a significant strengthening of the dollar. That basically called this out and the underlying growth in the European region.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.\nJuan Luciano: Alex, maybe we skip to the next question. Maybe, Alan, come back later.\nOperator: We will move on. Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of JP Morgan.\nTom Palmer: I wanted to ask on the barge delays on the Mississippi River. Does this have much effect on your business as we look towards the fourth quarter? Is it -- if there is impact, should we mainly think about it being in Ag Services, or just given the diversity of your business, are there offsets to consider?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Of course, we have an unprecedented situation and especially in the Lower Mississippi River that will reduce the volume of exports for Ag Services North America. As it\u2019s going to be a negative impact in Ag Services North America, of course, that -- part of that is because of soy and we\u2019re going to lose that volume. In the corn side, we\u2019re probably going to extend the window of exports from North America into the first quarter. So part of the offset is you\u2019re going to see that in the first quarter. I think also part of the offset is South America will be able to export more. We are a large exporter in South America, of course, and you\u2019re going to see that. And then normally, what we noticed or we expect to happen because we\u2019ve seen it before, is when you export less from North America, where destination marketing sometimes get a little bit of a pop in margins, the products and destination become naturally more valuable, if you will. That was part of the original strategy of going into destination marketing. And then, the other impact is that as beans are not exported that matters not that much demand, local values come down, local bases come down and that may be a boost for crush that you may be able to crush lower-priced beans or maybe eventually lower-priced corn for Carbohydrate Solutions. So, we see some puts and takes. So probably negative for North America Ag Services and Oilseeds, maybe neutral for Ag Services and positive overall maybe for the whole.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.\nKen Zaslow: Just a couple of questions. One is, can you give a little bit more color on Ag Services and Oilseeds outlook as well as carb guidance? I know you said significantly up and significantly lower, some parameters to that? And then, can you also talk about your nutrition outlook, if your supply chain gets repaired, demand is there, do you think that your long-term growth algorithm is intact? And I\u2019ll leave it there, and I appreciate your time, as always.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ken. Yes, let me address maybe the outlook of Ag Services and Oilseeds, Q4. So, first of all, very dynamic environment, but very positive environment. The teams continue to manage exceptionally well. And demand continues to be very robust. So, as we go forward, Q4 again in Ag Services, I was mentioning, maybe a little bit lower for North American exports, but that will be offset for other things that I explained in the question before. So, we still expect significantly better results in the Q4, barring any big mark-to-market, that\u2019s our expectation at this point in time. Crush margins continue to strengthen. That\u2019s on the strength of feeding animals around the world, but also on the extra demand for oil from all the renewable green diesel or biodiesel around the world. We expect continued strength in global trade and destination market. And as I explained before, I would say the business at this point in time is hitting in all cylinders. So, I would say, the 3 parts of the business will be very robust into bigger than last year, certainly. Maybe Vikram can give a little bit of an update on the other two.\nVikram Luthar: Yes. So on Carbohydrate Solutions, you\u2019re right, we did say significantly lower. But if you look at the two independent parts, S&S, sweeteners and starches, we continue to expect that to be strong. We\u2019re seeing robust volumes and margins with obviously, the corn oil benefits we are seeing. So net corn costs are attractive as well as margins continue to be attractive. The issue is on ethanol. Lastly, if you remember, we actually had $1-plus ethanol margins. This year, we clearly do not anticipate margins to be that high. We still expect to be healthy given continued strong gasoline demand, the discount that ethanol has versus RBOB as well as the reasonable inventory levels. So, it\u2019s really the ethanol side that is going to drive the significantly lower performance in Carbohydrate Solutions Q4 to Q4. On the nutrition side, yes, as Juan said, we are working and prioritizing unlocking capacity. We anticipate much of that to get unlocked over the course of 2023. And on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect growth going forward to be in that 15-plus-percent range. It\u2019s important to highlight constant currency because that part of the business in Europe, as I mentioned, is becoming bigger and bigger. And that\u2019s clearly -- and currency is not something we can control and important therefore for us to call that out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley.\nSteven Haynes: I just wanted to ask on the Brazil-China corn export agreement and see if you could get a little bit of color on any impact you think you\u2019ll see in your businesses? And if you can just kind of remind us of how big your export origination footprint is in Brazil versus North America? Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Good morning. So first thing you need to understand is we are living in a very tight global corn environment. So, if you put yourself in the foot of China, China finds itself with lower production, lower domestic production of corn with certainly higher feed demand lower barley and sorghum imports. So naturally, it will have to import more corn. So in my mind, they are just building origin optionality. Again, you have still the La Ni\u00f1a effect in Argentina. So they are planting less corn there. Certainly, our last check up here, yields for corn in North America were going to be lower. And of course, there\u2019s always the uncertainty of Ukraine ability to export. So I think that from a Chinese perspective, this is nothing more than just risk management and expanding open up another optionality. Of course, we are a large exporter from South America as well. We have a very robust Ag Services business in Brazil. And I remind you, we are the largest exporter of corn from Argentina. So, as always, we will offer Black Sea, we will offer North America, we will offer Brazil, and we will offer Argentine origins to China. So, as long as demand remains tight, we will see a lot of activity within the trade flow because naturally people want optionality, so.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson of Jefferies.\nRob Dickerson: I guess, just first question, kind of a broad question. There are a number of times you said in the commentary upfront that should be ongoing momentum kind of going into 2023, and it sounds like more specifically kind of in Q1. If we think about just kind of the general macro backdrop, right, all the tailwinds that are benefiting the business, and maybe this is a little dumb down for some, but not for me. Maybe you could just kind of touch on what could be some drivers that could loosen the overall tightness in the supply chain as we get through next year? Then I have a follow-up.\nJuan Luciano: Okay. So, let me talk a little bit. As I said, we are finishing a very strong 2022, and that will get us into a strong -- with good momentum into 2023. What are the things that we are seeing because of course, I mean, it\u2019s difficult place to prognosticate these days. But we anticipate ongoing resilient demand for our products. We have not seen, maybe with the exceptions of some tiny businesses in Animal Nutrition. We have not seen a deceleration of demand across ADM at this point in time. We foresee also a strong crush margin environment based on the two legs. We have a strong pork and poultry feeding demand across the world. And we see tight soybean oil stocks and RGD and biodiesel demand that continues to be strong and growing. We see, as Vikram expressed before, a positive outlook for starches and sweeteners. We have finished some of our contracting, and we see the volume, and we see the margins holding or slightly expanding there. And we see a continuation of our growth trajectory in Nutrition. When I talk about the pipeline, that\u2019s the business in which we have the biggest visibility into the future because these are projects that, barring any supply issues, we will bring to the P&L. So, I would say that is what gives us some positive momentum or positive expectations for \u201823. You have to remember also that we dealt with a lot of weather issues, logistical issues, whether it is the river, whether there is hurricanes -- many issues. And we had, as I explained before, some manufacturing volumes impact here and there. We expect that all to be corrected and to be potentially a plus into next year. And as I explained in the Nutrition question, we have new capacity coming on stream. We have -- we are expanding Biopolis probiotics capacity by a factor of 5. We are bringing a new line for plant-based proteins in soya protein. We are expanding our PetDine capacity. So, we are bringing a lot of new capacity to bear because we have the pipeline to actually transfer them into profit. So, from what we can see here, and again, in a very uncertain world, is we have good -- very good momentum going into 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. I\u2019d like to better understand this regenerative ag outlook you have for $100 million of operating profit in five years. Would it be reasonable to assume that that\u2019s roughly 10 million acres of $10 an acre operating profit? Is that kind of where you\u2019re thinking? And maybe more broadly, do you see the value here more on generating grain that has been produced in some kind of sustainable way i.e., that a CPG customer of yours would be willing to pay a premium for that grain? Or do you see this as really the generation of carbon credits that could be sold on various exchanges? I welcome your thoughts on that.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you. Very good question and something that is very close to our heart and tied to our strategy. The Regen Ag programs and acres are certainly in high demand. We have made public one announcement, but we have been working on what we call the differentiated bushel, if you will, for like three or four years already. And ADM naturally sits in a unique place in the value chain, and we have the global scale to drive improvements in agriculture, and we have the ability to tie both the farmer with the CPG companies, and so this is a privileged position. We are working very hard to simplify the process for the farmer. And as you described, there are many ways to potentially create value here. When we thought about the differentiated bushel, one is as you described, eventually, and we\u2019re seeing more evidence of that, there\u2019s going to be a premium price for bushels that are grown or metric tons that are grown in a certain way. And I think that the whole society is looking for that. It\u2019s looking for agriculture to actually do their part in creating a more sustainable world. One is that. The second, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re working with FBN, with Gradable and all that, is to simplify the collection of data and all that in the preparation, we\u2019re working with the government on that, on the protocols to be able to have carbon offsets or carbon credits based on that. So, it\u2019s a little bit of both. The economics that you described are not as simple as $10 per ton or whatever. But to a certain degree, that they are also not that much more complicated than that. We just have a portfolio of different accounts and different contracts, and they\u2019re all slightly different, but it is conceptually aligned to what you described is converting more acres, it\u2019s signing more acres. That\u2019s where we leverage the relationship we have with farmers globally. ADM has 220,000 farmers portfolio in the world that we are engaged in discussing this. Of course, the customer -- the farmers will embrace these as they see more demand for this. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have the CPG companies aligned to this. And that\u2019s why we make these agreements because, of course, the farmer will generate the production in order to satisfy the demand. So, both lines need to grow together. So again, I think we are just leveraging our incredible farmer network and the desire of CPG companies and consumer in general, to see bushels or metric tons grown in a differentiated way. So, we\u2019re very excited about the future of this.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Larson of Seaport Research Partners.\nEric Larson: Congratulations on a good quarter, everyone. So, the question I have is -- and thank you for all your regen comments, Juan, it\u2019s pretty dear to our heart to result. I\u2019m looking forward to even having more discussions on that. The question I would have this morning is, could you give us a little more detail on the situation in Ukraine? What you folks are seeing? We\u2019re hearing that there are only plant -- only able to plant enough winter wheat this year to even meet kind of their own domestic needs for next year? It seems that maybe Ukraine is going to be an even smaller contributor to global exports, both on the oil season and grains next year. I guess, it\u2019s just hard to get all the information put together. Could you just share some thoughts on what you see developing in that region of the world?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Eric. And also, it gives me an opportunity to emphasize the message we sent to our employees in Ukraine to -- for strength and ADM is doing everything possible to make their lives as bearable as possible through all these. And hopefully, one day, we will be talking about the rebuilding of Ukraine and all of them coming back to their land. So listen, we\u2019ve been involved. As you know, we have more than 650 employees. So, we\u2019ve been deeply involved in that. A vast majority of them are in their jobs, in their positions right now. So we\u2019ve been able to export from Ukraine and the industry has worked together with governments and through this corridor agreement, we\u2019ve been able to, in September, to reach the same level of exports almost that Ukraine used to have last year, so about 7 million tons. October, starting with a little bit more of wrinkles, if you will. We are having an issue, which is this joint group that is supposed to inspect the vessels have been a little bit overwhelmed by the number of vessels that we have. So they are adding more people to that group in order to continue to move material. We need to move material. There are like 100 vessels, give or take, in a queue right now. We need to take that material out because storage in Ukraine is becoming full. And then, there\u2019s going to be a harvest and we need to be able to use that storage to harvest the material and to store the material there. So, my point to all this is dynamic. This continues to be a very dynamic environment. Certainly, there are still shelling in the area sometimes, hitting some of the soybean oil, sunseed oil tanks, if you will. So, this is not an easy area. In the middle of that, of course, Ukraine is trying to plant, as you described, difficult to judge a number. I mean, our estimate is that maybe 30% less, but it\u2019s difficult to make the calculation because some territory are now claimed to be in Russian control. So, it\u2019s difficult for us to know even when data are put together, if you will, if that counts with the planting in that Russian controlled territory or not. So, I would say, it\u2019s a little bit difficult to make prognostications. So wheat, thankfully, Australia has a good crop. It has rained a lot in Australia. So, that\u2019s a positive of the La Ni\u00f1a. Hopefully we stop now with the rain because they need to harvest and we don\u2019t want damage into the harvest. India also has declared there are some inventories and can come to the world to help. Corn situation, certainly more difficult maybe. There is a strong demand. We are in coarse grains in the tightest inventories in the world that we have in seven years. So I think that will be complicated. As I said, Argentina has planted like 10% of the first corn because of incredible drought there. So, I think that at this point in time, the U.S. will be a big supplier of corn for the world. On sun oil, I think the world adjusts a little bit more to present in different blends of different oils. But of course, the oil environment is tight because of all the renewable green diesel and biodiesel. So I would say maybe wheat is a little bit better, but corn and sun oil will be difficult if we stop with the corridor. So hopefully, now November 19, the corridor gets extended. And everything we hear at this point in time, there may be an objection here or there, but nothing significant that could derail this. So we are still counting that the corridor will continue to function, hopefully, with a little bit more efficiency as we appoint more inspectors on with the joint committee.\nOperator: Next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: I was hoping you could give a little more color on the outsized performance in Ag Services in the quarter. I mean, this is the strongest third quarter I think I\u2019ve seen from ADM in many years. And it\u2019s not what I would have expected given the challenges on the Mississippi River. So, of these factors that you mentioned, the short crop in South America, the better margins in ocean freight, can you give us kind of some sizing as to what were the biggest factors for the outperformance? And also, was there any kind of positioning benefit from your -- from how you hedged your grain in the quarter?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. So, it was a great performance, as you described, very proud of the team. Traditionally, our Q3s have lower volumes because we are getting out of the end of the season and waiting for the next harvest. What happened this time is I think given the short South American crop, we\u2019ve been able to move more volumes, especially exports in North America. Exports were down Q3 to Q2, but not down as much as maybe you see in other years. The same has been a little bit for origination volumes. And when exports go, we have benefits in our transportation businesses, our barges and all that. Also, do not forget, it\u2019s not just North America, but it\u2019s also the global nature. The global trades have done a spectacular performance. And I think we have benefits in ocean freight. It was a very good quarter from that perspective, and also destination market. In destination market that we started four or five years ago, I don\u2019t remember exactly, has continued to grow volumes and expanding margins. So that, I would say, is what created this great Ag Services in Q3. So, great performance by the team.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: So, a lot of ground has been covered today. I wanted to maybe come to capital allocation on the balance sheet. And first, just to clarify on repurchase because you did a very sizable amount of buybacks in the third quarter. The incremental $1 billion was over the next five quarters. Did I understand that right from the earlier comments? And then just more broadly, Juan, Vikram, any way to frame CapEx over the -- into 2023 kind of -- you got a lot of capacity actions underway. Just help frame kind of the internal investments. And relatedly, help us think about maybe the M&A optionality in the current marketplace, especially with rising interest rates that might put some more working capital strain on smaller players in the market? Thank you.\nVikram Luthar: Yes. Adam, thanks for the question. So, in terms of the share buybacks, yes, we -- as you rightly noted, we did execute the entire $1 since we announced it in -- the buyback in Q2. Looking forward, you\u2019re right, in terms of the additional buyback, that is anticipated to be completed over the next five quarters through the end of 2023. But I also want to emphasize, partially getting to one of your questions that we see a rich pipeline of opportunities even on the M&A side. And it is, as always, our responsibility to continue evaluating that. And if we find the right acquisition with the right set of capabilities at the right price, absolutely, we would divert potential capital to that in lieu of buybacks. But absent that, we anticipate to complete this by the end of 2023. In terms of CapEx, we had signaled about $1.3 billion for this year. We remain on track to be around that, maybe slightly under. And we anticipate that similar level of spend to continue over the next couple of years as well, given the significant need for adding capacity as Juan mentioned, but also some of the additional high-return projects we see on the horizon, such as the analytics and digital automation of our facilities. So, we see rich opportunities to reinvest in the business as well as potentially explore more M&A. One other point that\u2019s very important to highlight, and this really underscores our emphasis on driving returns, which is not just focusing on the profitability but also on the asset, on the denominator is a $1 billion challenge. Even in the face of this outstanding performance this year, the teams are rigorously focused on reducing the assets deployed to produce that profit. And the $1 billion challenge, we actually anticipated to -- we\u2019ve actually got -- we\u2019ve got cash in hand as of last week of $1 billion, as Juan noted. So, I think it\u2019s important to note that we are very focused on driving returns and hence that 13% that we are very proud of we achieved in 3Q. So, I\u2019ll pause there.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions for today. So, I\u2019ll hand back to Megan Britt for any further remarks.\nMegan Britt: Thank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day, and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan. This morning, we reported a strong third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.6 billion. Our trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA approached $6.6 billion, and our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13%. Throughout the quarter, our 40,000 colleagues around the globe continued to deliver on our purpose by supporting the global food system and providing needed nutrition to billions. Global demand for our products remained robust, and our ability to meet customer needs demonstrated our team's expertise in managing dynamic market conditions as well as the unique benefits of our integrated global value chain and product portfolio. We continue to generate strong cash flows, which support the continued advancement of our strategy, including investments in new capabilities and growth engines across our three businesses and the return of capital to our shareholders. Next slide, please. Even as the team demonstrated superb day-to-day execution in the third quarter, we continued to make great progress on driving our strategic growth priorities. In each of our business segments, we've created and are continuing to build new growth engines that are aligned with enduring global trends. As demand for more sustainable produced low carbon intensity products continues to drive growth across our portfolio, our AS&O team signed a groundbreaking long-term strategic agreement with PepsiCo to enroll up to 2 million regenerative agricultural acres over the next 7.5 years. I'll be talking more about our regen ag efforts in a moment. Sustainability from demand for sustainable package into the ongoing energy transformation supported by policies like the inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. is also driving the evolution of our Carbohydrate Solutions business. In the third quarter, for example, we formally signed two joint ventures with LG Chem for U.S. production of lactic acid and polylactic acid for a variety of applications, including bioplastics. Both sustainability and food security are powering our growth in nutrition, including our continued investment in alternative proteins. In Q3, we advanced several alternative protein enhancements and expansions, including an agreement with Benson Hill for the exclusive rights to process and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary ingredients derived from their ultra-high protein soybeans. Each of these investments is aligned with global trends and each demonstrates how we are advancing new avenues of growth across all three of our business segments. Slide 5, please. Our strategic work remains focused on two pillars: productivity and innovation. As we discussed at our Global Investor Day last December, we are targeting $1.1 billion in benefits from our productivity efforts, which improve our long-term returns profile while helping us mitigate the impact of market forces, including inflation. Strong returns means focusing on both, the numerator and the denominator. That is why around the globe, our team is continuing to identify opportunities to monetize assets and optimize working capital as part of our $1 billion challenge. As of last week, we had realized cash generation in excess of $1 billion from this initiative. On the numerator side, we're investing in new technologies to enhance our efficiencies. Last quarter, I highlighted the operational transformation of our core facility in Marshall, Minnesota, and discussed how we hope to emulate that success more widely across our production footprint. We are now advancing an ambitious plan to install enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics and more than 50 production facilities globally with further expansion possible as we evaluate and size the opportunities. These investments will enable us to unlock capacity, improve reliability and enhance safety. We are currently evaluating partners to support us in this important work, which we intend to execute in a phased approach, focusing on 8 to 10 facilities per year. We anticipate investing more than $1 billion over this period, and we expect double-digit returns on this investment as we are seeing in Marshall. We'll be updating you on our progress towards these goals and other productivity efforts on upcoming calls. Next slide, please. Turning to innovation. Sustainability is driving force both of our purpose and our growth strategy. And one great example is the scaling up of our regenerative agricultural efforts. regen ag practices include cover cropping, improved nutrient management and conservation tillage. The environmental and climate benefits associated with regen ag can include greenhouse gas emissions reductions, increased soil carbon sequestration, water quality improvements and biodiversity promotion. With global scale and a value chain that reaches from 220,000 farmers to customers ranging from multinational CPGs to start-ups, ADM has a unique opportunity to lead in this area. I already mentioned our strategic partnership with PepsiCo, which we believe is truly groundbreaking in its scope and long-term vision. We're working with other partners as well. For example, in the spring, we announced an agreement with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation that includes a commitment of $20 million to sign up more regen ag acres. And we're partnering with Farmers Business Network to make their gradable farm management platform available as a regen ag technology enabler for our North American farmer base. We've signed about 750,000 unique regen ag acres in the U.S. so far this year. We expect this number to grow with every passing year. These programs are getting us closer to farmers and closer to our customers. And we anticipate that within the next five years, our annual operating profit impact from this work will reach more than $100 million, while continuing to help lead our industry to a more responsible, sustainable future. While we are on the subject of sustainability, I'm very proud that some of the good work we've done in this arena is being recognized. Just yesterday, ADM was included on the Investor's Business Daily annual list of 100 Best ESG Companies. And in July, Environment and Energy Leader magazine recognized our Illinois-based indicator carbon capture and storage partnership as a top project for energy and environmental management. We posted a new update on our website that details our progress in advancing our Strive 35 goals, including our commitment to reduce our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2035. And because Strive 35 isn't the end of our sustainability journey, that update includes our aspiration to work towards net zero emissions by 2050. We'll have more to say about this as we continue to evaluate and develop our path forward. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram? Thank you, Vikram. Slide 12, please. So to recap, our team delivered another outstanding quarter. And thanks to our execution and the advancement of our strategy, we are well positioned to end 2022 strong. Last quarter, we said we were expecting full year earnings higher than $6.50 per share. Based on where we are today, we now clearly expect to exceed $7 per share. Looking ahead, there are several externalities that we are monitoring going into 2023. We anticipate ongoing resilient demand for our products, a strong crush margin environment, a positive outlook for starches and sweeteners, and a continuation of our growth trajectory in Nutrition. There is also significant uncertainty in the global economy and geopolitical environment. We expect to carry our strong momentum into the first quarter of 2022. And beyond that, we are confident that our scenario planning and execution will give us the ability to effectively manage through a dynamic environment. We're also going to continue to benefit from our strategic work, and we'll continue to deliver on those priorities throughout 2023. We'll advance productivity initiatives to improve operations and processes, optimize costs and enhance efficiencies. We'll drive innovation, expanding and creating new growth engines across our entire business portfolio, Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition. And we'll advance those strategic objectives as we always have, alongside our team's exceptional day-to-day execution, delivering for our colleagues, consumers, customers and stakeholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Thank you, Ben. Yes, as you noted, we had lower volumes, and part of that were coming from Europe in soil and rape. We had some adverse weather and some logistical constraints in Europe in terms of navigation, some of the rivers. We also have a reduction in South America, in soy crush because of Paraguay shutdown, mostly because of lack of beans. We had also some reductions in North America due to canola seed availability. And certainly, we have our Ukraine sun crush facility down, as you know, since last March. So, we have 850 facilities around the world, as you know. And we deal with logistics, with adverse weather with manpower issues like every company out there. So, that what was the decline in volumes at this point in time. As some of those one-off issues subside, I mean, we will see those volumes coming back to normal rates. Yes. Thank you, Ben. Listen, as Vikram mentioned in his commentary, we are exceptionally proud of how the team is generating demand, how our value proposition in Nutrition continues to resonate and attract customers. Our pipeline has never been bigger and our growth rates continue to be -- our winning rates continue to be off the chart. So, the problem with that is that it catches up with your production pretty quickly. And although we have plans to expand those, some of the supply chain issues in delivery equipment and all that, sometimes don't play exactly in our favor. When you look at where specifically those issues have impacted us the most, it has been in flavors, I would say, and mostly in North America, but some of that in Europe. On the other hand, the facility that we inaugurated last year, Pinghu in China has suffered from lack of volumes because of the lockdowns due to COVID restrictions in China. So, I would say, we had a little bit upset in the sense that we couldn't bring all that demand that we have generated into the P&L. And certainly, those things are, to a certain degree, now under control. And as you can imagine, everybody in the Company is driving very hard to bring extra capacity. As you know, on the last quarter or a couple of quarters ago, we bought FISA precisely to alleviate a little bit that. Of course, we're using contract manufacturing. So, we are pulling everything. But in a very tight environment with also some shifting of demand based on consumer demand, customers are shifting some of that demand, our ability to react promptly to that given the high growth rates caught up with us in the quarter. There is a lot of capacity coming for next year. So first of all, all this is an upside for next year. Hopefully, we're going to be able to fulfill all that demand next year. But there is also expansions. If you think about -- we have a new line in soya protein, we also have the Biopolis expansion in Valencia. We have PetDine expansion coming up. So, the business is -- has a long list of organic growth capacity that will come to help next year. But again, it's all the problem of maybe a strong successful sales and marketing organization, driving double-digit growth rates. Alex, maybe we skip to the next question. Maybe, Alan, come back later. Yes. Of course, we have an unprecedented situation and especially in the Lower Mississippi River that will reduce the volume of exports for Ag Services North America. As it's going to be a negative impact in Ag Services North America, of course, that -- part of that is because of soy and we're going to lose that volume. In the corn side, we're probably going to extend the window of exports from North America into the first quarter. So part of the offset is you're going to see that in the first quarter. I think also part of the offset is South America will be able to export more. We are a large exporter in South America, of course, and you're going to see that. And then normally, what we noticed or we expect to happen because we've seen it before, is when you export less from North America, where destination marketing sometimes get a little bit of a pop in margins, the products and destination become naturally more valuable, if you will. That was part of the original strategy of going into destination marketing. And then, the other impact is that as beans are not exported that matters not that much demand, local values come down, local bases come down and that may be a boost for crush that you may be able to crush lower-priced beans or maybe eventually lower-priced corn for Carbohydrate Solutions. So, we see some puts and takes. So probably negative for North America Ag Services and Oilseeds, maybe neutral for Ag Services and positive overall maybe for the whole. Thank you, Ken. Yes, let me address maybe the outlook of Ag Services and Oilseeds, Q4. So, first of all, very dynamic environment, but very positive environment. The teams continue to manage exceptionally well. And demand continues to be very robust. So, as we go forward, Q4 again in Ag Services, I was mentioning, maybe a little bit lower for North American exports, but that will be offset for other things that I explained in the question before. So, we still expect significantly better results in the Q4, barring any big mark-to-market, that's our expectation at this point in time. Crush margins continue to strengthen. That's on the strength of feeding animals around the world, but also on the extra demand for oil from all the renewable green diesel or biodiesel around the world. We expect continued strength in global trade and destination market. And as I explained before, I would say the business at this point in time is hitting in all cylinders. So, I would say, the 3 parts of the business will be very robust into bigger than last year, certainly. Maybe Vikram can give a little bit of an update on the other two. Yes. Good morning. So first thing you need to understand is we are living in a very tight global corn environment. So, if you put yourself in the foot of China, China finds itself with lower production, lower domestic production of corn with certainly higher feed demand lower barley and sorghum imports. So naturally, it will have to import more corn. So in my mind, they are just building origin optionality. Again, you have still the La Nin\u0303a effect in Argentina. So they are planting less corn there. Certainly, our last check up here, yields for corn in North America were going to be lower. And of course, there's always the uncertainty of Ukraine ability to export. So I think that from a Chinese perspective, this is nothing more than just risk management and expanding open up another optionality. Of course, we are a large exporter from South America as well. We have a very robust Ag Services business in Brazil. And I remind you, we are the largest exporter of corn from Argentina. So, as always, we will offer Black Sea, we will offer North America, we will offer Brazil, and we will offer Argentine origins to China. So, as long as demand remains tight, we will see a lot of activity within the trade flow because naturally people want optionality, so. Okay. So, let me talk a little bit. As I said, we are finishing a very strong 2022, and that will get us into a strong -- with good momentum into 2023. What are the things that we are seeing because of course, I mean, it's difficult place to prognosticate these days. But we anticipate ongoing resilient demand for our products. We have not seen, maybe with the exceptions of some tiny businesses in Animal Nutrition. We have not seen a deceleration of demand across ADM at this point in time. We foresee also a strong crush margin environment based on the two legs. We have a strong pork and poultry feeding demand across the world. And we see tight soybean oil stocks and RGD and biodiesel demand that continues to be strong and growing. We see, as Vikram expressed before, a positive outlook for starches and sweeteners. We have finished some of our contracting, and we see the volume, and we see the margins holding or slightly expanding there. And we see a continuation of our growth trajectory in Nutrition. When I talk about the pipeline, that's the business in which we have the biggest visibility into the future because these are projects that, barring any supply issues, we will bring to the P&L. So, I would say that is what gives us some positive momentum or positive expectations for \u201823. You have to remember also that we dealt with a lot of weather issues, logistical issues, whether it is the river, whether there is hurricanes -- many issues. And we had, as I explained before, some manufacturing volumes impact here and there. We expect that all to be corrected and to be potentially a plus into next year. And as I explained in the Nutrition question, we have new capacity coming on stream. We have -- we are expanding Biopolis probiotics capacity by a factor of 5. We are bringing a new line for plant-based proteins in soya protein. We are expanding our PetDine capacity. So, we are bringing a lot of new capacity to bear because we have the pipeline to actually transfer them into profit. So, from what we can see here, and again, in a very uncertain world, is we have good -- very good momentum going into 2023. Yes. Thank you. Very good question and something that is very close to our heart and tied to our strategy. The Regen Ag programs and acres are certainly in high demand. We have made public one announcement, but we have been working on what we call the differentiated bushel, if you will, for like three or four years already. And ADM naturally sits in a unique place in the value chain, and we have the global scale to drive improvements in agriculture, and we have the ability to tie both the farmer with the CPG companies, and so this is a privileged position. We are working very hard to simplify the process for the farmer. And as you described, there are many ways to potentially create value here. When we thought about the differentiated bushel, one is as you described, eventually, and we're seeing more evidence of that, there's going to be a premium price for bushels that are grown or metric tons that are grown in a certain way. And I think that the whole society is looking for that. It's looking for agriculture to actually do their part in creating a more sustainable world. One is that. The second, and that's where we're working with FBN, with Gradable and all that, is to simplify the collection of data and all that in the preparation, we're working with the government on that, on the protocols to be able to have carbon offsets or carbon credits based on that. So, it's a little bit of both. The economics that you described are not as simple as $10 per ton or whatever. But to a certain degree, that they are also not that much more complicated than that. We just have a portfolio of different accounts and different contracts, and they're all slightly different, but it is conceptually aligned to what you described is converting more acres, it's signing more acres. That's where we leverage the relationship we have with farmers globally. ADM has 220,000 farmers portfolio in the world that we are engaged in discussing this. Of course, the customer -- the farmers will embrace these as they see more demand for this. That's why it's important to have the CPG companies aligned to this. And that's why we make these agreements because, of course, the farmer will generate the production in order to satisfy the demand. So, both lines need to grow together. So again, I think we are just leveraging our incredible farmer network and the desire of CPG companies and consumer in general, to see bushels or metric tons grown in a differentiated way. So, we're very excited about the future of this. Yes. Thank you, Eric. And also, it gives me an opportunity to emphasize the message we sent to our employees in Ukraine to -- for strength and ADM is doing everything possible to make their lives as bearable as possible through all these. And hopefully, one day, we will be talking about the rebuilding of Ukraine and all of them coming back to their land. So listen, we've been involved. As you know, we have more than 650 employees. So, we've been deeply involved in that. A vast majority of them are in their jobs, in their positions right now. So we've been able to export from Ukraine and the industry has worked together with governments and through this corridor agreement, we've been able to, in September, to reach the same level of exports almost that Ukraine used to have last year, so about 7 million tons. October, starting with a little bit more of wrinkles, if you will. We are having an issue, which is this joint group that is supposed to inspect the vessels have been a little bit overwhelmed by the number of vessels that we have. So they are adding more people to that group in order to continue to move material. We need to move material. There are like 100 vessels, give or take, in a queue right now. We need to take that material out because storage in Ukraine is becoming full. And then, there's going to be a harvest and we need to be able to use that storage to harvest the material and to store the material there. So, my point to all this is dynamic. This continues to be a very dynamic environment. Certainly, there are still shelling in the area sometimes, hitting some of the soybean oil, sunseed oil tanks, if you will. So, this is not an easy area. In the middle of that, of course, Ukraine is trying to plant, as you described, difficult to judge a number. I mean, our estimate is that maybe 30% less, but it's difficult to make the calculation because some territory are now claimed to be in Russian control. So, it's difficult for us to know even when data are put together, if you will, if that counts with the planting in that Russian controlled territory or not. So, I would say, it's a little bit difficult to make prognostications. So wheat, thankfully, Australia has a good crop. It has rained a lot in Australia. So, that's a positive of the La Nin\u0303a. Hopefully we stop now with the rain because they need to harvest and we don't want damage into the harvest. India also has declared there are some inventories and can come to the world to help. Corn situation, certainly more difficult maybe. There is a strong demand. We are in coarse grains in the tightest inventories in the world that we have in seven years. So I think that will be complicated. As I said, Argentina has planted like 10% of the first corn because of incredible drought there. So, I think that at this point in time, the U.S. will be a big supplier of corn for the world. On sun oil, I think the world adjusts a little bit more to present in different blends of different oils. But of course, the oil environment is tight because of all the renewable green diesel and biodiesel. So I would say maybe wheat is a little bit better, but corn and sun oil will be difficult if we stop with the corridor. So hopefully, now November 19, the corridor gets extended. And everything we hear at this point in time, there may be an objection here or there, but nothing significant that could derail this. So we are still counting that the corridor will continue to function, hopefully, with a little bit more efficiency as we appoint more inspectors on with the joint committee. Yes. So, it was a great performance, as you described, very proud of the team. Traditionally, our Q3s have lower volumes because we are getting out of the end of the season and waiting for the next harvest. What happened this time is I think given the short South American crop, we've been able to move more volumes, especially exports in North America. Exports were down Q3 to Q2, but not down as much as maybe you see in other years. The same has been a little bit for origination volumes. And when exports go, we have benefits in our transportation businesses, our barges and all that. Also, do not forget, it's not just North America, but it's also the global nature. The global trades have done a spectacular performance. And I think we have benefits in ocean freight. It was a very good quarter from that perspective, and also destination market. In destination market that we started four or five years ago, I don't remember exactly, has continued to grow volumes and expanding margins. So that, I would say, is what created this great Ag Services in Q3. So, great performance by the team."

            "content": "Thanks, Juan. Slide 7, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered substantially higher year-over-year results. Ag Services results were significantly higher than the third quarter of 2021. The short crops in South America supported U.S. exports, driving improved volumes and margins in North American origination, which had significant negative impacts from Hurricane Ida in the prior year. Better margins in global ocean freight, driven by good execution amid dynamic global trade flows, powered better results in global trade. South American origination saw improved volumes and margins driven by increased farmer selling in addition to higher volumes through our export facilities. Crushing results were significantly higher with margins driven by resilient global demand for both meal and oil. Strong rapeseed margins in EMEA, driven by robust oil demand and continued market dislocations along with positive impacts from an insurance settlement helped drive improved results. North American soy crush margins continued to benefit from renewable diesel demand. Also, net positive timing effects in the quarter were about $175 million as compared to the approximately $70 million in the prior year quarter. Positive results were partially offset by lower crush volumes, including impacts from idle facilities in Ukraine and Paraguay. Refined products and other results were higher year-over-year in a strong margin environment for both refined oil and biodiesel. Robust performance in global refined oils was driven by healthy demand and elevated refined oil margins amid supply chain disruptions. Equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher versus the third quarter of 2021. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect AS&O to deliver much better results in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect continued strength in crush margins to more than offset the adverse impact of low water conditions on U.S. export volumes. Slide 8, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team delivered significantly higher results versus the prior year quarter. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much improved year-over-year results amid steady global demand for sweeteners and starches. Corn co-products, including continued robust demand for corn oil as well as effective risk management drove higher execution margins in North America. Wheat milling had a strong performance, delivering improved volumes and margins to meet healthy demand for flower. In EMEA, the business delivered solid volumes and margins and managed through a dynamic energy environment to drive stronger results. Our BioSolutions platform continued its upward trajectory with 29% year-over-year revenue growth year-to-date. Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially lower. Ethanol margins were pressured by higher industry inventories, lower domestic demand and elevated corn costs. In addition, the prior year's results included contributions from the now sold Peoria facility. Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter of this year for Carbohydrate Solutions to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Demand and margins for sweeteners, starches and flower should remain healthy, but ethanol margins are expected to be substantially lower than last year's historic highs. On slide 9, the Nutrition business continued to outpace the industry with Q3 revenue growth of 10% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter adjusted operating profit was similar to last year and 7% higher on a constant currency basis. Profit was impacted in the quarter by the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar and demand fulfillment challenges as the rapid growth in customer demand exceeded our operational capacity. We are prioritizing unlocking capacity in the face of some persistent supply chain bottlenecks. Our year-to-date performance remains very strong, including 20% revenue and 19% OP growth on a constant currency basis. And our portfolio of acquisitions from 2021 continues to deliver OP above our acquisition models. In this quarter, Human Nutrition results were higher than the third quarter of 2021. We strong demand for plant-based proteins as well as solid performance in texturants drove continued growth in specialty ingredients. Flavors results were impacted by adverse currency translation effects in EMEA, partially offset by continued strong demand growth in the region. Demand fulfillment challenges in North America and lower demand in APAC, driven partly by the lockdowns in China also negatively impacted results. Health and Wellness was lower versus the prior year, which included higher income from the fiber fermentation agreement. Animal Nutrition results were down versus the prior year quarter. Pet results were lower in Latin America on lower volumes, partially offset by strong volumes and margins in North America. Softer animal protein demand affected feed volumes. Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter for Nutrition this year to be higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 with continued strong demand in human nutrition more than offsetting adverse currency effects. We expect Nutrition's full year OP growth to be between 15% and 20% on a constant currency basis. Slide 10, please. Other business results increased from the prior year quarter. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services, partially offset by increased claim settlements in captive insurance. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $251 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to performance-related compensation accruals, higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the Company's centers of excellence. Other Corporate was favorable versus the prior year, primarily due to higher results from foreign currency-related hedge activity. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher interest rates. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately 16%. We still project full year corporate costs to be about $1.3 billion, and we still expect our adjusted tax rate to remain in the range of 16% to 19%. Next slide, please. Year-to-date, operating cash flows, before working capital of $4.7 billion, are up significantly versus $3.1 billion over the same period last year. Our net debt to total capital ratio is about 24%, and we have available liquidity of about $11.2 billion. We are continuing to invest in the business with $841 million in capital expenditures and have returned capital to shareholders with $677 million in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter, which reflects the completion of the $1 billion stock buyback announced last quarter. And with enhanced financial flexibility and in line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of shares by the end of 2023, subject to other strategic uses of capital. Juan? Yes. And Ben, on the FX side, just a reminder for everyone, right. In 2020, we grew operating profit 37%, in 2021 nutrition profit was 20%. If you look at the FX over that two-year period, it was almost flat, went up one year, went down the other year. But the European part of our business, EMEA, and we referenced this in our Global Investor Day, the revenue contribution from Europe is about 40% of the Human Nutrition side and about 20% on the Animal Nutrition side, and that's getting bigger because of the event. So consequently, given the profitability there and the significant move in the dollar this year, we thought it was appropriate to highlight the growth on a like-for-like basis, which basically means on a constant currency basis. So, it's a significant strengthening of the dollar. That basically called this out and the underlying growth in the European region. Yes. So on Carbohydrate Solutions, you're right, we did say significantly lower. But if you look at the two independent parts, S&S, sweeteners and starches, we continue to expect that to be strong. We're seeing robust volumes and margins with obviously, the corn oil benefits we are seeing. So net corn costs are attractive as well as margins continue to be attractive. The issue is on ethanol. Lastly, if you remember, we actually had $1-plus ethanol margins. This year, we clearly do not anticipate margins to be that high. We still expect to be healthy given continued strong gasoline demand, the discount that ethanol has versus RBOB as well as the reasonable inventory levels. So, it's really the ethanol side that is going to drive the significantly lower performance in Carbohydrate Solutions Q4 to Q4. On the nutrition side, yes, as Juan said, we are working and prioritizing unlocking capacity. We anticipate much of that to get unlocked over the course of 2023. And on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect growth going forward to be in that 15-plus-percent range. It's important to highlight constant currency because that part of the business in Europe, as I mentioned, is becoming bigger and bigger. And that's clearly -- and currency is not something we can control and important therefore for us to call that out. Yes. Adam, thanks for the question. So, in terms of the share buybacks, yes, we -- as you rightly noted, we did execute the entire $1 since we announced it in -- the buyback in Q2. Looking forward, you're right, in terms of the additional buyback, that is anticipated to be completed over the next five quarters through the end of 2023. But I also want to emphasize, partially getting to one of your questions that we see a rich pipeline of opportunities even on the M&A side. And it is, as always, our responsibility to continue evaluating that. And if we find the right acquisition with the right set of capabilities at the right price, absolutely, we would divert potential capital to that in lieu of buybacks. But absent that, we anticipate to complete this by the end of 2023. In terms of CapEx, we had signaled about $1.3 billion for this year. We remain on track to be around that, maybe slightly under. And we anticipate that similar level of spend to continue over the next couple of years as well, given the significant need for adding capacity as Juan mentioned, but also some of the additional high-return projects we see on the horizon, such as the analytics and digital automation of our facilities. So, we see rich opportunities to reinvest in the business as well as potentially explore more M&A. One other point that's very important to highlight, and this really underscores our emphasis on driving returns, which is not just focusing on the profitability but also on the asset, on the denominator is a $1 billion challenge. Even in the face of this outstanding performance this year, the teams are rigorously focused on reducing the assets deployed to produce that profit. And the $1 billion challenge, we actually anticipated to -- we've actually got -- we've got cash in hand as of last week of $1 billion, as Juan noted. So, I think it's important to note that we are very focused on driving returns and hence that 13% that we are very proud of we achieved in 3Q. So, I'll pause there."

Then Juan will make some final comments, and he and Vikram will take your questions. Please turn to Slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Michael. This morning, we reported outstanding second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.15. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.8 billion, and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA approached $6 billion. And our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 11.6%. Our team executed extremely well in the second quarter, navigating dynamic conditions to deliver nutritions to billions. And even as we work tirelessly to serve our customers and consumers around the globe, we are continuing to advance our strategy with productivity initiatives that are improving our efficiency and cost structure and innovation work that is powering profitable growth. Slide 4, please. Productivity is how we are improving our execution and optimizing costs, is key to our long term success but equally and importantly our productivity work is helping us mitigate the impact of inflation. We have a very strong pipeline of productivity initiatives and I will be updating you on them regularly. There are 2 initiatives I'd like to highlight today. First is a set of operational transformation efforts we are driving across production facilities around the globe and spanning all 3 businesses. Earlier this year, we completed a modernization project in our Marshall, Minnesota corn facility that is unlocking significant new value through enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics. We're already seeing double-digit returns on the investment we made in that project. This is an example of the kinds of projects we're undertaking across our operational footprint, designed to unlock incremental volumes and deliver safer, more reliable, more cost-efficient operations. Second, as we look to continue to grow returns, we want to focus not only on the numerator but also the denominator. Our original $1 billion challenge and its follow-up, the next billion, help us drive to 10% ROIC. Earlier this year, we launched a new challenge aimed at monetizing assets and optimizing working capital to unlock another $1 billion in cash, helping us to continue to drive returns. In fact, we already realized more than $400 million. Next slide, please. We're also advancing our innovation pillar, fueling profitable growth as we continue to expand our capabilities to meet demand across the 3 global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. For example, last November, we added significant new capabilities in our Health and Wellness business with the acquisition of Deerland Probiotics. Demand in the human microbiome space is expected to reach $9.1 billion by 2026. While in animal feed, probiotic demand is expected to grow to $6.2 billion. Deerland with a broad portfolio of probiotics, prebiotics and enzymes provides a wide array of commercial, R&D and operations-related synergy opportunities to help us meet that demand. And we're taking advantage of those opportunities from connecting our deal and capabilities with our Biopolis team in Spain to utilize sport probiotics in a functional chocolate bar; to bringing together our expertise to expand our capabilities in pet, a key growth category; to looking across teams to offer new types of dietary supplements. Thanks to the strong collaboration across the enterprise, Deerland today is increasing our share of wallet for customers in both human and pet solutions. And we're seeing similar outcomes from other recent investments as well. In the first half of the year, our combined portfolio of 2021 nutrition acquisitions has delivered significantly more OP than we had in our acquisition models. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?\nVikram Luthar: Thanks, Juan. Slide 6, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered exceptional results in a dynamic market. Ag Services results more than doubled versus the year ago quarter. Global trade had an outstanding quarter. The destination marketing team's ability to meet customer demand around the globe helped drive strong volumes and margins. And good execution in global freight as well as net timing gains of about $65 million for the quarter contributed to significantly higher year-over-year profits. North America had a solid performance as export volumes remained strong in a good global demand environment, though year-over-year results were lower due to the prior year's insurance settlement and strong positioning gains. South America results were higher based on stronger origination volumes and better margins driven by strong global grain demand. Crushing delivered substantially higher results. Strong soy crush margins drove improved performance in all 3 regions as meal and oil demand remained robust. Positive net timing effects of approximately $90 million for the quarter versus the $70 million of negative timing in the year ago period helped drive year-over-year results. Refined products and other results were similar to the prior year period as strong demand for biofuels and food oils drove refining premiums and biodiesel margins, offset by approximately $150 million of negative timing effects versus negative $30 million in the prior year quarter. Equity earnings from Wilmar were significantly higher versus the second quarter of 2021. Looking ahead for AS&O. We expect Q3, the seasonal transition quarter from the South American to the North American harvest, to deliver results significantly higher than the prior year period driven by continued strong global demand for grains and strong cash -- crush margins. Slide 7, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team delivered a second quarter of extremely strong results. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much better results due to solid demand as food service volumes reached close to pre-pandemic levels. Corn coproducts, including strong demand for corn oil and effective risk management, drove higher ethanol and sweetener margins. BioSolutions continued its strong growth with $81 million in year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 and $136 million year-to-date. Vantage Corn Processors results was slightly higher in an environment of good gasoline demand and strong ethanol blending economics. A $50 million recovery from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program helped offset the prior year's strong industrial alcohol results from the now sold Peoria facility as well as valuation losses on ethanol inventory as prices fell late in the quarter. Looking ahead to the third quarter. We expect results significantly higher versus the third quarter of 2021 driven by steady demand for our products and favorable ethanol blending economics. On Slide 8, the Nutrition business continued on its strong growth trajectory with 19% year-over-year profit growth. Revenues increased by 20% on a constant currency basis and 13% like-for-like, and the team did a good job protecting margins. Human Nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results. Flavors grew revenue in North America, EMEA and South America, though profits were lower due to negative currency effects in EMEA as well as weaker results in APAC. Healthy demand for alternative proteins resulted in strong soy protein volumes and margins as contributions from the Sojaprotein acquisition as well as good demand for texturants drove higher results in Specialty Ingredients. Strength across probiotics, including in the recently acquired Deerland business as well as robust demand for fibers, contributed to a stronger quarter in Health & Wellness. Across the Human Nutrition business, we continue to see low price elasticity and good demand for our diverse portfolio of ingredients and systems as we continue to support our customers with new product and cost-out innovation and drive industry-leading win rates. Animal Nutrition profits were up substantially year-over-year driven by continued strong volumes and margins in amino acids. Looking ahead, we expect third quarter results for Nutrition to be higher year-over-year as the business remains on a trajectory to deliver 20% OP growth for the full year. Slide 9, please. Other business results increased from the prior year quarter driven primarily by higher ADM investor services earnings due to higher short-term interest rates. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $267 million was slightly higher year-over-year due primarily to higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher rates and higher short-term borrowings to support working capital needs as well as higher expense for long-term debt. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 18%. Based upon our current outlook, we expect full year corporate costs to trend towards $1.3 billion versus our previous outlook of about $1.2 billion, largely due to higher year-over-year interest rates. We still expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 19%. Next slide, please. Year-to-date operating cash flows before working capital of $3.2 billion are up significantly versus $2.2 billion at the same time last year. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 30% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion. Driven by our strong cash flows and robust earnings, we expect to accelerate our share repurchase program adding to the $200 million we repurchased in the second quarter of the year with an additional $1 billion in the back half. And of course, the strong cash flows and balance sheet also preserve our flexibility to continue reinvesting in the business and advancing upside growth opportunities. Our CapEx outlook is unchanged at approximately $1.3 billion for the year. Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vikram. Slide 11, please. For context as we discuss our outlook, I would like to go back to the goals and drivers we laid out at our Global Investor Day in December. We talked about the plan in which our strategic productivity and innovation actions will continue to build a better ADM and align our portfolio to meet accelerating structural demand changes driven by the enduring global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability and how that would drive a strong earnings trajectory over the plan horizon. What has transpired since then is that some of the market factors have reinforced and further enhanced the value proposition of our diverse product portfolio and our integrated global network of assets. This helps drive stronger-than-expected margins. So while we may see some reversion in the medium term, we now believe that margin structures are generally higher than when we have laid out in December. We are on a trajectory to deliver a very strong second half, resulting in expected full year earnings above $6.50 per share. And as Vikram said, the strong cash flows we are generating will enable us to accelerate the timing of our share repurchase program with $1 billion in repurchases in the back half of the year. As we look beyond that, we have not changed our strategy, nor our expectations of strong earnings growth and returns over our plan horizon. And as we laid out at our Global Investor Day, there are upside opportunities to our medium-term plan. But as we have already covered today, we are advancing those now and realizing higher value from them. Higher BioSolutions revenue growth, higher Health & Wellness OP contributions, the operational transformation across the enterprise, we expect these and more to add further upside in the medium term. The opportunities before us are significant. I'm proud of what our team has achieved, but I'm even more excited about what we're going to deliver tomorrow, next year and in the years to come. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator:  Our first question for today comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens.\nBenjamin Bienvenu : I want to ask one kind of bigger-picture conceptual question, and then my second question is more near term in nature. The first is on the accelerated share repurchase. I'd be curious to hear a little bit more about all of the decision points that flow into that bigger-picture decision. I would imagine -- you highlighted strong underlying fundamentals in the business. I imagine there's a component associated with working capital as well as some of that frees up with commodity markets cooling a bit. I'm curious also to get an update on your longer-term capacity expansion pipeline and how on schedule those build-outs are. And should we think of share repurchase as a lever to throttle up and pull back depending on M&A and CapEx timing of kind of long-lived capital investments? That's my first question.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. Thank you, Ben. Good question. We are maintaining our balanced capital allocation that we put together some years back. We always said that we're going to take about 30% to 40% of our free cash flow to reinvest in the business, and that's what our strategy of bolt-on and organic growth normally takes. And that will be the priority. We have exciting opportunities ahead of us. So we're going to prioritize our investment plan. But of course, we've been paying dividends for 90 years. We've been growing dividends for more than 40 years, and we will continue that. We increased dividends 8% this year. And when we're looking at our distribution, again, this 60% to 70%, whether there are strategic opportunities to do M&A or giving back to shareholders, as we said before, at this point in time, when valuations may be correcting and all that, we don't have any significant targets in front of us. Our team continue to look for bolt-ons. And given the significant strength of our cash flows, we have decided to honor that return of shareholder -- of funds to shareholders. So I would say we will maintain that balanced allocation. We are not -- in the plan when we presented in December, we were looking at the later part of the plan as we were approaching $6 to $7 per share that we will have ability to repurchase about $5 billion of that. Certainly, we will be, as I said in my initial remarks, north of $6.50 today. So some of those buybacks are accelerated to the scenario. So I would say it continues to be consistent in that regard. Is there a later part of the question I'm missing or forgetting? Oh, the capacity to increase, yes, organic capacity. Listen, we are -- as you can -- Vikram mentioned it, we are increasing our CapEx into $1.3 billion. And we've been accelerating some long lead equipment this year to make sure that our capacity expansions remain on schedule. So if we look at the big ones that we have right now, whether it's Spiritwood, it's still expected to be online by the harvest of 2023. We are expanding capacity in bioactives in Valencia. That's expected to come in the first quarter of 2023. That's also on schedule. So I would say, in general, across the globe, since we have the ability and the funds, we've been making sure that we eliminated that risk or we minimized that risk. Of course, there is always a risk of labor and labor is tight, especially in North America. But I think at this point in time, we don't have any major deviation to our plans.\nBenjamin Bienvenu: Okay. Great. My second question is related to the grappling of supply-demand that we're seeing right now. Obviously, there, you highlighted your expectation of structurally higher margins across your business. That makes sense given the kind of bigger-picture structural changes in demand that support the profitability of your business over the next several years. But we are starting to see demand destruction cyclically as the consumer deteriorates. I think your business is really well positioned. But I'm curious about kind of what you guys are keeping your eyes on relative to deteriorating underlying consumer and that -- the consequence of that rippling back up the supply chain -- the value chain potentially.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. Ben, listen, we're watching the demand, of course. We go -- we work very closely with our customers and our farmers on this. I would say we have seen demand substitution, demand shifting here or there. And you see it in retail, maybe to private label. We've seen a little bit to people looking into smaller packaging to make things more affordable. So I would say, if I think of the big categories for ADM, food tends to be, despite all these comments, much more reliable, much more stable in that -- just the essential nature of that. I think our fuels business, our biofuels business in general, are more tied to programs that are long term and to initiatives to reduce emissions and improve climate over the long term. So they also tend to be relatively firm, if you will. And we see that with RGD bringing new demand for oil. So if we have any issue in edible oils, it's certainly been more than offset by the new demand on renewables. And I will say the area where maybe we keep a closer look to all that is animal feed. Animal feed has been impacted by this. We estimate something in the range of maybe 10 million to 15 million tons on a global basis that maybe we took out of our SMBs from the globe perspective, not just from our own revenue, from the globe SMBs. I think we have seen less of an impact on an OP perspective because as people like to trade down, if you will, or if they were to trade down from beef, chicken is a cheaper protein. It's a more affordable protein. And chicken is where we get all the soybean meal mostly sourced. If you think about what's happening with soybean meal, is -- it has a cost advantage to corn. So it continues to have a high proportion in the Russians on things that are, if you will, more demanded right now like poultry. When we go to Nutrition, I think you said it in your -- in the question is we are well positioned in some of the applications that are growing the fastest, and of course, not completely insulated. To a certain degree, we haven't seen significant drops at this point in time. So our expansions and -- continue forward. And you saw in our remarks, our -- the acquisitions we made last year are actually performing from an OP perspective better than in the economic model we put together.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays.\nBenjamin Theurer : Good morning, Juan, Vikram. So my first question is also related a little bit to, the picture you draw and you laid out just about 7, 8 months ago during the Capital Markets Day back in December and you talked about the path to get to the $6 to $7. Now you're just at $6.50 for this year. But the one thing that kind of pops out is the significant strength and the up we've been seeing on the return on invested capital. And you still say your long-term objective is 10%, but now we've been consistently gone higher. So if we put it like into the context and your comments of the margin structure to remain higher, how should we think conceptually over the medium to long term? Where is your real ROIC objective given that you've been consistently above that 10% level? And what does that mean for your potential to return cash to shareholders via dividends, buybacks versus then ultimately the CapEx needs?\nVikram Luthar : Thanks, Ben, for the question. So just to give you some context, when we decided on the 10% ROIC target, it was based on an expectation of about 300 basis points above our long-term cost of capital. The long-term cost of capital has been around 7% for some time now. But as we look forward and we see interest rates on the rise, there is likelihood that over the medium term, the long-term WACC is going to increase. We still want to maintain our buffer or our spread versus that long-term WACC. So in short, yes, we are actually looking at growing our ROIC beyond the 10%. We haven't firmly established a new target. But clearly, as you've seen, we are well ahead of 10% on the back of a strong demand outlook for the medium term as well a strong discipline on the denominator from a balance sheet perspective. So in terms of the capital allocation and the forward outlook, Ben, I think it's consistent with what Juan said. We expect we are going to be very disciplined and balanced in terms of how we deploy that capital both in terms of reinvesting in the business. And by the way, the opportunities to reinvest in the business are significant. Juan mentioned some, including the operational transformation. And much of that is not even baked into the medium-term plan that we highlighted. So we anticipate there likely will be some additional reinvestment in the business, but that should still leave us enough flexibility to do share buyback, potentially even in excess of $5 billion as well as continue our pace of dividend growth as we've done historically over the last 40-plus years.\nBenjamin Theurer : Got it. That sounds very promising, Vikram. And then just coming back on the growth and what's being delivered within the Nutrition segment, just to kind of frame it and understand it well what you're seeing into the back half here because clearly, you kind of reconfirmed the 20-ish percent growth in op income. We've had a very strong first half. You expect next quarter to be better. Is there anything where you think there could be a little bit of a headwind in the more short term just because of people maybe down-trading on the consumption side? You mentioned a little bit maybe the packaging side going to smaller sizes, et cetera, but to understand a little bit the risks versus the opportunities within Nutrition.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. Ben, first of all, Nutrition is the business where we're probably exposed the most to the supply chain issues that everybody is talking about because we have a more variety of raw materials that we consume in all these formulations. So that is always something that the team works very well to overcome. But that's an issue we watch very closely. The second is, as you know, that business is also very strong in Europe. So there is a ForEx exposure that we keep on looking. And I mentioned at the beginning that Animal Nutrition volumes are a little bit more difficult, I think that given the price point where we are. So I would say those are the 3 levers that we keep on looking to make sure that we balance that. I would have to say the business has done a terrific job of offsetting all that. And again, we still believe in our enhanced guidance from 15% to 20% for this year. We're still going to do that. And the business, again, as I've said many, many times before, it's clearly in its path to achieve our $1 billion operating profit objective probably next year. So we feel good about the business, but it's not without a lot of active management, if you will. So...\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson : So I wanted to maybe dig into the outlook on oilseeds a little bit. In your prepared remarks, you alluded to a mid-cycle or normalized medium-term kind of margin structure that moves higher, and I'd love to get a little bit more color on how your view over the medium term has evolved there and especially in the context of a North American kind of industry that's in the midst of some pretty healthy capacity expansions by you and many others.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. Adam, listen, we continue to see a strong demand for meal and oil. North America has many advantages. North America has the beans, and North America has a robust domestic consumption. North America has the new demand for oil. So that makes, of course, soybean meal more competitive in the world. We continue to see good margins and good volumes in poultry as -- again, as the consumer favors that meat. We continue to see soybean meal advantage to corn. As I said before, in the Russian, that continues to have high inclusion rates. We see China recovering from COVID, so activity coming back. And we see Argentina pretty much given the current financial issues outside of the markets in terms of their aggressiveness. So I would say the scenario that we've been seeing, it continues with strength going forward. I think that's kind of what we see at the moment. So Q3 is strong. I would say maybe if I go to canola, canola has been -- margins have popped. So maybe we had -- we didn't have that in the past. Now we have, very strong. So we see a strong demand for biodiesel. I'm just trying to go mentally through all the businesses. And as we said before, Wilmar has been doing very good. So we don't see any significant clouds in the horizon right now. We have good expectations. We think that for the second half, the U.S. will become the place to export for corn and soybeans. So I think that exports should come to the U.S. from the period of September to maybe February or maybe even March. So we will have to watch logistics and whether logistics can allow us to execute a strong export season. But that's probably the only thing out there that I will be thinking, Adam, in terms of puts and takes.\nAdam Samuelson : Okay. That's all really helpful. And if I could maybe just switch gears over to Carbohydrate Solutions and specifically Starches and Sweeteners. I mean very strong kind of first half results. And I guess I'm trying to think about the contributions of between kind of volume growth, better ethanol profitability, coproducts and kind of -- and risk management and just that thing could be your most mature business and seeing some very, very healthy absolute and year-over-year performance and trying to just maybe disaggregate some of the drivers there a little bit.\nVikram Luthar : Yes. Sure. So Adam, just breaking it down into volume margin and mix. In Sweeteners and Starches, from a volume perspective, actually, we saw volumes in North America higher year-over-year in the first half. And that is different from what you may have heard generally in the marketplace. We clearly benefit from an integrated network that enables us to deliver to our customers effectively and efficiently. And in some cases, we've actually also imported tapioca starch, for example, from Europe to meet that demand. So volume has been strong. In terms of margin, clearly, we benefited from higher coproduct values, including corn oil in particular. So that's also helped in terms of the net corn and effective margins for Sweeteners and Starches. And from a mix perspective, we talked about BioSolutions driving more and more growth, higher than what we had anticipated. So on all 3 fronts, in terms of volume, margin and mix, S&S looks brighter than what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. In terms of ethanol also, if you think about similar way of thinking about volumes, volumes have been strong in terms of gasoline demand locally. Strong exports expected. We've had strong exports outlook for exports about 1.6 billion gallons for the year. In terms of margins, we've also again benefited from the fact that we've had good coproduct values particularly, again, in DCO. And that has helped us maintain margins. The other aspect is the RVOs have been finalized. So that puts -- removes the cloud from the regulatory landscape, at least for 2022. And gasoline -- and ethanol blending economics remain fantastic. If you include RIN values, that's above $2 relative to our BOB today. So I think based on all those facts, we think Q3 is going to be stronger quarter-over-quarter. And our outlook for the year is also very constructive.\nAdam Samuelson : Just to clarify, Vikram, because I don't think that was a nuance you said in the remarks. You said -- in the prepared remarks you said significantly higher year-over-year. And you're saying all of Carbohydrate Solutions will be higher quarter-over-quarter as well. I just want to be clear on that point.\nVikram Luthar : No. My comments were specifically quarter-over-quarter, significantly higher quarter-over-quarter for Q3. And what I just emphasized as well, we are constructive for the outlook for the full year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.\nKenneth Zaslow : Just a couple of questions. One is, how much dollar amount do you expect to increase in 2023 from your cost your harvesting of your growth investments? How do we kind of think about that for 2023 in terms of the dollar amount that's going to be coming out from both your cost savings and your investments in growth?\nVikram Luthar : So I think, Ken, just providing context, going back to the Global Investor Day in terms of the framework, right, we talked about productivity and innovation driving about $1.1 billion in aggregate each. And then we expected market forces should be about $1 billion. In terms of 2023, we haven't gone through the specific plan yet, right? We are still working through that. But you could assume kind of a flat line, roughly speaking, over that 4-year time frame. What I would submit to you, Ken, is over the last 3 or 4 months, as Juan mentioned, we see additional opportunities on the horizon as it relates to operational transformation with digitization and automation. We talked about the Marshall example. If we multiply that Marshall example, the upside could be even more. But that's something that we are still fleshing out, and we will be prepared in the foreseen quarters to provide you a little more granularity on that. Juan?\nJuan Luciano : Yes. Ken, what I would like to add to what Vikram said is that if I think back to December, there are 2 things that are different. A lot of the productivity efforts this year have been used to offset inflation, and I think the team has done a terrific job of protecting margins in that sense. Those productivity efforts continue. And as inflation may be received next year, we might see that -- more of that coming to actually improve our productivity versus just offsetting inflation. The second thing that I noticed and I tried to make a point in my prepared remarks is that we probably see innovation -- a little bit more activity in innovation. I think that as customers are trying to fight inflation, I think that bringing newness, bringing new categories, new innovation, we've seen that in Nutrition and other pieces of the portfolio. So I think there is an opportunity there. And some of the things that were not included in our 5-year estimate, whether it was some of the growth on Health and Wellness or some of the BioSolutions opportunities and all that, are coming stronger and faster than maybe we anticipated. So Vikram said it, we normally start the planning season maybe late September or October. So we're going to be looking at '23 there. But I think we're going to have a lot of puts and takes on a scenario that is very dynamic. But we feel good about the initiatives we can control, let's say.\nKenneth Zaslow : Great. Just a clarification question. You talked about the $6.50 number. That includes share repurchases. Is that -- does that -- but yes, underlying fundamentals seem stronger than maybe you expected. Can you reconcile that? Because if it includes the share repurchase, I would argue that maybe better than that. I don't know if you're being conservative, but I'm not trying to pinpoint you. Just there was some incongruence in terms of the accelerated share repurchase and just kind of sticking to that $6.50 number. Just wanted to touch base with that -- touch base on that, if you could help us out on that.\nVikram Luthar : Yes. So Ken, just to be clear, we did not say an ASR. We did not say accelerated share repurchase, right? I want to make sure that we clarify that comment. We did say that we are going to do $1 billion in the back half of the year. And as you well know is EPS impact of that given the averaging is pretty minimized for this calendar year. So the impact, whether you consider a share repurchase in the $6.50 number or not is frankly insignificant for 2022.\nKenneth Zaslow : Okay. So just putting this all together, even as fundamentals kind of stabilize at this higher level, your share repurchases, your productivity and your growth initiatives can propel earnings higher in 2023 even if fundamentals kind of stabilize and not -- not to say we're peaking, I don't want to use that word, but if we stabilize at a higher level. Is that fair way to think about it that your interim actions of those 3 components can drive earnings growth in 2023? And I'll leave it there and I appreciate your time as always.\nJuan Luciano : Ken, the way I think about it, let me share that, is we need to have in ADM certain ambidexterity. On one side, we have a team that executed on opportunities presented by the market. And the team is executing on great opportunities this year. We don't control that all the time. We control our execution, but we don't control the opportunities that pop based on the macro environment. On the other hand, we are committed to keep improving the company. So -- and that's what we committed in December over the 5-year plan. So to the extent that those forces, whether favorable or negative, offset our productivity and innovation, at times, we're going to see more of that effect and at times, we're going to see less. So we know we're going to grow earnings over the next 5 years based on all that. We have not gotten to 2023 at this point in time. So I want to make sure that people don't hear that what we're going to do is a promise to grow earnings every year. We cannot control all the environment in the world, but we can control that we get better and we can control that we can maximize our execution on the opportunities provided. Will 2023 provide the same opportunities of 2022? Unclear at this point in time, and we need to go through our scenarios. But I think we're going to feel -- we feel very good, as I said, on the team's ability to execute. Some of the macro that we're seeing in terms of demand, demand for food has been growing over the last 15 years at 1.8% per year. You can argue that at times, we are getting to the peak of arable land being brought into production; that at times, we are hitting the peak of maybe even yield in the area. So we think that although margins may not stay at this level, if they're going to stabilize, they're going to stabilize at higher level than in the past. And that's where we based our forecast in December, and we are maintaining that. So we feel good about continue to grow earnings. We haven't gotten to the specific 2023 number yet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne : Vikram, you had some constructive comments about third quarter for Ag Solutions and Oilseeds. And I wanted to specifically ask you about which of those 2 big businesses is primarily driving that favorable outlook. And in Ag Services, what is it? What regions of the world? Where do you see that strength coming from? And then one more for you on that. And if there is less crop production in the world in 2022 just from significantly less fertilizer applications, is that positive or net negative for you? You could have tighter supplies but less volume.\nVikram Luthar : Yes. So thanks for the question, Steve. In terms of AS&O, I'll break it up. In terms of AS, we talked about destination marketing being very strong, right? So that's part of global trading. We anticipate that to remain strong given our ability to deliver to customers around the globe. And actually, we have the globally integrated network we have enables us to do that very effectively and efficiently. So we believe that's going to be a continued contributor of the growth. You think about also where we are positioned as a company in North America and South America. Where is the world likely going to come for grain in the back half of this year? It's probably going to be in North America. And with a reasonable crop that we expect right now, we should be well positioned to be able to benefit from that given our footprint. So I think the strength in destination marketing within global trade as well as our asset footprint and the dearth of grain around the globe in light of what's happened gives us good flexibility and constructive margin outlook for the back half. On the Oilseeds side, the fundamentals remain strong. I mean you've seen that the demand for oil both on the food side as well as RGD remains strong. So North American crush margins should be constructive. As soybean meal remains a very efficient and cost-effective protein substitute for even wheat as wheat prices, even though they've come up, they're still relatively expensive. So soybean meal remains an important feed for all types of protein and especially for poultry, and you've seen the number of poultry rising. So we're constructive for crush margins in North America. And even with biodiesel as well, that's also providing another avenue to support crush margins even in Europe. So crush margin outlook for the back half is strong in terms of the fundamentals that I highlighted. So candidly, the strength in AS&O is both on AS, as well as O for the back half of this year.\nSteve Byrne : And you made a comment on one of the slides about investing in this sustainable agriculture initiative of FBN. My question for you on that is, how meaningful of an opportunity do you think this is for you? Are your food company customers willing to pay a premium to you, and thus the farmer, for grains and oilseeds that are produced in various sustainable ways? Is this a niche? Or is this a potentially meaningful portion of your origination business?\nJuan Luciano : Yes. Steve, this is Juan. We are building this. I think we have a division now within the business to look at these certified grains, if you will, or differentiated grains. There is certainly a consumer push into this that we feel through the CPGs and having the desire to engage in these transactions with us. So it continues to build. I don't think it's going to be meaningful to our earnings over the next 2, 3 years, but it's something that is aligned with sustainability trends. It's aligned with the ability of the whole industry to decarbonize and become better. So it makes us more sustainable. But it is growing. It's still small, but it continues to accelerate. So I don't think you should expect an OP impact over the next 2 years, but we're building a good position here. And with partners like FBN and all that, we continue to improve the economics and simplify the recognition to farmers as they embrace sustainable practices. So there is an economic motive or result later on, maybe in the planning cycle. At this point in time, it's more a sustainability thing that we do to help our customers as they need more of this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan.\nTom Palmer : Maybe I'll just start off on the crushing side. Margin info in the earnings presentation was encouraging as was your second half commentary. At the same time, we saw Board Crush at least temporarily weaken going back a month or 2. So it looks like it hasn't carried forward in terms of Board Crush or in spot as much but -- and nor have much bearing on third quarter results, but I hope to get at least a little bit of color on what happened and why the impact was so temporary?\nJuan Luciano : Yes. I think, Tom, what we saw -- of course, base has become -- became a little bit tighter in the U.S. and so, and we saw a little bit of palm oil correction that maybe impacted some of the oil. So you get board compress a little bit. In reality, the cash markets have never moved, and they remain very constructive and very strong. And now you have seen how Board Crush have bounced back. I think that what we need to remember is like before all this volatility, whether it's the war or this or that, we were coming into very strong markets. Again, demand continues to grow for meal. And now we have another leg of that, that has a new demand. And mature markets like this, when they get new demand in a significant quantity like RGD, you get a significant change in margin. When you think about the structural changes that have happened over time, whether it's the different way in which China feeds porks now or Argentina with an exchange rate delta that makes the farmer really have no desire to sell and the farmer, to a certain degree, curtailing crush in Argentina. And then we see China coming back from the lockdowns and soybean meal being better than corn into the Russian, we continue to see this strong. Now we have also canola helping onto this on the strength in biofuels, in biodiesel per se. So I think from our perspective, we were always looking at cash margins. And so we -- it didn't make a significant shift in our operating profit as we were saying in the last earnings call, to be honest. So it has moved and at times some of these moves, to be honest, in commodities has been driven more by financial flows than fundamentals. I would say the fundamentals were strong before the war. They continue to be strong. Some prices have spiked because of the war, then they came back, but they came back to the high levels that we had before the war because it was just supply-demand fundamentals. And as much as people talk about rising interest rates and all that, rising interest rates do not produce grain. So we have not seen any change in our supply-demand fundamentals that were in place before the war, before the tightening by the Fed. So to a certain degree, we need to keep our eyes on the fundamentals. That's what matters.\nTom Palmer : That's very helpful color. Maybe I'll just follow up on the soybean oil side. There's a lot of renewable diesel capacity scheduled to come online later this year. What are you seeing in terms of that demand environment? Are you starting to see inventories build to essentially new customers? Because the soybean curve at least is downward sloping and it does seem like there's a lot more demand to step up that could at least theoretically change that.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. Listen, I think we're building new industries. So there are so many players here and so many things in motion. It's a very dynamic environment that we continue to watch. I think with -- we see the demand coming as expected. I think you may have, like in every capital project these days, some projects that may be a little bit delayed. But we don't see any significant change to our medium-term forecast. So we see the strength. We see the recovery on even potentially edible oils based on China coming back into the markets and coming back from lockdowns. So none of our forecast has changed in the oil side. And if you look at the contribution of meal and oil to crush from the last quarter to this quarter, it has maintained. So it looks like both legs continue to have the same strength at this point than we expected.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Larson of Seaport Research Partners.\nEric Larson : Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a great quarter. So this maybe some kind of like a little bit of a corny question Juan in this very 30,000-foot kind of speaking level. In the past, there's no promise that aren't long enough. When you have global recession, it does change the fundamentals for grain demand. And I get the question all the time. My sense is so that there are enough structural changes, particularly in the U.S. market, where even if we did have a global recession is that the fundamentals have a reasonable chance of remaining fairly strong. Is that an off-base thought? Or how would you look at that?\nJuan Luciano : Yes. As I was saying in the previous question, I think that, again, before rising rates that could drive into a slowdown of the economy or the war, we had a tight balance sheet. I mean, Eric, and you want to keep it at 30,000 feet. We're going to run this experiment of trying to feed 2 more billion people from here to 2050, something that we haven't done in the past. And as I said, you could argue that if we're going to move population from 7 billion to like 9.5 billion by 2050, there's not the same proportion of arable land are going to be brought into production nor the same proportion of yield going to be. So I think in recessions, food is more protected than other things. So we don't expect a significant drop in demand, at least not for a sustainable period of time. While the reality is that production may or may not be there when you think about weather, when you think about the limitations of acreage or the limitations of potential yield. So our scenario is for tightness going forward. And we will do our best to make sure we continue to supply the billions of people around the world with their needs. But I think it's more prudent to plan on a tight supply-demand scenario. And at this point in time, when we run the supply-demand going a little bit more shorter term, we think that at least we need to have 2 very good years of good crops in North America and South America to bring a little bit more of relief to the current supply-demand inventories. Even if we have a good growth in North America, I don't think we're going to increase pipeline from -- for soybeans at this point in time. So South America has been with La Ni\u00c3\u00b1a for like 3 years or something like that. So some of these events are starting to last a little bit longer. Thankfully, in North America, everything looks like we're still going to have another good year. So we welcome the end of the harvest to see a very good crop this year in North America.\nEric Larson : Yes. No, I would agree with that. So I'll ask one more quick question, and it's more technical in nature. So in the quarter, you put over $3 billion on top of your inventories. And I'm just curious when you look at where grain prices were on March 31 versus June 30, June 30 you were down across the board, corn, beans, meal, oil, wheat, all the prices were down. So does that mean that you've just taken on -- you've been able to buy more grain, taken on bigger positions so your volume inventory is larger? Does that explain that $3 billion-plus of inventory increase?\nVikram Luthar : Well, I think the inventory, when you're talking about us, I think our working capital effectively from Q1 to Q2 has come down a bit, Eric. So I think it's a function of both volumes as well as prices. Yes, prices have come off. But I think it's a function of also what's happening around the globe. You've got to think about not just our Ag Services and Oilseeds business. You got to think about also the other parts of our business. So while in general, there is a correlation to prices, there's also not necessarily same flat volume across every quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley.\nSteven Haynes : I just wanted to ask a question on China. It's come up a few times. Maybe could you just go into a little bit more detail around demand dynamics there? I think soybean imports are still kind of trending down year-over-year. So are we kind of at an inflection point there? And any additional color would be great.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. We think -- we are in close contact with our China team, of course. And I think demand there has, of course, suffered an impact. You saw their quarterly growth rate for the whole country. But we get encouraging reports of how activity is coming back. I think that at the beginning, even if they relieved on some of the restrictions, people were still a little bit shy to come out. But I think that now we're seeing people coming back to the office, were a 100% back into the office. That brings traffic and that brings external breakfast and external lunches and things like that. So we see that with a recovery, if you will, coming from our perspective. If you think about the 4 main meats for China, China has produced about 5% more of the combined 4 meats in the first half of the year. So you could see there that, of course, the mouths are still there to be fed. And certainly, food security continues to be a high priority of, of course, the very responsible Chinese government. So nothing significant to report other than the ease of the COVID situation that is happening in multiple cities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, Juan and Vikram. Juan, forgive me if you've addressed this already, but there's a lot of grain still trapped in Ukraine. And I want to know if you have a view on what's going to happen to it and how it will affect your business.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. So thank you for the question on Ukraine. So our priorities in the company, Rob, as we have said it before, continue to be twofold. First is to provide for the support and well-being of our employees now and into the future. But the second very close priority, what you described, is that how do we help the industry in Ukraine, the agricultural industry to come back on their feet? As you know, there are 20 million, 30 million tons trapped there. And we've been working to increase the land exports and I think even some of the river exports. And so we're very proud of what the whole industry has done to increase those. We're still short of that. And of course, that's why you see both countries signing this Black Sea initiative, which is to allow Odessa and other ports there to come back to full capacity to be able to export. At this point in time, as you have read the news, you get encouraging news 1 day and maybe discouraging news the other day. I do believe that both countries are committed to help keep this corridor open. I think that at the beginning, you're going to see a little bit of a trickle down of exports, maybe smaller boats. I think it's going to take a little bit of building confidence that this works before you can put the bigger boats. There are issues in the country about getting fuel for that. There are issues in the country about getting the crews to man this boat. There are also issues about insurance and financial institutions guaranteeing some of these large transactions. So I think I'm optimistic. I think you're going to have a trickle-down. That will be good for all for us and for everybody that we allow that capacity not to be unutilized, if you will. At this point in time, the world need to access to those inventories. So this is an important thing. If we don't have access to those inventories and they are not clear from the storage next year, we may have an availability issue for food because we will lose part of the crop. Ukrainians apparently have done a very good job of planting about 70% of all the capacity -- all the area, and they are harvesting right now the wheat. They're going to be harvesting in September and October, the corn and the sun seed. So we need that space to be able to store those in September and October. So we are optimistic. We are helping as much as possible. There is a lot of people with good intention. So hopefully, we will see the sea exports to grow over the next 2 or 3 months.\nOperator: Our final question for today comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.\nMichael Piken : A couple of parts on Nutrition. The first part being within Human Nutrition, how much of your revenue growth was with new customers versus expansion of current customers? And then on the Animal Nutrition side, how much of the growth was due to the favorability of the lysine market versus just internal operational improvements? And how sustainable is that?\nVikram Luthar : On the Human Nutrition side, it was a balanced growth across new customers as well as existing customers. And we think about our revenue growth in terms of volume, pricing and mix, right? So I think we had balanced growth across the 3. We drove early action on pricing to ensure that we maintain margins and kept a strong focus on driving mix. Price elasticity for some of the products -- or most of the products, frankly, we participate in Human Nutrition has tended to be pretty low as Juan noted. So I think that's helped benefit protecting margins as well as driving revenue growth. On the Animal Nutrition side, as I highlighted in my prepared comments, most of that growth has come from amino acids, and amino acids has benefited from, a, the relative protein demand as well as supply chain challenges out of China. And the third aspect that's benefited us is our conscious effort to switch from liquid lysine to dry lysine and that's -- sorry, so from dry lysine to liquid lysine, yes. And that's actually helped us drive improved profitability and improved margins as well as increase stickiness with our customers. So most of that volume growth in Animal Nutrition has been driven by amino acids.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions for today, so I will hand back to Michael Cross for any further remarks.\nMichael Cross: Thank you for joining us today. Slide 12 notes upcoming investor events in which we will be participating. As always, please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day, and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. This morning, we reported outstanding second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.15. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.8 billion, and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA approached $6 billion. And our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 11.6%. Our team executed extremely well in the second quarter, navigating dynamic conditions to deliver nutritions to billions. And even as we work tirelessly to serve our customers and consumers around the globe, we are continuing to advance our strategy with productivity initiatives that are improving our efficiency and cost structure and innovation work that is powering profitable growth. Slide 4, please. Productivity is how we are improving our execution and optimizing costs, is key to our long term success but equally and importantly our productivity work is helping us mitigate the impact of inflation. We have a very strong pipeline of productivity initiatives and I will be updating you on them regularly. There are 2 initiatives I'd like to highlight today. First is a set of operational transformation efforts we are driving across production facilities around the globe and spanning all 3 businesses. Earlier this year, we completed a modernization project in our Marshall, Minnesota corn facility that is unlocking significant new value through enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics. We're already seeing double-digit returns on the investment we made in that project. This is an example of the kinds of projects we're undertaking across our operational footprint, designed to unlock incremental volumes and deliver safer, more reliable, more cost-efficient operations. Second, as we look to continue to grow returns, we want to focus not only on the numerator but also the denominator. Our original $1 billion challenge and its follow-up, the next billion, help us drive to 10% ROIC. Earlier this year, we launched a new challenge aimed at monetizing assets and optimizing working capital to unlock another $1 billion in cash, helping us to continue to drive returns. In fact, we already realized more than $400 million. Next slide, please. We're also advancing our innovation pillar, fueling profitable growth as we continue to expand our capabilities to meet demand across the 3 global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. For example, last November, we added significant new capabilities in our Health and Wellness business with the acquisition of Deerland Probiotics. Demand in the human microbiome space is expected to reach $9.1 billion by 2026. While in animal feed, probiotic demand is expected to grow to $6.2 billion. Deerland with a broad portfolio of probiotics, prebiotics and enzymes provides a wide array of commercial, R&D and operations-related synergy opportunities to help us meet that demand. And we're taking advantage of those opportunities from connecting our deal and capabilities with our Biopolis team in Spain to utilize sport probiotics in a functional chocolate bar; to bringing together our expertise to expand our capabilities in pet, a key growth category; to looking across teams to offer new types of dietary supplements. Thanks to the strong collaboration across the enterprise, Deerland today is increasing our share of wallet for customers in both human and pet solutions. And we're seeing similar outcomes from other recent investments as well. In the first half of the year, our combined portfolio of 2021 nutrition acquisitions has delivered significantly more OP than we had in our acquisition models. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram? Thank you, Vikram. Slide 11, please. For context as we discuss our outlook, I would like to go back to the goals and drivers we laid out at our Global Investor Day in December. We talked about the plan in which our strategic productivity and innovation actions will continue to build a better ADM and align our portfolio to meet accelerating structural demand changes driven by the enduring global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability and how that would drive a strong earnings trajectory over the plan horizon. What has transpired since then is that some of the market factors have reinforced and further enhanced the value proposition of our diverse product portfolio and our integrated global network of assets. This helps drive stronger-than-expected margins. So while we may see some reversion in the medium term, we now believe that margin structures are generally higher than when we have laid out in December. We are on a trajectory to deliver a very strong second half, resulting in expected full year earnings above $6.50 per share. And as Vikram said, the strong cash flows we are generating will enable us to accelerate the timing of our share repurchase program with $1 billion in repurchases in the back half of the year. As we look beyond that, we have not changed our strategy, nor our expectations of strong earnings growth and returns over our plan horizon. And as we laid out at our Global Investor Day, there are upside opportunities to our medium-term plan. But as we have already covered today, we are advancing those now and realizing higher value from them. Higher BioSolutions revenue growth, higher Health & Wellness OP contributions, the operational transformation across the enterprise, we expect these and more to add further upside in the medium term. The opportunities before us are significant. I'm proud of what our team has achieved, but I'm even more excited about what we're going to deliver tomorrow, next year and in the years to come. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Thank you, Ben. Good question. We are maintaining our balanced capital allocation that we put together some years back. We always said that we're going to take about 30% to 40% of our free cash flow to reinvest in the business, and that's what our strategy of bolt-on and organic growth normally takes. And that will be the priority. We have exciting opportunities ahead of us. So we're going to prioritize our investment plan. But of course, we've been paying dividends for 90 years. We've been growing dividends for more than 40 years, and we will continue that. We increased dividends 8% this year. And when we're looking at our distribution, again, this 60% to 70%, whether there are strategic opportunities to do M&A or giving back to shareholders, as we said before, at this point in time, when valuations may be correcting and all that, we don't have any significant targets in front of us. Our team continue to look for bolt-ons. And given the significant strength of our cash flows, we have decided to honor that return of shareholder -- of funds to shareholders. So I would say we will maintain that balanced allocation. We are not -- in the plan when we presented in December, we were looking at the later part of the plan as we were approaching $6 to $7 per share that we will have ability to repurchase about $5 billion of that. Certainly, we will be, as I said in my initial remarks, north of $6.50 today. So some of those buybacks are accelerated to the scenario. So I would say it continues to be consistent in that regard. Is there a later part of the question I'm missing or forgetting? Oh, the capacity to increase, yes, organic capacity. Listen, we are -- as you can -- Vikram mentioned it, we are increasing our CapEx into $1.3 billion. And we've been accelerating some long lead equipment this year to make sure that our capacity expansions remain on schedule. So if we look at the big ones that we have right now, whether it's Spiritwood, it's still expected to be online by the harvest of 2023. We are expanding capacity in bioactives in Valencia. That's expected to come in the first quarter of 2023. That's also on schedule. So I would say, in general, across the globe, since we have the ability and the funds, we've been making sure that we eliminated that risk or we minimized that risk. Of course, there is always a risk of labor and labor is tight, especially in North America. But I think at this point in time, we don't have any major deviation to our plans. Yes. Ben, listen, we're watching the demand, of course. We go -- we work very closely with our customers and our farmers on this. I would say we have seen demand substitution, demand shifting here or there. And you see it in retail, maybe to private label. We've seen a little bit to people looking into smaller packaging to make things more affordable. So I would say, if I think of the big categories for ADM, food tends to be, despite all these comments, much more reliable, much more stable in that -- just the essential nature of that. I think our fuels business, our biofuels business in general, are more tied to programs that are long term and to initiatives to reduce emissions and improve climate over the long term. So they also tend to be relatively firm, if you will. And we see that with RGD bringing new demand for oil. So if we have any issue in edible oils, it's certainly been more than offset by the new demand on renewables. And I will say the area where maybe we keep a closer look to all that is animal feed. Animal feed has been impacted by this. We estimate something in the range of maybe 10 million to 15 million tons on a global basis that maybe we took out of our SMBs from the globe perspective, not just from our own revenue, from the globe SMBs. I think we have seen less of an impact on an OP perspective because as people like to trade down, if you will, or if they were to trade down from beef, chicken is a cheaper protein. It's a more affordable protein. And chicken is where we get all the soybean meal mostly sourced. If you think about what's happening with soybean meal, is -- it has a cost advantage to corn. So it continues to have a high proportion in the Russians on things that are, if you will, more demanded right now like poultry. When we go to Nutrition, I think you said it in your -- in the question is we are well positioned in some of the applications that are growing the fastest, and of course, not completely insulated. To a certain degree, we haven't seen significant drops at this point in time. So our expansions and -- continue forward. And you saw in our remarks, our -- the acquisitions we made last year are actually performing from an OP perspective better than in the economic model we put together. Yes. Ben, first of all, Nutrition is the business where we're probably exposed the most to the supply chain issues that everybody is talking about because we have a more variety of raw materials that we consume in all these formulations. So that is always something that the team works very well to overcome. But that's an issue we watch very closely. The second is, as you know, that business is also very strong in Europe. So there is a ForEx exposure that we keep on looking. And I mentioned at the beginning that Animal Nutrition volumes are a little bit more difficult, I think that given the price point where we are. So I would say those are the 3 levers that we keep on looking to make sure that we balance that. I would have to say the business has done a terrific job of offsetting all that. And again, we still believe in our enhanced guidance from 15% to 20% for this year. We're still going to do that. And the business, again, as I've said many, many times before, it's clearly in its path to achieve our $1 billion operating profit objective probably next year. So we feel good about the business, but it's not without a lot of active management, if you will. So... Yes. Adam, listen, we continue to see a strong demand for meal and oil. North America has many advantages. North America has the beans, and North America has a robust domestic consumption. North America has the new demand for oil. So that makes, of course, soybean meal more competitive in the world. We continue to see good margins and good volumes in poultry as -- again, as the consumer favors that meat. We continue to see soybean meal advantage to corn. As I said before, in the Russian, that continues to have high inclusion rates. We see China recovering from COVID, so activity coming back. And we see Argentina pretty much given the current financial issues outside of the markets in terms of their aggressiveness. So I would say the scenario that we've been seeing, it continues with strength going forward. I think that's kind of what we see at the moment. So Q3 is strong. I would say maybe if I go to canola, canola has been -- margins have popped. So maybe we had -- we didn't have that in the past. Now we have, very strong. So we see a strong demand for biodiesel. I'm just trying to go mentally through all the businesses. And as we said before, Wilmar has been doing very good. So we don't see any significant clouds in the horizon right now. We have good expectations. We think that for the second half, the U.S. will become the place to export for corn and soybeans. So I think that exports should come to the U.S. from the period of September to maybe February or maybe even March. So we will have to watch logistics and whether logistics can allow us to execute a strong export season. But that's probably the only thing out there that I will be thinking, Adam, in terms of puts and takes. Yes. Ken, what I would like to add to what Vikram said is that if I think back to December, there are 2 things that are different. A lot of the productivity efforts this year have been used to offset inflation, and I think the team has done a terrific job of protecting margins in that sense. Those productivity efforts continue. And as inflation may be received next year, we might see that -- more of that coming to actually improve our productivity versus just offsetting inflation. The second thing that I noticed and I tried to make a point in my prepared remarks is that we probably see innovation -- a little bit more activity in innovation. I think that as customers are trying to fight inflation, I think that bringing newness, bringing new categories, new innovation, we've seen that in Nutrition and other pieces of the portfolio. So I think there is an opportunity there. And some of the things that were not included in our 5-year estimate, whether it was some of the growth on Health and Wellness or some of the BioSolutions opportunities and all that, are coming stronger and faster than maybe we anticipated. So Vikram said it, we normally start the planning season maybe late September or October. So we're going to be looking at '23 there. But I think we're going to have a lot of puts and takes on a scenario that is very dynamic. But we feel good about the initiatives we can control, let's say. Ken, the way I think about it, let me share that, is we need to have in ADM certain ambidexterity. On one side, we have a team that executed on opportunities presented by the market. And the team is executing on great opportunities this year. We don't control that all the time. We control our execution, but we don't control the opportunities that pop based on the macro environment. On the other hand, we are committed to keep improving the company. So -- and that's what we committed in December over the 5-year plan. So to the extent that those forces, whether favorable or negative, offset our productivity and innovation, at times, we're going to see more of that effect and at times, we're going to see less. So we know we're going to grow earnings over the next 5 years based on all that. We have not gotten to 2023 at this point in time. So I want to make sure that people don't hear that what we're going to do is a promise to grow earnings every year. We cannot control all the environment in the world, but we can control that we get better and we can control that we can maximize our execution on the opportunities provided. Will 2023 provide the same opportunities of 2022? Unclear at this point in time, and we need to go through our scenarios. But I think we're going to feel -- we feel very good, as I said, on the team's ability to execute. Some of the macro that we're seeing in terms of demand, demand for food has been growing over the last 15 years at 1.8% per year. You can argue that at times, we are getting to the peak of arable land being brought into production; that at times, we are hitting the peak of maybe even yield in the area. So we think that although margins may not stay at this level, if they're going to stabilize, they're going to stabilize at higher level than in the past. And that's where we based our forecast in December, and we are maintaining that. So we feel good about continue to grow earnings. We haven't gotten to the specific 2023 number yet. Yes. Steve, this is Juan. We are building this. I think we have a division now within the business to look at these certified grains, if you will, or differentiated grains. There is certainly a consumer push into this that we feel through the CPGs and having the desire to engage in these transactions with us. So it continues to build. I don't think it's going to be meaningful to our earnings over the next 2, 3 years, but it's something that is aligned with sustainability trends. It's aligned with the ability of the whole industry to decarbonize and become better. So it makes us more sustainable. But it is growing. It's still small, but it continues to accelerate. So I don't think you should expect an OP impact over the next 2 years, but we're building a good position here. And with partners like FBN and all that, we continue to improve the economics and simplify the recognition to farmers as they embrace sustainable practices. So there is an economic motive or result later on, maybe in the planning cycle. At this point in time, it's more a sustainability thing that we do to help our customers as they need more of this. Yes. I think, Tom, what we saw -- of course, base has become -- became a little bit tighter in the U.S. and so, and we saw a little bit of palm oil correction that maybe impacted some of the oil. So you get board compress a little bit. In reality, the cash markets have never moved, and they remain very constructive and very strong. And now you have seen how Board Crush have bounced back. I think that what we need to remember is like before all this volatility, whether it's the war or this or that, we were coming into very strong markets. Again, demand continues to grow for meal. And now we have another leg of that, that has a new demand. And mature markets like this, when they get new demand in a significant quantity like RGD, you get a significant change in margin. When you think about the structural changes that have happened over time, whether it's the different way in which China feeds porks now or Argentina with an exchange rate delta that makes the farmer really have no desire to sell and the farmer, to a certain degree, curtailing crush in Argentina. And then we see China coming back from the lockdowns and soybean meal being better than corn into the Russian, we continue to see this strong. Now we have also canola helping onto this on the strength in biofuels, in biodiesel per se. So I think from our perspective, we were always looking at cash margins. And so we -- it didn't make a significant shift in our operating profit as we were saying in the last earnings call, to be honest. So it has moved and at times some of these moves, to be honest, in commodities has been driven more by financial flows than fundamentals. I would say the fundamentals were strong before the war. They continue to be strong. Some prices have spiked because of the war, then they came back, but they came back to the high levels that we had before the war because it was just supply-demand fundamentals. And as much as people talk about rising interest rates and all that, rising interest rates do not produce grain. So we have not seen any change in our supply-demand fundamentals that were in place before the war, before the tightening by the Fed. So to a certain degree, we need to keep our eyes on the fundamentals. That's what matters. Yes. Listen, I think we're building new industries. So there are so many players here and so many things in motion. It's a very dynamic environment that we continue to watch. I think with -- we see the demand coming as expected. I think you may have, like in every capital project these days, some projects that may be a little bit delayed. But we don't see any significant change to our medium-term forecast. So we see the strength. We see the recovery on even potentially edible oils based on China coming back into the markets and coming back from lockdowns. So none of our forecast has changed in the oil side. And if you look at the contribution of meal and oil to crush from the last quarter to this quarter, it has maintained. So it looks like both legs continue to have the same strength at this point than we expected. Yes. As I was saying in the previous question, I think that, again, before rising rates that could drive into a slowdown of the economy or the war, we had a tight balance sheet. I mean, Eric, and you want to keep it at 30,000 feet. We're going to run this experiment of trying to feed 2 more billion people from here to 2050, something that we haven't done in the past. And as I said, you could argue that if we're going to move population from 7 billion to like 9.5 billion by 2050, there's not the same proportion of arable land are going to be brought into production nor the same proportion of yield going to be. So I think in recessions, food is more protected than other things. So we don't expect a significant drop in demand, at least not for a sustainable period of time. While the reality is that production may or may not be there when you think about weather, when you think about the limitations of acreage or the limitations of potential yield. So our scenario is for tightness going forward. And we will do our best to make sure we continue to supply the billions of people around the world with their needs. But I think it's more prudent to plan on a tight supply-demand scenario. And at this point in time, when we run the supply-demand going a little bit more shorter term, we think that at least we need to have 2 very good years of good crops in North America and South America to bring a little bit more of relief to the current supply-demand inventories. Even if we have a good growth in North America, I don't think we're going to increase pipeline from -- for soybeans at this point in time. So South America has been with La NiA\u0303\u00b1a for like 3 years or something like that. So some of these events are starting to last a little bit longer. Thankfully, in North America, everything looks like we're still going to have another good year. So we welcome the end of the harvest to see a very good crop this year in North America. Yes. We think -- we are in close contact with our China team, of course. And I think demand there has, of course, suffered an impact. You saw their quarterly growth rate for the whole country. But we get encouraging reports of how activity is coming back. I think that at the beginning, even if they relieved on some of the restrictions, people were still a little bit shy to come out. But I think that now we're seeing people coming back to the office, were a 100% back into the office. That brings traffic and that brings external breakfast and external lunches and things like that. So we see that with a recovery, if you will, coming from our perspective. If you think about the 4 main meats for China, China has produced about 5% more of the combined 4 meats in the first half of the year. So you could see there that, of course, the mouths are still there to be fed. And certainly, food security continues to be a high priority of, of course, the very responsible Chinese government. So nothing significant to report other than the ease of the COVID situation that is happening in multiple cities. Yes. So thank you for the question on Ukraine. So our priorities in the company, Rob, as we have said it before, continue to be twofold. First is to provide for the support and well-being of our employees now and into the future. But the second very close priority, what you described, is that how do we help the industry in Ukraine, the agricultural industry to come back on their feet? As you know, there are 20 million, 30 million tons trapped there. And we've been working to increase the land exports and I think even some of the river exports. And so we're very proud of what the whole industry has done to increase those. We're still short of that. And of course, that's why you see both countries signing this Black Sea initiative, which is to allow Odessa and other ports there to come back to full capacity to be able to export. At this point in time, as you have read the news, you get encouraging news 1 day and maybe discouraging news the other day. I do believe that both countries are committed to help keep this corridor open. I think that at the beginning, you're going to see a little bit of a trickle down of exports, maybe smaller boats. I think it's going to take a little bit of building confidence that this works before you can put the bigger boats. There are issues in the country about getting fuel for that. There are issues in the country about getting the crews to man this boat. There are also issues about insurance and financial institutions guaranteeing some of these large transactions. So I think I'm optimistic. I think you're going to have a trickle-down. That will be good for all for us and for everybody that we allow that capacity not to be unutilized, if you will. At this point in time, the world need to access to those inventories. So this is an important thing. If we don't have access to those inventories and they are not clear from the storage next year, we may have an availability issue for food because we will lose part of the crop. Ukrainians apparently have done a very good job of planting about 70% of all the capacity -- all the area, and they are harvesting right now the wheat. They're going to be harvesting in September and October, the corn and the sun seed. So we need that space to be able to store those in September and October. So we are optimistic. We are helping as much as possible. There is a lot of people with good intention. So hopefully, we will see the sea exports to grow over the next 2 or 3 months."

            "content": "Thanks, Juan. Slide 6, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered exceptional results in a dynamic market. Ag Services results more than doubled versus the year ago quarter. Global trade had an outstanding quarter. The destination marketing team's ability to meet customer demand around the globe helped drive strong volumes and margins. And good execution in global freight as well as net timing gains of about $65 million for the quarter contributed to significantly higher year-over-year profits. North America had a solid performance as export volumes remained strong in a good global demand environment, though year-over-year results were lower due to the prior year's insurance settlement and strong positioning gains. South America results were higher based on stronger origination volumes and better margins driven by strong global grain demand. Crushing delivered substantially higher results. Strong soy crush margins drove improved performance in all 3 regions as meal and oil demand remained robust. Positive net timing effects of approximately $90 million for the quarter versus the $70 million of negative timing in the year ago period helped drive year-over-year results. Refined products and other results were similar to the prior year period as strong demand for biofuels and food oils drove refining premiums and biodiesel margins, offset by approximately $150 million of negative timing effects versus negative $30 million in the prior year quarter. Equity earnings from Wilmar were significantly higher versus the second quarter of 2021. Looking ahead for AS&O. We expect Q3, the seasonal transition quarter from the South American to the North American harvest, to deliver results significantly higher than the prior year period driven by continued strong global demand for grains and strong cash -- crush margins. Slide 7, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team delivered a second quarter of extremely strong results. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much better results due to solid demand as food service volumes reached close to pre-pandemic levels. Corn coproducts, including strong demand for corn oil and effective risk management, drove higher ethanol and sweetener margins. BioSolutions continued its strong growth with $81 million in year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 and $136 million year-to-date. Vantage Corn Processors results was slightly higher in an environment of good gasoline demand and strong ethanol blending economics. A $50 million recovery from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program helped offset the prior year's strong industrial alcohol results from the now sold Peoria facility as well as valuation losses on ethanol inventory as prices fell late in the quarter. Looking ahead to the third quarter. We expect results significantly higher versus the third quarter of 2021 driven by steady demand for our products and favorable ethanol blending economics. On Slide 8, the Nutrition business continued on its strong growth trajectory with 19% year-over-year profit growth. Revenues increased by 20% on a constant currency basis and 13% like-for-like, and the team did a good job protecting margins. Human Nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results. Flavors grew revenue in North America, EMEA and South America, though profits were lower due to negative currency effects in EMEA as well as weaker results in APAC. Healthy demand for alternative proteins resulted in strong soy protein volumes and margins as contributions from the Sojaprotein acquisition as well as good demand for texturants drove higher results in Specialty Ingredients. Strength across probiotics, including in the recently acquired Deerland business as well as robust demand for fibers, contributed to a stronger quarter in Health & Wellness. Across the Human Nutrition business, we continue to see low price elasticity and good demand for our diverse portfolio of ingredients and systems as we continue to support our customers with new product and cost-out innovation and drive industry-leading win rates. Animal Nutrition profits were up substantially year-over-year driven by continued strong volumes and margins in amino acids. Looking ahead, we expect third quarter results for Nutrition to be higher year-over-year as the business remains on a trajectory to deliver 20% OP growth for the full year. Slide 9, please. Other business results increased from the prior year quarter driven primarily by higher ADM investor services earnings due to higher short-term interest rates. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $267 million was slightly higher year-over-year due primarily to higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher rates and higher short-term borrowings to support working capital needs as well as higher expense for long-term debt. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 18%. Based upon our current outlook, we expect full year corporate costs to trend towards $1.3 billion versus our previous outlook of about $1.2 billion, largely due to higher year-over-year interest rates. We still expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 19%. Next slide, please. Year-to-date operating cash flows before working capital of $3.2 billion are up significantly versus $2.2 billion at the same time last year. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 30% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion. Driven by our strong cash flows and robust earnings, we expect to accelerate our share repurchase program adding to the $200 million we repurchased in the second quarter of the year with an additional $1 billion in the back half. And of course, the strong cash flows and balance sheet also preserve our flexibility to continue reinvesting in the business and advancing upside growth opportunities. Our CapEx outlook is unchanged at approximately $1.3 billion for the year. Juan? Thanks, Ben, for the question. So just to give you some context, when we decided on the 10% ROIC target, it was based on an expectation of about 300 basis points above our long-term cost of capital. The long-term cost of capital has been around 7% for some time now. But as we look forward and we see interest rates on the rise, there is likelihood that over the medium term, the long-term WACC is going to increase. We still want to maintain our buffer or our spread versus that long-term WACC. So in short, yes, we are actually looking at growing our ROIC beyond the 10%. We haven't firmly established a new target. But clearly, as you've seen, we are well ahead of 10% on the back of a strong demand outlook for the medium term as well a strong discipline on the denominator from a balance sheet perspective. So in terms of the capital allocation and the forward outlook, Ben, I think it's consistent with what Juan said. We expect we are going to be very disciplined and balanced in terms of how we deploy that capital both in terms of reinvesting in the business. And by the way, the opportunities to reinvest in the business are significant. Juan mentioned some, including the operational transformation. And much of that is not even baked into the medium-term plan that we highlighted. So we anticipate there likely will be some additional reinvestment in the business, but that should still leave us enough flexibility to do share buyback, potentially even in excess of $5 billion as well as continue our pace of dividend growth as we've done historically over the last 40-plus years. Yes. Sure. So Adam, just breaking it down into volume margin and mix. In Sweeteners and Starches, from a volume perspective, actually, we saw volumes in North America higher year-over-year in the first half. And that is different from what you may have heard generally in the marketplace. We clearly benefit from an integrated network that enables us to deliver to our customers effectively and efficiently. And in some cases, we've actually also imported tapioca starch, for example, from Europe to meet that demand. So volume has been strong. In terms of margin, clearly, we benefited from higher coproduct values, including corn oil in particular. So that's also helped in terms of the net corn and effective margins for Sweeteners and Starches. And from a mix perspective, we talked about BioSolutions driving more and more growth, higher than what we had anticipated. So on all 3 fronts, in terms of volume, margin and mix, S&S looks brighter than what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. In terms of ethanol also, if you think about similar way of thinking about volumes, volumes have been strong in terms of gasoline demand locally. Strong exports expected. We've had strong exports outlook for exports about 1.6 billion gallons for the year. In terms of margins, we've also again benefited from the fact that we've had good coproduct values particularly, again, in DCO. And that has helped us maintain margins. The other aspect is the RVOs have been finalized. So that puts -- removes the cloud from the regulatory landscape, at least for 2022. And gasoline -- and ethanol blending economics remain fantastic. If you include RIN values, that's above $2 relative to our BOB today. So I think based on all those facts, we think Q3 is going to be stronger quarter-over-quarter. And our outlook for the year is also very constructive. No. My comments were specifically quarter-over-quarter, significantly higher quarter-over-quarter for Q3. And what I just emphasized as well, we are constructive for the outlook for the full year. So I think, Ken, just providing context, going back to the Global Investor Day in terms of the framework, right, we talked about productivity and innovation driving about $1.1 billion in aggregate each. And then we expected market forces should be about $1 billion. In terms of 2023, we haven't gone through the specific plan yet, right? We are still working through that. But you could assume kind of a flat line, roughly speaking, over that 4-year time frame. What I would submit to you, Ken, is over the last 3 or 4 months, as Juan mentioned, we see additional opportunities on the horizon as it relates to operational transformation with digitization and automation. We talked about the Marshall example. If we multiply that Marshall example, the upside could be even more. But that's something that we are still fleshing out, and we will be prepared in the foreseen quarters to provide you a little more granularity on that. Juan? Yes. So Ken, just to be clear, we did not say an ASR. We did not say accelerated share repurchase, right? I want to make sure that we clarify that comment. We did say that we are going to do $1 billion in the back half of the year. And as you well know is EPS impact of that given the averaging is pretty minimized for this calendar year. So the impact, whether you consider a share repurchase in the $6.50 number or not is frankly insignificant for 2022. Yes. So thanks for the question, Steve. In terms of AS&O, I'll break it up. In terms of AS, we talked about destination marketing being very strong, right? So that's part of global trading. We anticipate that to remain strong given our ability to deliver to customers around the globe. And actually, we have the globally integrated network we have enables us to do that very effectively and efficiently. So we believe that's going to be a continued contributor of the growth. You think about also where we are positioned as a company in North America and South America. Where is the world likely going to come for grain in the back half of this year? It's probably going to be in North America. And with a reasonable crop that we expect right now, we should be well positioned to be able to benefit from that given our footprint. So I think the strength in destination marketing within global trade as well as our asset footprint and the dearth of grain around the globe in light of what's happened gives us good flexibility and constructive margin outlook for the back half. On the Oilseeds side, the fundamentals remain strong. I mean you've seen that the demand for oil both on the food side as well as RGD remains strong. So North American crush margins should be constructive. As soybean meal remains a very efficient and cost-effective protein substitute for even wheat as wheat prices, even though they've come up, they're still relatively expensive. So soybean meal remains an important feed for all types of protein and especially for poultry, and you've seen the number of poultry rising. So we're constructive for crush margins in North America. And even with biodiesel as well, that's also providing another avenue to support crush margins even in Europe. So crush margin outlook for the back half is strong in terms of the fundamentals that I highlighted. So candidly, the strength in AS&O is both on AS, as well as O for the back half of this year. Well, I think the inventory, when you're talking about us, I think our working capital effectively from Q1 to Q2 has come down a bit, Eric. So I think it's a function of both volumes as well as prices. Yes, prices have come off. But I think it's a function of also what's happening around the globe. You've got to think about not just our Ag Services and Oilseeds business. You got to think about also the other parts of our business. So while in general, there is a correlation to prices, there's also not necessarily same flat volume across every quarter. On the Human Nutrition side, it was a balanced growth across new customers as well as existing customers. And we think about our revenue growth in terms of volume, pricing and mix, right? So I think we had balanced growth across the 3. We drove early action on pricing to ensure that we maintain margins and kept a strong focus on driving mix. Price elasticity for some of the products -- or most of the products, frankly, we participate in Human Nutrition has tended to be pretty low as Juan noted. So I think that's helped benefit protecting margins as well as driving revenue growth. On the Animal Nutrition side, as I highlighted in my prepared comments, most of that growth has come from amino acids, and amino acids has benefited from, a, the relative protein demand as well as supply chain challenges out of China. And the third aspect that's benefited us is our conscious effort to switch from liquid lysine to dry lysine and that's -- sorry, so from dry lysine to liquid lysine, yes. And that's actually helped us drive improved profitability and improved margins as well as increase stickiness with our customers. So most of that volume growth in Animal Nutrition has been driven by amino acids."

I will now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Michael. This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.90. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.6 billion. Our trailing four quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $5.3 billion, and our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 10.6%. What we saw in the first quarter was an extension and amplification of the factors that supported our growth in 2021. First was our team's great execution. Exceptional growth in nutrition and effective risk management exemplified how we continued to serve our customers and provide nutrition around the globe amid volatile market conditions and an inflationary environment. Second was an environment of tight supply and demand. We operated in the first quarter in a constrained supply environment for crops, mostly driven by the smaller South American crop, and for other products driven by some continued supply chain and labor availability issues. And we continued to see solid global demand across most of our products and in most regions. While the pandemic is not over and we're particularly monitoring the impact of rising cases and lockdowns in China, much of the world continued to emerge. Pent-up demand remained solid, even in the phase of higher prices. The great work our team did was in service to our customers, our company and our purpose. Our company has come together once again in the wake of the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. ADM has about 650 colleagues in Ukraine, and of course, our highest priority continues to be supporting and protecting them and their families as well as helping Ukrainian farmers to get as much of their crop production as possible into world markets. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of Ukraine. Slide 4, please. Food security is foundational to ADM's purpose and beliefs and recent events have only magnified its importance. From a global pandemic to the short crop in South America to the conflict in Ukraine, it has become clear that we cannot take an abundant and efficient supply of food for granted. Even beyond the current dislocations, this issue will remain one of critical importance over the next many years. As the global population grows, the need for nutrition will continue to grow with it. At our Global Investor Day last December, we talked about how we expect demand to push global trade flows of corn, wheat, soybeans and soybean meal up 21% or 130 million tons in the next 10 years. Meeting that demand will not happen automatically. It will take dedication, expertise and agility as well as global scale and capabilities. An example of that is ADM's destination marketing network, which gives us a presence in more regions where demand is strong and growing as well as more direct connections to customers and the ability to offer the full end-to-end capabilities of our integrated value chain. We are seeing how important that is today as customers are coming to us knowing that they can rely on ADM to meet their specific needs in a supply-constrained environment. We are not immune to the impacts of global disruptions, including those in the Black Sea region, but our broad portfolio of nutrition products and our ability to efficiently move them around the world will allow us to manage through these dynamic market conditions and continue to help support the food needs of billions of people. Please turn to Slide 5. Sustainability is another one of the global trends, so important to our companies and our planet's future. We remain focused on our strategy, which is aligned with fast growing demand for an array of products that are environmentally friendly, including alternative proteins. That industry continues to show impressive growth. Global sales for alternative meats and dairy products are expected to increase 14% annually, reaching is targeting $125 billion by 2030. When you look at the full range of products that alternative proteins could go into from meat alternatives and meat extensions to emerging categories like ready meals and specialized nutrition, the opportunities are even greater. Our own growth in this area is faster than the industries. The quality of our product, our integrated end-to-end value chain, our innovative product development and application capabilities and our global scale make us the partner of choice for our customers. In fact, we never had a stronger demand for our alternative protein products than we are seeing now and we are confident in continued growth. That is why earlier this month, we announced a significant investment to nearly double extrusion capacity at our Decatur, Illinois specialty protein complex. We also announced the industry's first end-to-end alternative Protein Innovation Center. This, of course, follows up on last year's addition of leading European alternative protein provider, Sojaprotein. Alternative proteins are just one of the many areas in which we are expanding our capabilities to meet growing customer demand for more environmentally responsible products. Our Biosolutions team, for example, continued to expand its pipeline and advance the evolution of our Carbohydrate Solutions business with an impressive $55 million in revenue growth in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 6. We are advancing sustainability commitments in other parts of our business as well. Last year, we unveiled new goals to reduce its Scope 3 emissions and eliminate deforestation from our supply chain. This is critical work. We do not make these kinds of commitments without an achievable plan to meet them. And once we move forward, we constantly challenge ourselves to do it faster. That is why last week, we announced that we've accelerated our deadline for a completely deforestation free supply chain by five years from 2030 to 2025. We also recently committed to work with the science-based targets initiative with the goal of obtaining their approval of ADM's climate targets and our alignment with ambitious global goals to limit rising temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Across ADM, we are continuing to align our portfolio with the world's growing needs and with our own purpose, positioning us to serve our customers, our communities and our planet and powering our future. I'll discuss our business outlook at the end of our call, but in the meantime, I'd like to turn to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?\nVikram Luthar: Thanks, Juan. Slide 7 please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team effectively manage risk and executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment of robust global demand and tight supply, driven primarily by the short South American crop. Ag Services results were significantly higher versus the first quarter of 2021. Global Trade results were higher, driven by strong performances in destination marketing and global ocean freight. North American origination margins and volumes were lower year-over-year, including approximately $75 million in negative timing effects, which will reverse in the coming quarters. Crushing was higher year-over-year in a strong global margin environment, driven by robust protein and vegetable oil demand. Improving margins in the quarter resulted in approximately $60 million in negative timing effects, which will reverse in the coming quarters versus approximately $50 million in positive timing in the prior year quarter. Refined products and other results were much higher than the prior year period, driven by healthy refining premiums and good refined oils demand in North America, as well as strong biodiesel margins in EMEA. Equity earnings from Wilmar were significantly higher versus the first quarter of 2021. Looking ahead, we expect substantially higher Q2 AS&O results than the second quarter of 2021. Slide 8 please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered substantially higher year-over-year results. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment including ethanol production from our wet mills delivered much higher results versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher corn co-product revenues, improved citric acid profits and excellent risk management in North America, higher volumes and margins in EMEA and higher volumes and margins in wheat milling. Sales volumes for starches and sweeteners continued their recovery toward pre-pandemic levels. And as Juan mentioned, our biosolutions platform continue to deliver impressive growth with $55 million in new sales as demand for plant-based products expands into more diverse applications. Vantage corn processes delivered solid execution margins, but position losses on ethanol inventory as prices fell early in the quarter, drove lower results versus the prior year. The prior year quarter\u2019s results also benefited from demand for USP-grade industrial alcohol from the Peoria facility, which was divested in Q4 2021. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect the current market dynamics to continue delivering carbohydrate solutions results similar to the very strong second quarter of 2021. On Slide 9, the nutrition business delivered continued strong profit growth. Revenues increased by a very impressive 23%, even when adjusting for currency effects and removing the impacts of recent acquisitions revenue was up by 17%. And while margins have softened somewhat they remain healthy. Human Nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results. Flavors continued to deliver solid revenue growth, offset by some higher costs. Strong sales growth in alternative proteins, including contributions from our Sojaprotein acquisition, and positive currency timing effects in South America, offset some higher operating costs to help deliver better year-over-year results in Specialty Ingredients. Health and wellness results were was also higher year-over-year, powered by continued growth in probiotics, including our late-2021 Deerland Probiotics acquisition, and robust demand for fiber. Animal nutrition profits were nearly double the year-ago period, due primarily to strength in amino acids, driven by a combination of product mix changes, improved North American demand and global supply chain disruptions. Looking ahead, we expect nutrition to deliver as second quarter significantly higher than the prior year period. And with our recent acquisitions delivering ahead of our expectations, we are raising a profit growth outlook for the full year from 15% plus to 20%. Slide 10, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the Other segment, as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were substantially higher driven primarily by better performance in captive insurance, including reduced claims settlements versus the prior year. Some of the claims settlements that we expected to negatively impact Q1 results are now expected in the second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was higher year-over-year on higher expense for long-term debt, higher short-term borrowings to support working capital needs and interest-related to a tax item. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $209 million were due primarily to higher IT operating and project related costs and higher costs in the company\u2019s centers of excellence, partially offset by incentive compensation, accrual adjustments. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was approximately 16%. For the full year, we are now anticipating an effective tax rate at the higher end of our previously guided range of 16% to 19%. Cash flow generation remained strong $1.6 billion before working capital changes versus $1.2 billion in the prior year period. Our balance sheet remained solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 34% and available liquidity of about $9.3 billion, even with almost $3 billion in higher working capital needs since December. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vikram. Slide 11, please. After a strong start of the year, we are looking ahead. In the near-term future, we expect lower crop supplies caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops, and now the Black Sea disruptions to drive continued tightness in global grain markets through 2022 well into 2023 and perhaps beyond. As we look further ahead, markets will continue to reflect the importance of the enduring global trends that are fueling performance across our portfolio, including a growing global population, driving expansion in demand for food and healthy nutrition. That is why the work we\u2019ve done to build a better ADM is so important. We have the global integrated network, risk management capabilities and diverse product portfolio to help us navigate through tight market conditions and meet global nutritional needs. This is the challenge we expanded, improved and repositioned our business to meet. And we\u2019ll continue to advance our strategy and grow our capabilities through our productivity and innovation initiatives in order to drive performance under our control and deliver on the evolving needs of our customers, but it doesn't stop with ADM. Our working with other participants across the food and agriculture value chain, from farmers who continue to do more every year to sustainably increase production, to technology providers who offer new ways to make more with less, to governments who in a tight supply and demand environment, should resist the impulse to impose export restrictions. So looking at the balance of the year, when we combine the strategic work we have done to align our portfolio with fundamental global trends with our strong execution and the expectation of a continued tight supply-demand environment, we expect 2022 results to substantially exceed 2021's. And as we look further ahead to a future of increasing needs for more and better foods, we will continue to work to add new adjacent products to address the world's toughest challenges and unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life. Once again, I'd like to thank our colleagues around the globe for their commitment and hard work to serve vital global needs in a challenging and dynamic environment. With that, Emily, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. In the interest of time please limit yourself to one question and rejoin the queue for additional follow ups.  Our first question today comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam, your line is open.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: Good morning. So I want to \u2013 Vikram, I guess, first question just as we think about the current market environment, obviously, a tremendous number of moving pieces. I guess I'm trying to calibrate some of the things that could prove more enduring to the business. And the one that sticks out, I mean, is inflation broadly. And I'm thinking about energy costs and what that \u2013 especially in Europe, thinking about construction costs for new plants. And I'm just trying to think, specifically in oilseeds, how higher operating costs in Europe, higher replacement costs if we're thinking about new builds, how that might be impacting oilseed crush margins around the world? And do you think that has a bit longer tail to it? And I would think that benefits you, given your footprint is principally in the Americas.\nVikram Luthar: Yes, Adam, thanks for the question. Yes, in terms of energy costs, clearly, we are not immune to that and we've seen an elevation in energy costs. As you well know, we have a program to actively hedge our program. So I think to a large degree, we've been successful in doing that. Nevertheless, in places like Europe, where energy costs have been significantly elevated, yes, that's had an impact on net margins. But as you look at the broader dynamics, we continue to see very strong outlook in terms of vegetable demand as well as protein demand. And as you see, most of the grain flows, given what's happening around the world particularly in the Black Sea region and the short South American crop moving to North America that should actually support us in terms of our footprint. So the structural changes associated with RGD remain very much in intact. So we think longer term, we feel very confident about the move higher that we cited in the Global Investor Day in terms of crush margins. And for 2022, in particular, we see even farther \u2013 even more strength, given some of the near-term dynamics I just referenced.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess the second question is more on capital, on the balance sheet, and I think it was impressive to see in the quarter the growth in inventories, yet the committed credit capacity basically being unchanged from year-end. And I'm wondering how you think about that as a strategic asset and the opportunities it presents both in terms of merchandising and risk in the short-term, but also if the M&A pipeline is maybe improving as some others may not have the liquidity that you do in the current high commodity environment?\nVikram Luthar: Yes, Adam, we clearly view our balance sheet as a competitive advantage. And in terms of capital allocation, we've talked about this before. Our capital allocation is inextricably linked to our strategy. In terms of the guidelines, in terms of the framework, we've articulated about 30% to 40% of our cash flow as we'll direct towards capital expenditures and the remaining 60% to 70% for strategic growth investments. And given our balance sheet flexibility, we are clearly in a position to undertake some of those growth investments, including M&A, if that becomes attractive, but also shareholder distributions, including 30% to 40% towards dividends. As we cited in Global Investor Day, we expect dividend payouts to be actually at the higher end of that 30% to 40% range in the near to medium term. But at the end of the day, if you step back, think about the operating cash flow we generated, $1.6 billion in Q1. So we should be in a position to conduct meaningful buybacks as well in the medium term, as we noted in the Global Investor Day. In the near term, we will repurchase shares to at least offset dilution.\nAdam Samuelson: Great. And that color is all really helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Ben, please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Yes, perfect. Thank you very much. Juan, Vikram, congrats on the strong results. I wanted to ask a question around just the global freight and global trade environment, and obviously, with some of the backlog that's been caused on unloading ships over in China because of all the lockdowns. Have you seen or are you seeing any incremental disruptions over the last couple of weeks that you think is going to cost greater opportunities for you guys within the next coming weeks to excel here and to ultimately deliver a strong quarter on the ex-service piece, just similarly what we saw already in 1Q?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you Ben and good morning. Of course, we've been dealing with supply chain issues for a while, and I think that the situation in China has nothing more than just bring back more challenges, if you will. We see the number of ships in congestion, if you will, from Capesize, Panamax, Supramax and Handysize have increased over the last week, increases about 10% give or take depending on the category. So I think that's especially complicated as you see that because of the different conflicts and different shortages in crops that we have, some of these trading flows around the world that are being redirected. So you redirect trading flows with maybe less ship availability and higher freight and longer travel times. So the situation continues to be dire. And that's why it's so important to have a team, a global team, very active with many options to provide supply and then to reach different destinations. So the combination, if you will, of our global trade with the destination marketing and all that becomes more and more important every day for customers around the world.\nBen Theurer: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. I'll leave it here so you can stay on track.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with JP Morgan. Tom, please go ahead with your question.\nTom Palmer: Good morning and thank you for the question. Maybe just follow up on the outlook for the second quarter in the AS&O segment, maybe just a little commentary on the subsegment expectations. Are you expecting year-over-year profit increases across all three of the subsegments? Are there any to call out of particular strength?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I would say our first quarter was \u2013 showed strength across the three businesses, very good performance. And as we look at Q2, probably we see the same. There was some reduction in exports in Ag Services in the first quarter because of weather issues and some of that has been moved into the second quarter, so we have a good book there. China has put some orders also for corn Q2 and Q3. We expect the crush profits to continue to be very strong in the second quarter, certainly, refining margins also very good. So I would say demand has been domestically strong for soybean meal in North America and certainly a lot of demand around the world for that. So, we continue to see crush very well supported by the oil and the meal. We continue to see demand for our exports in the second quarter. So had the window of exports of North America, we will have expanded a little bit. And certainly, the refining materials are \u2013 they've maintained very strong margins. If you look at last year, we entered into Q1 with low margins and we ended with strong margins. This year has been strong margins across the quarter and we expect that to continue into the second quarter.\nTom Palmer: Great. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ken.\nOperator: Apologies, we have lost Ken from the queue. So next in the queue we have Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Ben, your line is open.\nBen Bienvenu: Hi, thanks. Good morning everybody.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ben.\nVikram Luthar: Good morning.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to ask about the nutrition business. Strong results in the first quarter, you noted it, versus the prior expectation of 15% plus, now 20% growth for the year. You called out acquisition contribution or the performance of acquisitions. Is that a fair breakdown of organic versus inorganic growth, thinking about maybe 15% organic growth plus 5% inorganic? Or how would you delineate between the two contributing factors?\nVikram Luthar: Well, so as we talked about \u2013 I referenced in my comments, Ben, the revenue growth, right, was 23%. And if you exclude M&A and adjusted for FX, it was 17%, so strong revenue growth frankly across Human Nutrition and Animal Nutrition. The reason our profits were stronger than what we had guided in Q4 were threefold. One is, we did expect some upfront costs that we cited and we had anticipated inflationary cost pressures and supply disruptions. However, with the smart pricing and active supply chain collaboration with our AS&O carb solutions teams, we manage these very well across all the nutrition businesses. The other aspect as we talked about industry-leading win rates in our Global Investor Day, actually our win rates are even expanding beyond that. And the second point is, as you referenced, the OP contribution from our M&A were actually higher than expected. The third point is amino acids. Because of the deliberate switch we mad e from dry to liquid lysine last year, combined with the strong North American protein demand and the supply chain disruptions, our contribution from amino acids business was actually higher. So really, it's a reflection of those three factors that resulted in higher than expected nutrition profit for Q1.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, great. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: We do have a question on the line now from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken, please go ahead.\nKen Zaslow: Hi, good morning guys. \nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ken.\nVikram Luthar: Good morning.\nKen Zaslow: When I think about longer term, you guys set out two targets: one, high single-digit growth, and then the $6 to $7 outlook by 2025. Given the operating environment, I know you just literally just put this out, so it's hard to change it on a change of environment. But how do you see that? Do you think that the growth rate is higher? Or do you think that the ability to get to the $6 to $7 comes earlier than expected given the favorable operating environment?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Ken. Good question. Listen, when we put the plan in front of shareholders in December, we're just mostly to explain how our company and our business model and portfolio continues to evolve, aligning ourselves with markets of higher growth rates and actually higher margins. And so, what we can control, as you can imagine, is a portfolio, capital allocation and our execution, so we focus on that. So directionally, we're going into that, and we just put a milestone there to have a reference for investors. Of course, at this point in time, we're going to hit those numbers earlier. It is obvious. But I think we don't worry that much of the pace. It's more important for us the direction we're going is higher margins, higher growth rates. The pace sometimes is dictated for outside events in which our team and their execution are supposed to capitalize as much as possible into them. So do you ask me, it's going to be $6 to $7 in 2025, certainly, is going to happen sooner than that. But again, I think it's important to keep the team continue to build that better company with Vikram's explain how we have generated $1.6 billion of cash flow in this, that gives us much more optionality on how much to accelerate that shift of the company into higher margin and higher growth rates. And to be honest, after we have created nutrition and nutrition \u2013 we continue to upgrade targets, even if they make $700 million last year. We are now focusing on building the next scale business. We're looking at microbial solutions and how that will drive the next generation of food and proteins. We are looking at climate solutions or biosolutions, which will drive the next generation of sustainable products and also microbiome modulators, which with the pre, pro and post biotics will drive personalized health and nutrition. And let me remind you and the shareholders, contributions for all these three elements that we're thinking on building was basically muted during the forecast that we showed in the December Global Investor Day. So we feel pretty good about the existing business is delivering $6 to $7 maybe earlier than expected, but we have in the capabilities to build the next scale business for ADM.\nKen Zaslow: Great. And then my follow-up question is, when I think about the renewable diesel and the way it's going to happen. And with the backdrop of inflation, how does the balance between the renewable diesel kind of going versus the potential for inflation to curtail that, where do you see that renewable diesel already, the horse is already out of the barn that momentum as we continue versus is there a potential that the inflation can kind of either elongate the timing of it or delay anything. And then I'll leave it there and I appreciate your time.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ken. Good questions as always. Listen, first of all, let me say on that, I'm very proud that our team, and remember, when we announced speeded with, we said we've been looking at that for two years. So we took into considerations, all of these aspects. And so our product remains to be remains on schedule to deliver on the harvest 2023. So most important, what we can control that project is going well and we managing through inflations and delays. So proud of the team there. Listen, at the end of the day, we still expect the significant new capacity will come online. Of course, when there are so many announcements in any industry, you're going to have the percentage of that being coming on a stream. I think that there may be somebody ability on the timing of all that, it doesn't escape anybody that there are labor availability issues, especially in the U.S., certainly raw materials, whether it is a steel or energy or whatever are more expensive than whenever some of these things were announced. And maybe the builders of these hedge, the raw materials exposure to both things in anticipation but I will say, if there is some delay, it may not be bad to allow crush expansions to actually come on a stream. So they can provide the soybean oil for all these plants to run and we also wait for canola to have a path to that. So I think, listen, the industry will develop, it may have some short-term issues here or there, but at the end of the day, a significant piece of new demand for soybean oil is being built and will be built.\nKen Zaslow: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, ken.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nSteve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Given those comments you just made there Juan about the outlook for renewable diesel and you also had comments in your slide deck about your own views about the demand growth for alternative meat and dairy, which could potentially lead to less demand for soybean meal. I'm curious to hear your own view on, do you see any challenge here meeting what might be a disparate growth in demand for the oil versus the meal side of all of these crush plants that are going to be built.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Listen, it's a very good question. And we look at that, of course, with a lot of attention. I think right now, when we see the capacity coming, it's all capacity needed actually to supply the growth of protein around the world. We see North America with very strong domestic demand for meal, but we see also in North America soybean meal being the most competitive around the world. Especially now, when you have issues in Argentina with some changes in the deal when you have short crops in South America, like we have had and we continue to have a strong demand. We see also that customers are relatively open, so there's not a lot of inventory in the chain that are one point needs to be flushed out. And when you look at, what's happening with feed and competitive feeds, certainly wheat given the conflict in Ukraine, the unfortunate conflict in Ukraine. Wheat prices needs to go up high enough that they get out of the feeding Russians, so they can be preserved to feeding people. When you take that up, you bring corn, the most effective carbohydrate and corn immediately brings soybean meal into the Russian. So we're not only see strong demand, but we see high inclusion rates staying. And again, given the strong leg of soybean oil in North America that will make soybean meal the most competitive in the world. So we actually are very positive about that demand and we think that we need all the expansion to match the market share that soybean meal North America will take from the rest of the world.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you, Juan. Maybe just one more on the oil side and that is, what do you see as the global impacts of Indonesia's ban on palm oil exports. How does that affect the global supply of oil and your business in particular?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Oils have been tied for several months already, if not the year and of course, any announcement in the proximity also of the largest producer of palm oil in the world rattles the markets. Of course, it was immediately clarified that this doesn't include crude palm oil, which is the biggest product. So I would say, I think Indonesia is just trying to take a short-term palliative for their domestic inflation. I don't think it will significantly alter the global balances. Although, the global balance is continue to be very tight and any disruption, we have the Ukrainian disruption of course with and the Russian with sunflower oil so this is an area that everybody has to pay a lot of attention and it will require companies like ADM to having the ability to reformulate, so we can take some customers that our existing customers or either palm oil or sunflower oil to have alternatives to continue to supply their customers. So we are seeing that through our Olenex joint venture, we're seeing that through our Stratas joint venture. So as we\u2019ve seen the opportunity to add a lot of value to some of the customers that are looking for replacements at this point in time.\nSteve Byrne: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Robert, please go ahead with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little insight into your visibility into crush margins in the second half of this year. Are your customers locking in their commitments for demand and supplying you yet? And can you use that to lock-in those margins. And then I had a quick follow-up if I could.\nJuan Luciano: Sure. Yes, Rob. As I said, I think that we have very strong visibility of course into Q2. I would say further than that, I think customers \u2013 the markets are inverted. So customers see prices relatively high right now, those customers that are not covered, they feel like maybe the course is showing them that they can get covered later at the cheaper rate than today. So I would say, in general, we have coverage for the next quarter, not for Q3 or Q4. But when we look at the demand that we are seeing around the world, we think that when you think about meal and oil, in general, not only North America, but also Brazil. The crush margins need to be there to encourage the crushers to crush. We need the demand for oil and we need the soybean meal. So you will have to have the demand, the crush margins to incentivate people to crush. And we are seeing that with the margins that are happening in Brazil or the U.S. or Europe, all our margins today are higher than what we anticipated. And we think that that's the year rollout and demand continues to be solid out there and strong, crush margins will continue to send that signal to all of our crushers, which is we need the meal, we need the oil keep crushing.\nRobert Moskow: Got it. And just a follow-up, you mentioned ocean freight being a big benefit. And I think it had to do with some redirecting of ships in China related to lockdowns. But I'm sure, it also has to do with just overall moving freight from one destination to another and shifting directions. Can I assume that is a big benefit to you and that could continue for the rest of 2022 or is it kind of like more episodic in nature.\nJuan Luciano: Rob, we have \u2013 as part of our global trade group, we have a strong ocean freight group and they work hand in glove to make sure that we continue to serve the customers with the most effective destinations, the most efficient destinations. So we are a big player. And as a big player with a lot of resources, we tend to have a relative advantage to others. So when things get complicated and right now, they are very complicated. We tend to have a relative higher competitive advantage than others. So I think that shows in the margins that we obtained in this. And logistics right now are complicated. They are complicated in the river. They are complicated in the oceans and there is a lot of redrawing of trade flows and you can only redraw a lot of trade flows, if you have a lot of origin options and a lot of destination options, because you need to connect both. And our ocean freight group counts with that blessing, which is ADM originating all the key parts of the world. I have destination units in all key parts of the world. So it provides them with more ability to play supply routes than maybe other players.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent, your line is open.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and congratulations to Vikram and Ray on your new roles. And Ray, it was great to work with you all those years. Juan, could I ask you just to talk a little bit about, how you're thinking about the consumer and consumer demand, maybe particularly in Europe, but I guess, also globally. Just given we have a lot of food inflation, we have lot of energy inflation. What do you think gives clearly we need to destroy some demand just given how tight suppliers. But how are you thinking about that equation this year into next year?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Listen, we are paying, of course, close attention to that. At this point in time, we haven't seen any significant impact on demand for us. If you think about so far customers are paying higher prices, but they still, especially in North America, they still haven't changed their behaviors. We think that, of course, if you have disposable income suffering from higher gas prices and higher food prices eventually, they will have to adjust. We have seen more to be honest, Vincent, in the \u2013 some of the emerging markets in which may be food is a bigger percentage of their disposable income. So we have seen some adjustments, a small adjustment in that. But I would say, at this point in time, we have not seen any relevant or material adjustment to our demand. And we think that given the pent-up demand that existed from recovery of the coming out of COVID, people, in general, have been \u2013 having higher saving rates. And we have seen wage inflation around the world that have gotten more money in the pockets of many. So at this point in time, we think consumer has been and demand has been very resilient. But there\u2019s going to be a point in which disposable income will get tight and we will see some changes into that. We haven\u2019t seen it yet. We don\u2019t see it in the immediate future either.\nVincent Andrews: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Michael, please go ahead.\nMichael Piken: Yes. Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the impact of the ADM crew here in the U.S. as well as internationally and what that might look like in terms of the impact for meal demand.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Listen Michael, we haven\u2019t seen at this point in time any significant impact to our poultry demand in North America. The numbers at this point in time seems to be about half the size of the issue that was in 2015. So it\u2019s something we are following very closely. Of course, but we cannot say that we have an impact so far. And hopefully this virus are difficult to control. So of course, there is a lot of sanitary elements being thrown at that, hopefully, that will placate. But we will have to keep a close eye to them.\nMichael Piken: Great. And a follow-up question is just shifting gears. Are you concerned about the movement of fertilizer throughout the world? I know you have a fertilizer business. But beyond that just the impact if we do end up in a really tight grain environment, are you \u2013 how do you think there is a food versus fuel debate. How do you see that sort of playing out? And is there any risk to the ethanol volumes or the growth in biodiesel or how do you sort of see that playing out. Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. On fertilizers, to be honest, Michael, of course, fertilizer supply chains are tight and it\u2019s been highly publicized. However, our evidence shows that trade lanes are adopting and markets are getting sufficient supplies of fertilizer. Of course, we had much higher prices that will drive prices for grain. I think today, especially Brazil \u2013 the U.S. certainly have the fertilizer for this crop. So the question is the Brazilian crop, which is coming in a few months. And I think it is still possible what we get from our people in Brazil to get enough potassium fertilizer in country by the planting season. And of course, any shortages can produce production losses. But at this point in time, when people are thinking between maybe 15% or 20% less application at that level, we don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to see a significant change in the production forecast. It is probably more depending on the weather at this point in time and rain than fertilizer application. And the second was on food versus fuel. At this point in time, I think that we are committed to try to help the world with food and the environment. So they\u2019re both axis of the same equation. I would say, they both touch disposable income that I was saying before, if you get ethanol to reduce the cost of gasoline that creates more disposable income to take on food inflation. If you take \u2013 if you don\u2019t put any biofuels into gasoline and you pay more for gasoline, then you may get cheaper food, but you have less disposable income there. So, to be honest, I think the molecules react to the prices that they are given in the market given the different regulations and the different values. Well, we try to be as efficient as possible bring in as much of those \u2013 as many of those molecules to the market as possible to satisfy everybody. So I think at this point in time, we have seen some corrections in certain biofuels mandates across the world. But in other countries, it has been only a reduction and not an elimination. So this \u2013 I think they are short-term things, because we still have the climate crisis, which is a long-term objective that mostly the transportation industry, but also every industry will have to address biofuels, sustainable aviation fuels and all that are a big part of that reduction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Larson from Seaport Research Partners. Eric, please go ahead.\nEric Larson: Yes. Thanks. Congratulations, everybody. And Vikram, I congratulate you on your new role and Ray you as well. I look forward to working with both of you on that. So congrats. So listening to the call today, Juan, I hear as all of us, there is a lot of confusion, there\u2019s lot of moving parts. So when I look back 10 weeks ago, I realized that U.S. grain prices had to move higher in order to even \u2013 kind of even begin to maybe ration demand or not, and of course, they\u2019ve moved quite a bit higher. So what I\u2019d really like you to do Juan is, kind of take a 30,000 foot view point here. As we all know price does ultimately ration demand. And the only thing I can see that would maybe through that at this point is maybe global recession or U.S. recession. So can you kind of \u2013 I don\u2019t see a lot of demand destruction at this point a little bit from bird flu, maybe it\u2019s 25 million bushels, which is a spit in the ocean. But do you see any significant demand destruction today and including what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. And what they have in storage for corn and other things. What \u2013 how do you look at the world today from a demand \u2013 total demand perspective versus supply and are we seeing demand destruction with high prices?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Eric. Let me see \u2013 let me tell you how I see this. So last year was a big production year and the world needed to consume more grain than that big production. So the issue is, the world continues to grow and sometimes it\u2019s not a matter of population growth, but it\u2019s a matter of income. And how people like \u2013 people in China has been an incredible economic improvement of their standards on living that improve their diet, that doesn\u2019t go down. So we think that\u2019s where we keep on talking about our trend of food security. We will have to provide more for the world. In situations like today, where we are already tight from a supply demand perspective and we will get tighter as demand continues to grow. We see here in ADM that at least we need two very good seasons of crops in North America and South America to actually balance and become more comfortable in those supply-demand balances. When we think about prices today, prices today are going up to mark three things that needs to happen. One is export prices need to go up to being able to draw out all the inventories that are stuck there or they are safe, they are hoarded there to be able to replace the production that we have lost. The production we have lost in South America, but the production we are losing now in the Ukraine and Russia. So first, you need to draw out those inventories and bring them into market. So we can balance ourselves. The second, as I said before, wheat needs to be placed out of the Russians. So you can be preserved for human consumption. And the third one is to give farmers like you, the signal that they need to plant more and I think the world need more acres. Those acres today, they are not going to happen from the Baltic area, they are not going to happen from U.S. that we are basically maxed out. So they may happen in South America. So we need higher prices to bring South American acres, we need higher prices to draw those inventories into the market. And we need two good years of crops, both in North America and South America. That will allow us to balance the supply demand, given the strong demand.\nEric Larson: Yes. And I agree is that \u2013 we need this year\u2019s crop in the U.S., next year\u2019s crop in Brazil and we need 2023 in the U.S. to do very well again. And maybe even another \u2013 we need four maybe big crops around the world. But sometimes what rebalances some of this is, this high inflation rate we have around the world, there is an economic recession that comes in place. Have you factored anything into that forecast that would change your outlook?\nJuan Luciano: Eric, I\u2019m not an economist. But I think there is a narrow path to achieve a soft landing here. And the U.S. economy has been very resilient through all this events. So I think the U.S. economy is driven by the consumer. The consumer has been saving money for two years that they didn\u2019t spend a lot. And as I said before, they were COVID recovery packages. But there is also been salary inflations and wages inflation that has put money in the pockets of customers. So I think that for the foreseeable future, we don\u2019t see a significant impact of demand. If not, we will be flagging that out, but we look at that, we look at our plans, we are preparing our plans for a long period of the strong demand. We want to run them at high capacity. So at this point in time, I don\u2019t see an issue in the west maybe the only flag is how COVID lockdowns evolve in China. But that I don\u2019t have a lot of visibility at this point in time.\nEric Larson: All right. Thank you, Juan. I appreciate your comments.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: Those are all the questions we have time for today. So I will now turn the call back over to Juan Luciano.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Emily. Before we close our call, I wanted to take a minute to thank Ray for his exceptional contribution all this year to ADM\u2019s as our CFO. So thank you, Ray. And it\u2019s been a pleasure and I\u2019m delighted that you continue with us to continue to help take ADM\u2019s a bigger player.\nRay Young: Thank you, Juan. And also I just want to thank all the investors and all the analysts for really like 11 years in this role, I\u2019ve grown, I\u2019ve learned from you. And hopefully, we\u2019ve been also been able to teach you about ADM and how this is a great company. And the future is incredible for this company and I look forward to continuing support Juan and support the company in my new role. So thank you, Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you and congratulations, Ray. And, of course, welcome Vikram and this was your baptism of fire here in the earnings call. So thank you very much and welcome to the role and looking forward to it.\nVikram Luthar: Thank you so much, Juan.\nMichael Cross: Thank you everybody for joining us today. Slide 12 notes upcoming investor events in which will be participating. I will also note that our annual sustainability report, which will detail our significant progress and our bold ambitions across the value chain is scheduled to be published in May. As always, please feel free to follow-up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day. And thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.90. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.6 billion. Our trailing four quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $5.3 billion, and our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 10.6%. What we saw in the first quarter was an extension and amplification of the factors that supported our growth in 2021. First was our team's great execution. Exceptional growth in nutrition and effective risk management exemplified how we continued to serve our customers and provide nutrition around the globe amid volatile market conditions and an inflationary environment. Second was an environment of tight supply and demand. We operated in the first quarter in a constrained supply environment for crops, mostly driven by the smaller South American crop, and for other products driven by some continued supply chain and labor availability issues. And we continued to see solid global demand across most of our products and in most regions. While the pandemic is not over and we're particularly monitoring the impact of rising cases and lockdowns in China, much of the world continued to emerge. Pent-up demand remained solid, even in the phase of higher prices. The great work our team did was in service to our customers, our company and our purpose. Our company has come together once again in the wake of the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. ADM has about 650 colleagues in Ukraine, and of course, our highest priority continues to be supporting and protecting them and their families as well as helping Ukrainian farmers to get as much of their crop production as possible into world markets. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of Ukraine. Slide 4, please. Food security is foundational to ADM's purpose and beliefs and recent events have only magnified its importance. From a global pandemic to the short crop in South America to the conflict in Ukraine, it has become clear that we cannot take an abundant and efficient supply of food for granted. Even beyond the current dislocations, this issue will remain one of critical importance over the next many years. As the global population grows, the need for nutrition will continue to grow with it. At our Global Investor Day last December, we talked about how we expect demand to push global trade flows of corn, wheat, soybeans and soybean meal up 21% or 130 million tons in the next 10 years. Meeting that demand will not happen automatically. It will take dedication, expertise and agility as well as global scale and capabilities. An example of that is ADM's destination marketing network, which gives us a presence in more regions where demand is strong and growing as well as more direct connections to customers and the ability to offer the full end-to-end capabilities of our integrated value chain. We are seeing how important that is today as customers are coming to us knowing that they can rely on ADM to meet their specific needs in a supply-constrained environment. We are not immune to the impacts of global disruptions, including those in the Black Sea region, but our broad portfolio of nutrition products and our ability to efficiently move them around the world will allow us to manage through these dynamic market conditions and continue to help support the food needs of billions of people. Please turn to Slide 5. Sustainability is another one of the global trends, so important to our companies and our planet's future. We remain focused on our strategy, which is aligned with fast growing demand for an array of products that are environmentally friendly, including alternative proteins. That industry continues to show impressive growth. Global sales for alternative meats and dairy products are expected to increase 14% annually, reaching is targeting $125 billion by 2030. When you look at the full range of products that alternative proteins could go into from meat alternatives and meat extensions to emerging categories like ready meals and specialized nutrition, the opportunities are even greater. Our own growth in this area is faster than the industries. The quality of our product, our integrated end-to-end value chain, our innovative product development and application capabilities and our global scale make us the partner of choice for our customers. In fact, we never had a stronger demand for our alternative protein products than we are seeing now and we are confident in continued growth. That is why earlier this month, we announced a significant investment to nearly double extrusion capacity at our Decatur, Illinois specialty protein complex. We also announced the industry's first end-to-end alternative Protein Innovation Center. This, of course, follows up on last year's addition of leading European alternative protein provider, Sojaprotein. Alternative proteins are just one of the many areas in which we are expanding our capabilities to meet growing customer demand for more environmentally responsible products. Our Biosolutions team, for example, continued to expand its pipeline and advance the evolution of our Carbohydrate Solutions business with an impressive $55 million in revenue growth in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 6. We are advancing sustainability commitments in other parts of our business as well. Last year, we unveiled new goals to reduce its Scope 3 emissions and eliminate deforestation from our supply chain. This is critical work. We do not make these kinds of commitments without an achievable plan to meet them. And once we move forward, we constantly challenge ourselves to do it faster. That is why last week, we announced that we've accelerated our deadline for a completely deforestation free supply chain by five years from 2030 to 2025. We also recently committed to work with the science-based targets initiative with the goal of obtaining their approval of ADM's climate targets and our alignment with ambitious global goals to limit rising temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Across ADM, we are continuing to align our portfolio with the world's growing needs and with our own purpose, positioning us to serve our customers, our communities and our planet and powering our future. I'll discuss our business outlook at the end of our call, but in the meantime, I'd like to turn to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram? Thank you, Vikram. Slide 11, please. After a strong start of the year, we are looking ahead. In the near-term future, we expect lower crop supplies caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops, and now the Black Sea disruptions to drive continued tightness in global grain markets through 2022 well into 2023 and perhaps beyond. As we look further ahead, markets will continue to reflect the importance of the enduring global trends that are fueling performance across our portfolio, including a growing global population, driving expansion in demand for food and healthy nutrition. That is why the work we've done to build a better ADM is so important. We have the global integrated network, risk management capabilities and diverse product portfolio to help us navigate through tight market conditions and meet global nutritional needs. This is the challenge we expanded, improved and repositioned our business to meet. And we'll continue to advance our strategy and grow our capabilities through our productivity and innovation initiatives in order to drive performance under our control and deliver on the evolving needs of our customers, but it doesn't stop with ADM. Our working with other participants across the food and agriculture value chain, from farmers who continue to do more every year to sustainably increase production, to technology providers who offer new ways to make more with less, to governments who in a tight supply and demand environment, should resist the impulse to impose export restrictions. So looking at the balance of the year, when we combine the strategic work we have done to align our portfolio with fundamental global trends with our strong execution and the expectation of a continued tight supply-demand environment, we expect 2022 results to substantially exceed 2021's. And as we look further ahead to a future of increasing needs for more and better foods, we will continue to work to add new adjacent products to address the world's toughest challenges and unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life. Once again, I'd like to thank our colleagues around the globe for their commitment and hard work to serve vital global needs in a challenging and dynamic environment. With that, Emily, please open the line for questions. Good morning, Adam. Yes. Thank you Ben and good morning. Of course, we've been dealing with supply chain issues for a while, and I think that the situation in China has nothing more than just bring back more challenges, if you will. We see the number of ships in congestion, if you will, from Capesize, Panamax, Supramax and Handysize have increased over the last week, increases about 10% give or take depending on the category. So I think that's especially complicated as you see that because of the different conflicts and different shortages in crops that we have, some of these trading flows around the world that are being redirected. So you redirect trading flows with maybe less ship availability and higher freight and longer travel times. So the situation continues to be dire. And that's why it's so important to have a team, a global team, very active with many options to provide supply and then to reach different destinations. So the combination, if you will, of our global trade with the destination marketing and all that becomes more and more important every day for customers around the world. Thank you, Ben. Yes. I would say our first quarter was \u2013 showed strength across the three businesses, very good performance. And as we look at Q2, probably we see the same. There was some reduction in exports in Ag Services in the first quarter because of weather issues and some of that has been moved into the second quarter, so we have a good book there. China has put some orders also for corn Q2 and Q3. We expect the crush profits to continue to be very strong in the second quarter, certainly, refining margins also very good. So I would say demand has been domestically strong for soybean meal in North America and certainly a lot of demand around the world for that. So, we continue to see crush very well supported by the oil and the meal. We continue to see demand for our exports in the second quarter. So had the window of exports of North America, we will have expanded a little bit. And certainly, the refining materials are \u2013 they've maintained very strong margins. If you look at last year, we entered into Q1 with low margins and we ended with strong margins. This year has been strong margins across the quarter and we expect that to continue into the second quarter. Thank you, Tom. Good morning, Ken. Good morning, Ben. Thank you, Ben. Thank you, Ken. Yes. Thank you, Ken. Good question. Listen, when we put the plan in front of shareholders in December, we're just mostly to explain how our company and our business model and portfolio continues to evolve, aligning ourselves with markets of higher growth rates and actually higher margins. And so, what we can control, as you can imagine, is a portfolio, capital allocation and our execution, so we focus on that. So directionally, we're going into that, and we just put a milestone there to have a reference for investors. Of course, at this point in time, we're going to hit those numbers earlier. It is obvious. But I think we don't worry that much of the pace. It's more important for us the direction we're going is higher margins, higher growth rates. The pace sometimes is dictated for outside events in which our team and their execution are supposed to capitalize as much as possible into them. So do you ask me, it's going to be $6 to $7 in 2025, certainly, is going to happen sooner than that. But again, I think it's important to keep the team continue to build that better company with Vikram's explain how we have generated $1.6 billion of cash flow in this, that gives us much more optionality on how much to accelerate that shift of the company into higher margin and higher growth rates. And to be honest, after we have created nutrition and nutrition \u2013 we continue to upgrade targets, even if they make $700 million last year. We are now focusing on building the next scale business. We're looking at microbial solutions and how that will drive the next generation of food and proteins. We are looking at climate solutions or biosolutions, which will drive the next generation of sustainable products and also microbiome modulators, which with the pre, pro and post biotics will drive personalized health and nutrition. And let me remind you and the shareholders, contributions for all these three elements that we're thinking on building was basically muted during the forecast that we showed in the December Global Investor Day. So we feel pretty good about the existing business is delivering $6 to $7 maybe earlier than expected, but we have in the capabilities to build the next scale business for ADM. Thank you, Ken. Good questions as always. Listen, first of all, let me say on that, I'm very proud that our team, and remember, when we announced speeded with, we said we've been looking at that for two years. So we took into considerations, all of these aspects. And so our product remains to be remains on schedule to deliver on the harvest 2023. So most important, what we can control that project is going well and we managing through inflations and delays. So proud of the team there. Listen, at the end of the day, we still expect the significant new capacity will come online. Of course, when there are so many announcements in any industry, you're going to have the percentage of that being coming on a stream. I think that there may be somebody ability on the timing of all that, it doesn't escape anybody that there are labor availability issues, especially in the U.S., certainly raw materials, whether it is a steel or energy or whatever are more expensive than whenever some of these things were announced. And maybe the builders of these hedge, the raw materials exposure to both things in anticipation but I will say, if there is some delay, it may not be bad to allow crush expansions to actually come on a stream. So they can provide the soybean oil for all these plants to run and we also wait for canola to have a path to that. So I think, listen, the industry will develop, it may have some short-term issues here or there, but at the end of the day, a significant piece of new demand for soybean oil is being built and will be built. Thank you, ken. Yes. Listen, it's a very good question. And we look at that, of course, with a lot of attention. I think right now, when we see the capacity coming, it's all capacity needed actually to supply the growth of protein around the world. We see North America with very strong domestic demand for meal, but we see also in North America soybean meal being the most competitive around the world. Especially now, when you have issues in Argentina with some changes in the deal when you have short crops in South America, like we have had and we continue to have a strong demand. We see also that customers are relatively open, so there's not a lot of inventory in the chain that are one point needs to be flushed out. And when you look at, what's happening with feed and competitive feeds, certainly wheat given the conflict in Ukraine, the unfortunate conflict in Ukraine. Wheat prices needs to go up high enough that they get out of the feeding Russians, so they can be preserved to feeding people. When you take that up, you bring corn, the most effective carbohydrate and corn immediately brings soybean meal into the Russian. So we're not only see strong demand, but we see high inclusion rates staying. And again, given the strong leg of soybean oil in North America that will make soybean meal the most competitive in the world. So we actually are very positive about that demand and we think that we need all the expansion to match the market share that soybean meal North America will take from the rest of the world. Yes. Oils have been tied for several months already, if not the year and of course, any announcement in the proximity also of the largest producer of palm oil in the world rattles the markets. Of course, it was immediately clarified that this doesn't include crude palm oil, which is the biggest product. So I would say, I think Indonesia is just trying to take a short-term palliative for their domestic inflation. I don't think it will significantly alter the global balances. Although, the global balance is continue to be very tight and any disruption, we have the Ukrainian disruption of course with and the Russian with sunflower oil so this is an area that everybody has to pay a lot of attention and it will require companies like ADM to having the ability to reformulate, so we can take some customers that our existing customers or either palm oil or sunflower oil to have alternatives to continue to supply their customers. So we are seeing that through our Olenex joint venture, we're seeing that through our Stratas joint venture. So as we've seen the opportunity to add a lot of value to some of the customers that are looking for replacements at this point in time. Sure. Yes, Rob. As I said, I think that we have very strong visibility of course into Q2. I would say further than that, I think customers \u2013 the markets are inverted. So customers see prices relatively high right now, those customers that are not covered, they feel like maybe the course is showing them that they can get covered later at the cheaper rate than today. So I would say, in general, we have coverage for the next quarter, not for Q3 or Q4. But when we look at the demand that we are seeing around the world, we think that when you think about meal and oil, in general, not only North America, but also Brazil. The crush margins need to be there to encourage the crushers to crush. We need the demand for oil and we need the soybean meal. So you will have to have the demand, the crush margins to incentivate people to crush. And we are seeing that with the margins that are happening in Brazil or the U.S. or Europe, all our margins today are higher than what we anticipated. And we think that that's the year rollout and demand continues to be solid out there and strong, crush margins will continue to send that signal to all of our crushers, which is we need the meal, we need the oil keep crushing. Rob, we have \u2013 as part of our global trade group, we have a strong ocean freight group and they work hand in glove to make sure that we continue to serve the customers with the most effective destinations, the most efficient destinations. So we are a big player. And as a big player with a lot of resources, we tend to have a relative advantage to others. So when things get complicated and right now, they are very complicated. We tend to have a relative higher competitive advantage than others. So I think that shows in the margins that we obtained in this. And logistics right now are complicated. They are complicated in the river. They are complicated in the oceans and there is a lot of redrawing of trade flows and you can only redraw a lot of trade flows, if you have a lot of origin options and a lot of destination options, because you need to connect both. And our ocean freight group counts with that blessing, which is ADM originating all the key parts of the world. I have destination units in all key parts of the world. So it provides them with more ability to play supply routes than maybe other players. Yes. Listen, we are paying, of course, close attention to that. At this point in time, we haven't seen any significant impact on demand for us. If you think about so far customers are paying higher prices, but they still, especially in North America, they still haven't changed their behaviors. We think that, of course, if you have disposable income suffering from higher gas prices and higher food prices eventually, they will have to adjust. We have seen more to be honest, Vincent, in the \u2013 some of the emerging markets in which may be food is a bigger percentage of their disposable income. So we have seen some adjustments, a small adjustment in that. But I would say, at this point in time, we have not seen any relevant or material adjustment to our demand. And we think that given the pent-up demand that existed from recovery of the coming out of COVID, people, in general, have been \u2013 having higher saving rates. And we have seen wage inflation around the world that have gotten more money in the pockets of many. So at this point in time, we think consumer has been and demand has been very resilient. But there's going to be a point in which disposable income will get tight and we will see some changes into that. We haven't seen it yet. We don't see it in the immediate future either. Yes. Listen Michael, we haven't seen at this point in time any significant impact to our poultry demand in North America. The numbers at this point in time seems to be about half the size of the issue that was in 2015. So it's something we are following very closely. Of course, but we cannot say that we have an impact so far. And hopefully this virus are difficult to control. So of course, there is a lot of sanitary elements being thrown at that, hopefully, that will placate. But we will have to keep a close eye to them. Yes. On fertilizers, to be honest, Michael, of course, fertilizer supply chains are tight and it's been highly publicized. However, our evidence shows that trade lanes are adopting and markets are getting sufficient supplies of fertilizer. Of course, we had much higher prices that will drive prices for grain. I think today, especially Brazil \u2013 the U.S. certainly have the fertilizer for this crop. So the question is the Brazilian crop, which is coming in a few months. And I think it is still possible what we get from our people in Brazil to get enough potassium fertilizer in country by the planting season. And of course, any shortages can produce production losses. But at this point in time, when people are thinking between maybe 15% or 20% less application at that level, we don't think that we're going to see a significant change in the production forecast. It is probably more depending on the weather at this point in time and rain than fertilizer application. And the second was on food versus fuel. At this point in time, I think that we are committed to try to help the world with food and the environment. So they're both axis of the same equation. I would say, they both touch disposable income that I was saying before, if you get ethanol to reduce the cost of gasoline that creates more disposable income to take on food inflation. If you take \u2013 if you don't put any biofuels into gasoline and you pay more for gasoline, then you may get cheaper food, but you have less disposable income there. So, to be honest, I think the molecules react to the prices that they are given in the market given the different regulations and the different values. Well, we try to be as efficient as possible bring in as much of those \u2013 as many of those molecules to the market as possible to satisfy everybody. So I think at this point in time, we have seen some corrections in certain biofuels mandates across the world. But in other countries, it has been only a reduction and not an elimination. So this \u2013 I think they are short-term things, because we still have the climate crisis, which is a long-term objective that mostly the transportation industry, but also every industry will have to address biofuels, sustainable aviation fuels and all that are a big part of that reduction. Yes. Thank you, Eric. Let me see \u2013 let me tell you how I see this. So last year was a big production year and the world needed to consume more grain than that big production. So the issue is, the world continues to grow and sometimes it's not a matter of population growth, but it's a matter of income. And how people like \u2013 people in China has been an incredible economic improvement of their standards on living that improve their diet, that doesn't go down. So we think that's where we keep on talking about our trend of food security. We will have to provide more for the world. In situations like today, where we are already tight from a supply demand perspective and we will get tighter as demand continues to grow. We see here in ADM that at least we need two very good seasons of crops in North America and South America to actually balance and become more comfortable in those supply-demand balances. When we think about prices today, prices today are going up to mark three things that needs to happen. One is export prices need to go up to being able to draw out all the inventories that are stuck there or they are safe, they are hoarded there to be able to replace the production that we have lost. The production we have lost in South America, but the production we are losing now in the Ukraine and Russia. So first, you need to draw out those inventories and bring them into market. So we can balance ourselves. The second, as I said before, wheat needs to be placed out of the Russians. So you can be preserved for human consumption. And the third one is to give farmers like you, the signal that they need to plant more and I think the world need more acres. Those acres today, they are not going to happen from the Baltic area, they are not going to happen from U.S. that we are basically maxed out. So they may happen in South America. So we need higher prices to bring South American acres, we need higher prices to draw those inventories into the market. And we need two good years of crops, both in North America and South America. That will allow us to balance the supply demand, given the strong demand. Eric, I'm not an economist. But I think there is a narrow path to achieve a soft landing here. And the U.S. economy has been very resilient through all this events. So I think the U.S. economy is driven by the consumer. The consumer has been saving money for two years that they didn't spend a lot. And as I said before, they were COVID recovery packages. But there is also been salary inflations and wages inflation that has put money in the pockets of customers. So I think that for the foreseeable future, we don't see a significant impact of demand. If not, we will be flagging that out, but we look at that, we look at our plans, we are preparing our plans for a long period of the strong demand. We want to run them at high capacity. So at this point in time, I don't see an issue in the west maybe the only flag is how COVID lockdowns evolve in China. But that I don't have a lot of visibility at this point in time. Thank you, Eric. Thank you, Emily. Before we close our call, I wanted to take a minute to thank Ray for his exceptional contribution all this year to ADM's as our CFO. So thank you, Ray. And it's been a pleasure and I'm delighted that you continue with us to continue to help take ADM's a bigger player. Thank you and congratulations, Ray. And, of course, welcome Vikram and this was your baptism of fire here in the earnings call. So thank you very much and welcome to the role and looking forward to it."

            "content": "Thanks, Juan. Slide 7 please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team effectively manage risk and executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment of robust global demand and tight supply, driven primarily by the short South American crop. Ag Services results were significantly higher versus the first quarter of 2021. Global Trade results were higher, driven by strong performances in destination marketing and global ocean freight. North American origination margins and volumes were lower year-over-year, including approximately $75 million in negative timing effects, which will reverse in the coming quarters. Crushing was higher year-over-year in a strong global margin environment, driven by robust protein and vegetable oil demand. Improving margins in the quarter resulted in approximately $60 million in negative timing effects, which will reverse in the coming quarters versus approximately $50 million in positive timing in the prior year quarter. Refined products and other results were much higher than the prior year period, driven by healthy refining premiums and good refined oils demand in North America, as well as strong biodiesel margins in EMEA. Equity earnings from Wilmar were significantly higher versus the first quarter of 2021. Looking ahead, we expect substantially higher Q2 AS&O results than the second quarter of 2021. Slide 8 please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered substantially higher year-over-year results. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment including ethanol production from our wet mills delivered much higher results versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher corn co-product revenues, improved citric acid profits and excellent risk management in North America, higher volumes and margins in EMEA and higher volumes and margins in wheat milling. Sales volumes for starches and sweeteners continued their recovery toward pre-pandemic levels. And as Juan mentioned, our biosolutions platform continue to deliver impressive growth with $55 million in new sales as demand for plant-based products expands into more diverse applications. Vantage corn processes delivered solid execution margins, but position losses on ethanol inventory as prices fell early in the quarter, drove lower results versus the prior year. The prior year quarter's results also benefited from demand for USP-grade industrial alcohol from the Peoria facility, which was divested in Q4 2021. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect the current market dynamics to continue delivering carbohydrate solutions results similar to the very strong second quarter of 2021. On Slide 9, the nutrition business delivered continued strong profit growth. Revenues increased by a very impressive 23%, even when adjusting for currency effects and removing the impacts of recent acquisitions revenue was up by 17%. And while margins have softened somewhat they remain healthy. Human Nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results. Flavors continued to deliver solid revenue growth, offset by some higher costs. Strong sales growth in alternative proteins, including contributions from our Sojaprotein acquisition, and positive currency timing effects in South America, offset some higher operating costs to help deliver better year-over-year results in Specialty Ingredients. Health and wellness results were was also higher year-over-year, powered by continued growth in probiotics, including our late-2021 Deerland Probiotics acquisition, and robust demand for fiber. Animal nutrition profits were nearly double the year-ago period, due primarily to strength in amino acids, driven by a combination of product mix changes, improved North American demand and global supply chain disruptions. Looking ahead, we expect nutrition to deliver as second quarter significantly higher than the prior year period. And with our recent acquisitions delivering ahead of our expectations, we are raising a profit growth outlook for the full year from 15% plus to 20%. Slide 10, please. Let me finish up with a few observations from the Other segment, as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were substantially higher driven primarily by better performance in captive insurance, including reduced claims settlements versus the prior year. Some of the claims settlements that we expected to negatively impact Q1 results are now expected in the second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was higher year-over-year on higher expense for long-term debt, higher short-term borrowings to support working capital needs and interest-related to a tax item. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $209 million were due primarily to higher IT operating and project related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence, partially offset by incentive compensation, accrual adjustments. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was approximately 16%. For the full year, we are now anticipating an effective tax rate at the higher end of our previously guided range of 16% to 19%. Cash flow generation remained strong $1.6 billion before working capital changes versus $1.2 billion in the prior year period. Our balance sheet remained solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 34% and available liquidity of about $9.3 billion, even with almost $3 billion in higher working capital needs since December. With that, I'll turn it back to Juan. Yes, Adam, thanks for the question. Yes, in terms of energy costs, clearly, we are not immune to that and we've seen an elevation in energy costs. As you well know, we have a program to actively hedge our program. So I think to a large degree, we've been successful in doing that. Nevertheless, in places like Europe, where energy costs have been significantly elevated, yes, that's had an impact on net margins. But as you look at the broader dynamics, we continue to see very strong outlook in terms of vegetable demand as well as protein demand. And as you see, most of the grain flows, given what's happening around the world particularly in the Black Sea region and the short South American crop moving to North America that should actually support us in terms of our footprint. So the structural changes associated with RGD remain very much in intact. So we think longer term, we feel very confident about the move higher that we cited in the Global Investor Day in terms of crush margins. And for 2022, in particular, we see even farther \u2013 even more strength, given some of the near-term dynamics I just referenced. Yes, Adam, we clearly view our balance sheet as a competitive advantage. And in terms of capital allocation, we've talked about this before. Our capital allocation is inextricably linked to our strategy. In terms of the guidelines, in terms of the framework, we've articulated about 30% to 40% of our cash flow as we'll direct towards capital expenditures and the remaining 60% to 70% for strategic growth investments. And given our balance sheet flexibility, we are clearly in a position to undertake some of those growth investments, including M&A, if that becomes attractive, but also shareholder distributions, including 30% to 40% towards dividends. As we cited in Global Investor Day, we expect dividend payouts to be actually at the higher end of that 30% to 40% range in the near to medium term. But at the end of the day, if you step back, think about the operating cash flow we generated, $1.6 billion in Q1. So we should be in a position to conduct meaningful buybacks as well in the medium term, as we noted in the Global Investor Day. In the near term, we will repurchase shares to at least offset dilution. Good morning. Well, so as we talked about \u2013 I referenced in my comments, Ben, the revenue growth, right, was 23%. And if you exclude M&A and adjusted for FX, it was 17%, so strong revenue growth frankly across Human Nutrition and Animal Nutrition. The reason our profits were stronger than what we had guided in Q4 were threefold. One is, we did expect some upfront costs that we cited and we had anticipated inflationary cost pressures and supply disruptions. However, with the smart pricing and active supply chain collaboration with our AS&O carb solutions teams, we manage these very well across all the nutrition businesses. The other aspect as we talked about industry-leading win rates in our Global Investor Day, actually our win rates are even expanding beyond that. And the second point is, as you referenced, the OP contribution from our M&A were actually higher than expected. The third point is amino acids. Because of the deliberate switch we mad e from dry to liquid lysine last year, combined with the strong North American protein demand and the supply chain disruptions, our contribution from amino acids business was actually higher. So really, it's a reflection of those three factors that resulted in higher than expected nutrition profit for Q1. Good morning. Thank you so much, Juan."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\nMegan Britt: Hello, and welcome to ADM's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Juan Luciano our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer and Ismael Roig, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks on the call today which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the ADM website and through the link to our webcast. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance, and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risk and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Megan, and good morning to all who have joined for today's call. I realize we're holding this call later than we have in the past and we appreciate your patience as we have managed through our internal investigation and worked expeditiously to complete our 10-K filing. Before we start the business update, I want to provide some perspective on the additional release that we issued this morning on the progress we have made in our internal investigation, which is being led by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. ADM has historically disclosed in the footnotes to our financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. In connection with our internal investigation, we've corrected certain intersegment sales that occurred between our Nutrition reporting segment and our Ag Services & Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. The adjustments have no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statement of earnings, comprehensive income or loss or cash flows. In addition, we determined that the adjustments are not material to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for any period. We also confirmed that these adjustments did not change the achievement levels under our incentive plans. Further detail is included in the Form 10-K we filed this morning. Throughout this process, we have continued to operate the business and drive our strategic priorities forward. While our internal investigation is substantially complete, we continue to cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, and we hope you understand that we will not be taking questions related to these matters on the call today. We will provide updates on this matter in the future as appropriate. Please turn to Slide 4 where we have captured our fourth quarter and full year financial highlights. Today, ADM reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.36, and adjusted segment operating profit of $1.4 billion. Our full year adjusted earnings per share were $6.98, the second best EPS in our history, and our adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 12.2%, making another year of ROIC performance above our 10% target. Our full year operating cash flow before working capital was $4.7 billion. Our strong cash flow and disciplined management of our balance sheet continues to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. In total, we returned $3.7 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases in 2023. In January, with the expectation of continued strong cash flows in 2024, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend, raising our dividend to $0.50 per share, which marks 92 years of uninterrupted dividends and over 51 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. Today, we also announced that our Board has authorized the additional repurchase of up to $2 billion in shares in 2024 under ADM's existing share repurchase program. Our performance for 2023 shows the overall effectiveness of our strategy, where our broad portfolio of business is combined to deliver resilient results for the year. Despite a more challenging operating environment, we maintained strong earnings and ROIC while delivering key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise. Next slide please. To put our 2023 results into perspective, at the end of 2021, we provided a roadmap to create value and growth returns by getting closer to customers and highlighted where we expected to perform on several important strategic metrics by 2025. As I look at our two-year track record over these 2025 objectives, we have delivered adjusted earnings per share at the top end of our $6 to $7 per share EPs objective. We have also continued to deliver ROIC above our 10% target.\nGreen Bison: Let's turn to Slide 6, which I summarize our priorities for value creation in 2024. We continue building a stronger company for the future and to support this, we have identified three key priorities for 2024. One, managing the cycle; two, nutrition recovery; and three, enhanced return of cash to shareholders. Let's take a closer look at each of these areas of focus. We know that 2024 will be a more challenging year that we faced in 2022 and 2023. We see tailwinds that supported a portion of our performance over the past few years changing direction, making our continued progress on our strategic metrics more reliant than ever on our productivity and innovation agenda. In 2024, we will continue to focus on those strategic initiatives that provide strong growth prospects. Our destination marketing efforts continue to bring us closer to our customers and enable us to serve them in a differentiated capacity and we continue to expand. In 2023, we added three new offices across Asia and the Middle East, and in 2024 we plan to add two to four more. Through this ongoing expansion, we expect to achieve 6% growth in our destination market in volumes. Direct farmer buying has been steadily increasing over the past several years and provides ADM an opportunity to maximize value for both sides by creating efficiencies through working directly together. We plan to take this even further in 2024, leveraging our network of more than 200,000 farmer relationships to grow direct origination volumes year-over-year by about 10%. And as our customers strive to decarbonize their own products and services, we are seeing a steady increase in the financial returns generated by our own decarbonization efforts from Regen Ag partnerships to lowering the carbon footprint of our operations. The pace of this is accelerating as we move into 2024. Tied to these strategic initiatives, we continue to build capacity to serve growing customer demand. I mentioned earlier the opening of our Green Bison soy processing facility as well as the expansion of our Marshall, Minnesota starch facility. These capacity additions support growing demand for a wide variety of sustainable products and solutions, from renewable fuels to industrial products. And connected to our productivity efforts, we have formally launched a 2024 program we call the Drive for Execution Excellence within the organization. Over the years, we have consistently encouraged our ADM colleagues to identify and execute both cost saving and cash generation ideas. We've developed processes and systems through our prior transformation programs and now those are ramping up for another cycle. As part of this, we have already commissioned more than 300 projects and plan to see $500 million in traceable cost savings over the next two years across all aspects of our enterprise, from operations to supply chain to corporate costs. Now let's discuss our plans within the Nutrition business. We're calling this section, of course, nutrition recovery for a reason. Nutrition had a very difficult year with results well below our expectations, and we have been working aggressively to change this and return to growth. For Nutrition, 2023 representing a combination of challenging market forces, some specific non-recurring events and some misses on demand fulfillment. And while market forces such as customer destocking as well as softer demand for plant-based proteins are not within our control, we're already taking action on the areas we can improve. Many of the supply issues are the result of the complexity built into the Nutrition business over time. In our zeal to meet our customers' needs, we have created one of the strongest pantries in the industry. This added complexity in our operations and supply chain that at times impacted our ability to efficiently fulfill demand. To address this, we have made important changes to drive simplification across the Nutrition business that will ease the pressure on our overall supply chain and dramatically improve our demand fulfillment performance. First, we have created a stronger division of duty across operations leadership and added new leaders with a strong expertise in supply chain management. We have also taken steps to build our COE expertise back into the core business, helping make our overall supply chain capabilities more agile and responsive to commercial demand signals. We have also engaged third party experts to help identify further opportunities for operational excellence improvements across our largest facilities. We have also greatly simplified the product and production line landscape to further achieve operational and supply efficiency, reducing the brands we are presenting to customers by two thirds and downsizing about 17% of our SKUs alongside the strategic production line simplification. A recent example of this is the closure of more than 20 Animal Nutrition production lines in 2023, now better serving the product mix and supply chain efficiency of the business. We're also optimizing our Nutrition business portfolio, leveraging our experience in both large scale and bolt-on acquisitions. We have enhanced our approach to M&A integration to increase value creation as we focus more on the integration of recent acquisitions than new targets. We continue to assess our portfolio for a strategic fit, making surgical decisions to achieve the returns targets we expect. For example, during Q4, we took action on two JVs that were not expected to meet our returns criteria. We're proud to see how the team with new leadership has rallied around this recovery plan, which is already showing signs of improvement as we move through the first quarter of the year. Recent trends suggest that destocking impacts in beverages are subsiding and we are well positioned to capture recovering demand in 2024 as evidenced by the strong demand we are seeing in flavors. After heightening our operational efficiency, we've seen steady increases in shipping volumes and productions throughout the course of the last month. And in Animal Nutrition, we have seen another quarter of sequential improvement in the base of the business, which excludes amino acids and pet solutions and early indications in the first quarter of 2024 suggest that this will continue. Importantly, our nutrition value proposition continues to be well received by customers as evidenced by our robust opportunity pipeline and industry leading win rates across key categories like flavors, dietary supplements and pep. ADM's customer centricity and agile innovation capabilities, supported through our creation, design and development expertise, differentiates us. We continue to believe that Nutrition has an important role in ADM's integrated business model. Beyond adding value to the ingredients produced by our AS&O and carbohydrate solution businesses, Nutrition is innovating to address evolving consumer needs and is connecting us more closely with a growing customer base. Finally, I'll turn attention to the capital allocation strategy that continues to guide our strategic cash deployment decisions. As noted, we announced today that the Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion in shares through the remainder of the year, including $1 billion in shares to be executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical. This will total $6.4 billion in repurchases executed since 2022 and coupled with the already announced 11% dividend growth, this is aligned with our commitment to a balanced capital allocation approach. So, combined, we believe these three areas of focus set ADM to perform well in a challenging external operating environment in 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Ismael for more detail on the results of the operations. Ishmael?\nIsmael Roig: Thank you, Juan. Let's start on Slide 7 which provides overall segment operating income and EPS for 2023. Overall, we delivered the second highest earnings in company history, overcoming a challenging operating environment. Adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion for the full year, a 6% decrease versus the prior year. At a high level, operating profit was primarily down year-over-year in Ag Services & Oilseeds and Nutrition. In the other segment, which includes ADMIS and Captive Insurance, we had a significant increase in operating profit. Adjusted earnings per share were $6.98 for the year. Improved pricing in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition, as well as positive impacts from mark to market timing in AS&O more than offset the impact of lower crush margins, leading to a $0.70 per share improvement versus the prior year. Volume improvement in AS&O was more than offset by volume declines in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition, resulting in a $0.29 per share reduction in EPS versus the prior year. Higher manufacturing costs partially related to unplanned downtime at the Decatur complex led to a $0.41 per share decrease versus the prior year. And lower equity earnings primarily related to Wilmar attributed a $0.46 per share decrease versus the prior year. Increased corporate costs related to higher interest rates and the 1ADM implementation partially offset by higher ADMIS results drove a $0.30 per share versus the prior year. For other, benefits from share repurchases were more than offset by negative impacts related to a higher adjusted income tax rate and cycling one-time benefits from the Legal Recovery and Biofuel Producer Recovery program, leading to a $0.18 per share decrease versus the prior year. Moving to Slide 8, let's look at our segment performance for AS&O. For the full year, AS&O delivered $4.1 billion in segment operating profit, 8% lower than the record level in 2022. Ag Services segment operating profit was 15% lower versus the prior year as reduced origination volume and margins in North America were partially offset by record South American origination volumes. In global trade, destabilization of trade flows led to lower results compared to an exceptional 2022. Crushing segment operating profit for the full year was $346 million lower versus the prior year as improved process volumes were more than offset by lower crush margins and higher manufacturing costs. Refined Products and Other results were $469 million higher, resulting in a record year. Results were driven by higher volumes and margins in biodiesel. Market volatility drove positive timing impacts of approximately $235 million, compared to negative timing impacts of $90 million in the prior year. Equity earnings for Wilmar were $303 million in 2023, approximately 45% lower than the prior year. Now let's move to Slide 9 and look at Carbohydrate Solutions. For the full year Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit was $1.4 billion 3% lower versus the record prior year. In the Starches and Sweeteners segment higher pricing and mix were offset by weaker volumes and lower corn co-product values. The teams executed well in a dynamic environment, posting a record year in Wheat Milling. In Vantage Corn Processing strong exports and steady domestic demand and blending rates supported ethanol production and robust margins. The prior year also included onetime benefits of $50 million related to the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery program. We also continue to make significant progress on our BioSolutions strategic initiative, delivering revenue growth well ahead of our 15% plus target. Please now turn to Slide 10. In Nutrition, revenues of $7.2 billion for the full year were 6% lower versus the prior year. Demand headwinds and destocking impacts, coupled with operational challenges related to the ERP systems integration pressured volumes. This more than offset price and mixed benefits as well as positive currency impacts. In Human Nutrition volumes declined due to lower market demand for plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages, and operational challenges related to the ERP system implantation. This was partially offset by improved price and mix in flavors and texture and pricing in specialty ingredients. In Animal Nutrition, lower complete feed and premix volumes, the normalization of amino acid markets and demand fulfillment challenges in Pet Solutions led to lower revenue versus 2022. Now please turn to Slide 11. For the full year Nutrition segment operating profit was $427 million, 36% lower versus the prior year. Human Nutrition results of $417 million were 25% lower than the prior year as weaker volumes as well as increased costs related to operational challenges from the ERP implementation and unplanned Decatur downtime at Decatur East were partially offset by higher pricing. Animal nutrition results of $10 million were 91% lower compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower volumes and the normalization of amino acid pricing. When bridging from 2022, our performance can be characterized in three buckets, market forces, one-time items, and operational challenges. Market forces accounted for a majority of the deterioration in 2023 and as previously mentioned, this was mostly related to lower demand and plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages and lower premix and completely demand which impacted volumes across the industry.\nSAVAN: Lastly, we also had our own operation struggles that impacted our ability to deliver on the strong demand that we have created. The implementation of ERP systems over the course of the year led to complications in shipping and producing products, negatively impacting both volumes and manufacturing costs. Over the past month, we have seen a steady improvement in operations and are confident that we will see volumes lost in 2023 come back in 2024. Now please turn to Slide 12. For the full year Other segment operating profit was $375 million, up 125% compared to the prior year. ADM Investor Services results improved on higher net interest income. Higher Captive Insurance results on new program premiums were partially offset by higher claim losses. In corporate for the full year, net interest expense increased year-over-year on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate cost increased versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support digital transformation efforts. Other corporate was unfavorable compared to the prior year due to one-time investment valuation losses of approximately $57 million. Please turn to Slide 13. Over the last two years the company has generated significant cash flow that have bolstered our balance sheet and provided us with financial flexibility to drive long-term growth. In 2023 we again had strong cash flow of $4.7 billion which were actualized in line with our balanced capital allocation framework. 30% or approximately $1.5 billion of cash flows were reinvested in the business to support growth and modernize our assets, including investments in new capacity and the digitization of our existing asset footprint. Our cash flows also supported significant capital return in 2023 with nearly 30% earnings going to dividends and nearly 60% of cash flows or about $2.7 billion going to shareholders via share repurchases. In 2024 we expect to hold capital expenditures to a level aligned with depreciation and amortization with focus spend around the safety and reliability of assets. We also intend to manage working capital needs prudently limiting M&A beyond previously announced transactions and focusing our team on cost savings and cash generation initiatives through the drive for Execution Excellence. As Juan mentioned earlier, our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will remain focused around the shareholder. We finished the year with strong momentum in terms of returning cash, repurchasing nearly 1.6 billion of shares in Q4 and nearly 330 million of shares so far in Q1. Over the course of the year, we intend to actualize 2 billion of additional share repurchases, with 1 billion being executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical. Now, let's transition to a discussion of guidance for 2024 on Slide 14 please. In 2024, global grain and oil seed supply is expected to increase as anticipated improvements in weather should support larger production levels in key South American countries. Assuming commodity prices ease for recent highs and trade flows adjust to the dislocations created over the past two years, we anticipate global soybean crush margins will moderate in 2024, likely moving into a range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton. From the demand side, we continue to expect vegetable oil demand growth from renewable diesel and low single digit soybean mill demand growth to support structural margin improvement. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.25 per share to $6.25 per share, representing an 18% decline from prior year at the midpoint. Now breaking down our expectations by segment for 2024, let's turn to Slide 15. In AS&O, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower and the full year to also be lower versus comparable prior periods as increased global commodity supply and normalization of margins will weigh on the segment. We anticipate global soy crush margins within the range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton as the market balances better soybean availability against increased crush and renewable diesel capacity. Our Operational Excellence efforts and the ramp up of our Green Bison facility should lead to mid-to-high single digit improvement in our process volumes. We expect significantly lower biodiesel margins in 2023, timing gains to reverse as contracts are executed. In Carbohydrate Solutions, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower versus the prior year. For the full year, we anticipate another strong year, but slightly lower than 2023 as the improved volumes and margins in Sweeteners and Starches could be offset by weaker ethanol. For nutrition, the first quarter is expected to be lower versus the prior year as we face headwinds from a normalizing texturants market, fixed costs associated with operational challenges related to the Decatur East and protein volumes. However, for the full year we expect Nutrition to begin its path to recovery. We anticipate conversion of our significant pipeline opportunities in Human and Animal Nutrition to yield mid-single-digit revenue growth. We assume market normalization in texturants to be a headwind in 2024. We do not anticipate the significant one-time events of 2023 to recur. Back to you, Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ismael. Please turn to Slide 16. In summary, let me once again share the three priorities for our year ahead. We will continue our efforts across the business to drive our productivity and innovation portfolio of projects, taking advantage of capacity gains we have made and ensure that our teams are generating and executing on our drive for Execution Excellence. We continue to take aggressive actions in the nutrition business to ensure that it can deliver on the areas of growth that we have continued to build into our opportunity pipeline. This includes supporting the operational changes we have introduced, driving simplifications through our products and brands, and ensuring that our business portfolio is tuned to best achieve our return expectations. And we're also actively managing our balanced capital allocation strategy, both prudently investing in the business while growing our dividends and accelerating our share repurchase program to return more to shareholders in the near-term. I believe strongly in the powerful role ADM plays as a leader in the agriculture supply chain, and that our ability to bring partners together across the value chain will be critical to driving future transformation in the food, feed, fuel and industrial markets we serve. I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness. I'm confident in our ability to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pave a path for long-term profit growth. Operator, please open the line for questions now.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam, the line is yours.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Adam. How are you?\nAdam Samuelson: Good morning. Good. So I guess my question is really around framing the go-forward outlook in terms of the cyclical versus the pieces that ADM controls. And you had the targets from the 2021 Investor Day still on the slides of returns and earnings per share. The outperformance the last couple of years has been largely cyclically driven in AS&O, whereas some of the investments and the items under your own control, particularly Nutrition, have not performed up to expectations. As we think about 2024 that's at least the cyclical parts are reversing, at least in part. Can you Juan put a little bit more finer point on how you think about 2024 versus normalized earnings for the business and maybe quantify the path forward in Nutrition beyond this year as you work to earn a return on the substantial investments you've actually made in that business?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Adam. So let's take each of the businesses in the portfolio. So when we think about Ag Services and Oilseeds, as you said, we had a spectacular performance over the last couple of years, taking full advantage of the opportunities in the market. But we forecasted in 2021 that margins were going to moderate, although they were going to stay higher than historical averages and we are seeing that. We see the moderation and we see even crush margins, 35 to 60, that we are forecasting are higher than average. We have not stayed quiet waiting for the cycle to reverse. We have been adjusting our business model. You heard me saying about destination marketing, something we didn't have a few years ago, and we continue to grow that. That gives us extra margins and now we are forecasting that we continue to expand and we're going to grow those volumes 6% this year and that programs continue as we expand into new geographies in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. When you think also about the Regen program, Regen AG program that we have with our customers, we are helping our CPG customers with their Scope 3 emissions and we are working together with the farmers and that program is the leading program in the industry and continues to grow. We are also doing everything in the value chain. We're looking at farmer direct. That's an ability for us to get efficiencies between us and the producer, the way we buy grain. So of course, we get an advantage with that as the producer as well. And we're planning to increase our volumes 10%, leveraging on the 200,000 farmer relationships we have around the world. Of course, we have expanded capacity. We are expanding crush in Latin America. We are expanding crush in North America with Spiritwood. So I would say when you take that, plus our operational improvements, if you will, what we call the push for excellence, that was going to be the productivity and innovation agenda that were going to help us navigate through this. We see 2024 still as a strong year for Ag Services and Oilseeds, it's going to be lower, but it's still going to be a strong year. Of course, the market has priced a lot of the extra capacity and the higher argentine crop into the crush margins. But we still see the ability of the market to absorb all that capacity with a strong mill growth and with a strong demand for oils. So that on the Ag Services and Oilseeds side. On the Carb Solutions side, this business has been very stable over the last few years. It has had a very good 2022 and 2023. We are expecting a very good 2024, maybe slightly lower, but still very, very good. We had a good program for good contract renewals in 2024. We are happy with the margins. We have maintained margins for the most part, and we have gained some volumes, so volumes are strong. The milling business has been going, had a record year last year, and it continues to drive very strong. I think both businesses have a little bit of a lower contribution from feed products, where margins have decreased a little bit, but BioSolutions, as Ismael mentioned, continues to grow, is growing beyond 15% per year. And all their decarbonization things that we're saying, we see more and more demand for everything that carb solutions can bring to the table in that area. So we feel very good about that. Always the question mark in the year maybe is ethanol, but we're seeing right now, Adam, ethanol, the arbitrage to export from the U.S. is open to everywhere in the world. So it's just a matter of adjusting our capacity and the U.S. capacity to get more dehydrated ethanol, if you will, to be able to export, to adjust the humidity content, if you will. So, I think we'd export well north of maybe 1.5, 1.6 billion gallons for this year. That should bode well for recovery of margins as we go into the year. And then you take nutrition. Nutrition has been a growth story for many years, and we certainly stumbled in 2023. I mentioned some of the reasons. Some of the reasons were, there was a big destocking after all the COVID and all the supply chain issues that the industry have, the industry stopped. And now we went through lower inflation and this talking about that. So we had to go that in beverages, which drives flavors, which is our biggest engine for growth, if you will. Of course, we knew into the year that plant-based proteins, we have moderated our expectations for growth on that will still grow, but it's not going to be beyond 10%. So it's still going to be an attractive mid-single-digit growth, if you will. But we knew that, and then we had continued growth in continued good demand in pet and health and wellness and Animal Nutrition has been improving their P&L, doing a lot of self-help from the June P&L. It's been improving all the year. So unfortunately we get to the Q4 and we had several events in Q4. We have several one offs. We needed to take action on a couple of joint ventures and we addressed that. We needed to take a revaluation of an investment because of the end evaluation and we took that in the Q4. And then we have some issues on our own performance that we needed to implement 1ADM as much as we prepared for that. We had some problems with some of the modules. It was a successful implementation, but some of the modules that were about shipping products gave us trouble during the last quarter of the year. So when you have all that combination, it gave us a very bad quarter. We continue to see 2024 a year of growth or recovery, if you will, from the 2023 value. And from there, we should continue to march on our commitment to nutrition. Our ability to fulfill or to deliver a value proposition that resonates with customers continue to be evidenced by our growing pipeline, both in Animal and Human Nutrition, and our conversion rate we have benchmarked this is industry leading conversion rate. So we know we are winning. We need to adjust our own internal processes to make sure we deliver that. And we have done that heavily in the last -- second half of last year, and we have seen that during January and February that we are delivering much better than we did last year. So with that, I still look confident at the numbers, at the overall number for the company that we gave you for 2025. As I said on the onset, we are ahead on what we scheduled. From an EPS perspective, we are above 10% in ROIC and we have purchased already more than the $5 billion of share that we have estimated for 2025. So it's never going to be a straight line from here to 2025. But we have a resilient portfolio that can help us see that those numbers for the overall portfolio are still possible, as it was in December 2021. Sorry for the long answer. It's a large company.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of Citi. Tom, please go ahead.\nTom Palmer: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to dig in a bit more on crush margins and your $35 to $60 global soybean crush outlook. Maybe just to frame it, where were global crush margins last year? Where are crush margins currently? When we consider different regions of the world, and then as we think about the items that could drive to the upper or lower end of this year's range, what are kind of the key items you're looking at? Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, thank you, Tom. So, as we said before, Ismael mentioning his remarks, we expect crush margins between $35 to $60 for this year, they were about $70 per ton, maybe last year. I think it's fair to say that the market has completely priced or baked all the bad news into the crush margins are we having today? So, I would say board crush has moved significantly lower in the last month as the market probably gained more confidence in the availability of products, especially soybean meal, particularly when you think about Argentina now having sites on a crop that may be 50 million tons. And the U.S. crush industry also has performed very well. And the market continued to look forward to the second quarter of the year when they're going to have basically three offers for meal. That hasn't happened last year. So if you remember, last year, after Brazil finished in exporting, the U.S. became the only global, only gaming town, if you will. And that increased soybean meal values around the world, which makes soybean meal expensive, if you will for the Russian. We see that in the U.S., we saw, at least for ADM, we saw five consecutive months of record exports for soybean meal in the U.S. And the U.S. industry saw similar situation. So now with the correction in this, we expect that soybean meal will gain back into the Russians. Of course, feeding with meat pros and not soybean milk is not the optimal way to feed. So now that soybean milk has corrected, we expect that to happen. At the end of the day, Tom, the way I think about where crush is going to happen in the world is going to happen in both places where you have bean availability and where you have a domestic oil market. If you think of Brazil, Brazil is having B14 started in March. And that has helped with the margins of domestic oil for us in Brazil. And of course, you have a big crop, so you're going to have the bean availability and the domestic market. And then it will be the U.S. in which you have all the need of soybean oil to go into renewable green diesel and biodiesel and we have, of course, the bin availability. So we think that crush will favor those two places.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO. Andrew, please go ahead.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess ultimately, my question is about 2025 and whether you view 2024 as kind of the trough here from an earnings perspective in terms of the cycle. And if I just follow up on maybe you made some comments at the end of the response to Adam about 2025. I didn't know if that was specific to the metrics around nutrition or the prior earnings guidance that you had talked about. If you could just kind of clarify the way that you're thinking about that is this 2024 an earnings number from, which you would expect to grow, and then the 2025 comments with that. Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Andrew, first of all, my comment before to Tom's question was the overall number that we gave for the company for 2025 in 2021. We still believe that number is there. I think that that number was never going to be a destination for ADM, was a milestone, if you will. And as we are reviewing our five-year plan that we do every year we see us breaking through that number. So in that sense, I expect 2024 to be a down year versus 2023 hopefully 2025 will be a positive year versus 2024. There is a cycle here that needs to happen, Andrew, that I described below, soybean mill will get cheaper. All the oil activities related to B-14 or RGD needs to grow. All that needs to happen and how long that adjustment takes, how long it takes for meal to be low enough to increase demand and for flat prices to be low enough to maybe make the farmer correct a little bit. They are planting all that process we know historically happens, when exactly it's going to happen. Does it happen in a calendar year? Doesn't happen in six months. Does it happen in a year is hard to say. But we continue to build a company that has more optionality, that's more resilience for the future. So as the cycle moderates, we continue to have more ability to bring more to the P&L. So we think with that, I'm optimistic about 2025 being better than 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Ben, the line is yours.\nBen Bienvenu: Good morning.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: Juan, I want to ask, as we think about the morning, I want to ask as we think about 2024 for the nutrition segment, you note that you expect mid-single digit revenue growth, operating profit to be higher over year. I think the natural inference would be that the operating profit growth is up by less than 5% or mid-single digit revenue growth. Is that true? And then as you referenced in kind of the cadence and your expectations for the first quarter, this is a trajectory of recovery that will build throughout the year in 2024. You talk about pipeline conversion. Are there residual headwinds, discontinuities from the Decatur complex still in the first quarter? Help us think through the sequencing of the development of return to growth and nutrition.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, good question, Ben. Let me give you the puts and takes, if you will, on nutrition as we look at 2024. So as Ismael said in his remarks, about half of the headwinds that we faced last year were market. That means that half of them were in the other two buckets, the non-recurring events, if you will, and those by nature we hope that we're not going to have going forward. And I think Ismael qualified them about $60 million something give or take. And then the other ones were like some of the demand fulfillment issues that I explained how we have worked aggressively to correct. And we have seen good indication of that over the first two months of this year. So I would say those are the positive that we don't expect all that to happen again in 2024. You put on top of that a single digit revenue growth, mid-single digit revenue growth because of the pipeline that we have and the conversion of that pipeline. And that tends to happen every year. Then, as you described, we have to have to face a correction of texturizing prices that were exceptionally high last year. We're not going to have that. So that will be part of the negative side, if you will. And certainly, as we go through the year, we still need to bring Decatur East plant back into operations, and that will have a tail of a cost. So I would say the year will be driven by a strong recovery in Animal Nutrition, in flavors, and hopefully pet with some tailwinds in the specialty ingredients. That's how we see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Ben, please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Yes. Good morning and thank you very much for taking my question. Juan, Ismael wanted to follow-up on carbohydrate solutions because that obviously, as you've highlighted, has been a very solid performer last year. Even the outlook looks very promising still in comparison to maybe some of the other segments for 2024. And I wanted to understand where you are within your different asset bases, be it on the ethanol side, but also particularly Starches and Sweeteners for the need to invest into the business. Where are you in terms of capacity and what do you need to potentially allocate money to in order to keep that business up where it is, or potentially further grow it as it has gained significance within the consolidated ADM results? Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, Ben, I'm glad you're highlighting carb solution. They had a spectacular year. They deserve recognition and they've done a fantastic job of transforming their business into a very resilient and stable business. The assets let me take it by pieces. The milling business. Milling is an old business that has some old assets. And over the last few years, we have been doing -- the team has been doing a terrific job of shutting down some assets and consolidating those in new facilities like Mendota that we launched last year. That is the best and the newest wheat milling plant in the world. So we are happy with the way they have done that. They continue to do so. So that business is in good shape. When we look at the wet mills, we continue to invest in part of the wet mills. Unlikely that we're going to build a new wet mill, as you can understand, but that business continue to be reinvested in. It's a business that is a large business has a large asset footprint. And at the moment there is a lot of capital being associated with the path to decarbonize all these assets. So as you heard, we have a lot of efforts in trying to get pipelines to try to monetize some of our CO2 that come from the biogenic CO2 that come from the ethanol plants. So and I would say we have expanded Marshall because BioSolutions is growing at north of 15% per year. So we needed capacity. So the Marshall expansion is about 50% expansion to the final starch capacity that we have there. And that will help a lot with that. I would say the year is exciting as it is developing. It has solid margins. It has so far solid volumes. It had a little bit of a rough January because of the bad weather. We have ice in the plants and freezing weather. But February, March, things look good. And we think that that business has the opportunity to get some tailwinds from lower energy cost and maybe chemicals cost as the year go by. And that's a big energy hog, that business. So that could be an advantage and a tailwind coming later in the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta of UBS. Manav, please go ahead.\nManav Gupta: Thank you. I just had a quick question. When we look at the carb, recent proposals and then we look at the 45g, it looks both at the federal level and at certain state levels there is a desire to lower the amount of renewable diesel being produced from vegetable oil. And I'm just trying to understand, do you see that as some kind of a headwind whereby eventually the demand for soybean oil from the renewable diesel or biodiesel industry could actually decline versus what we are seeing or you think this is just passing and the demand eventually will rise again as we move along?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Manav, for the question. Listen, I think the path is clear for RGD, that RGD will need vegetable oils. When you think about how Europe is doing, Europe not having a raw crop for that, Europe needs cooking oil, waste oils, and they will capture that. The U.S. will have to be fed with soybean oil, canola oil. And we see that commitment to be firm over the years. All these capacities being built, it cannot be filled with anything else. So we feel that is a strong trend ahead of us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano of Bank of America. Salvator, please go ahead.\nSalvator Tiano: Yes, thank you very much. I just want to go back to the 2025 target of $6, $7 in EPS. I mean, that is obviously double digit EPS growth and I understand buybacks play a role into that. But given the comments about controllables versus cyclicals, it seems really tough to imagine getting back there. Can you provide a little bit some of the key components and key buckets that you think will get you there in terms of its segment and specific numbers as detailed as possible?\nIsmael Roig: Yes, Salvator listen, a little bit of what I explained early on Adam's question. I think that we will see how the cycle plays in ASNO. As I said, I think that lower prices have this ability to incentivate demand. At this point in time If you think about soybean meal demand, we are forecasting a very strong soybean meal demand, maybe higher than USDA levels, higher than GDP. When you think about Southeast Asian economies recovering and with inflation moderating, purchasing power is improving, tourism is improving in all those areas, you have at the moment very high prices of beef that's favoring pork and chicken. You have protein margins for chicken being better at that. So we think that soybean meal will gain in the Russian. So when we look at all that, we see the soy oil demand very strong in domestic consumption, but also for biofuels, and then we see the meal demand very strong. We think that this correction should be probably short term for crash and that should come back again. I cannot make a prediction on the timing of that, but we know how the cycle plays. So whether it's calendar year this or six months later or a quarter earlier, it's not for me to venture into those guesses. I think that carb solutions between the exceptional job they are doing on managing their mature businesses and the growth that they are getting through decarbonization and BioSolutions, you will see that ahead of us. Again, we just bring in the Marshall expansion. That's not something that it was in our forecast last year. So we're going to have it more in the next three quarters, if you will, of the year, Spiritwood again, and some of the crash capacity we brought in Brazil, and then you see nutrition. That nutrition was not a contributor, certainly a big contributor to growth in 2023, but we expect it to be back to growth in 2024 and 2025. So those are kind of the buckets, if you will, that I see at the moment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley. Steven, the line is yours.\nSteven Haynes: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to come back to nutrition, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about some portfolio refreshment going on there and was wondering if you could maybe size, the scope of that. Are you thinking more kind of product line oriented here, or is this kind of more at the business level where you might be looking to monetize something? Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, Steven, listen, let me give you my thinking on that and the way we approach these things. So we always look, every time we do our five year plan, we take a look at those units that whether they are not returning, given our return expectations to date, we're not forecasting it to do it in the medium term. And those are the ones that we tend to take action. So we took action with a couple of joint ventures, as I mentioned, and then we look at every unit that is underperforming. What we do first is we try to bring them to performance. So we make sure that if there are some things that are self-inflicted, if you will, we correct those things. Once we correct those things, and then we have visibility to what could happen over the next two or three years, then we decide as a part of portfolio whether they belong in nutrition or they belong in another part of ADM, or they belong outside ADM. So that's a regular process. We done, we done it in the past with fertilizers, Latin America, we've done it in the past. We divested Bolivia. We divested cocoa and chocolate. So we've done this, and now we've done it with a couple of joint ventures. We've done it also. Ismael has done it in his previous job as an Animal Nutrition leader with some of the lines in Animal Nutrition that we cut, like 20 lines around the world. So sometimes we have exited countries. So it's a regular process that at times, maybe when you have a stumble like we had in nutrition, you look a little bit deeper, because now, all of a sudden, you have more businesses at lower performance. So we really want to see, is it worth investing in some of those? So we're in that process. So, nothing to announce today, but we continue to look at that very deeply.\nIsmael Roig: Just a couple of complimentary comments, because not only have we had some experience historically, as Juan correctly mentions, with [indiscernible] and fertilizer, but certainly the Animal Nutrition was a good precursor to some of the thinking that we have now in mind for the whole of our nutrition business. In the sense that usually when you acquire these businesses, they come with footprint allocations, labs, farms, in our cases, and warehouses, that when you aggregate them, start aggregate them across a number of different acquisitions, you realize that there are overlaps. And what we noticed is that there was a significant opportunity in Animal Nutrition to significantly simplify the portfolio by reducing the number of labs, reducing the number of SKUs of plants. And we've seen those benefits. They've been occurring since the second half of 2023. And I think that some of that thinking, as we have built this organization via a multiplicity of acquisitions, lends itself now to a pause and reflection, in light of the successes that we've had with this, to apply it more broadly to all of the portfolio. So that's where our capital prudence is going to come in, by focusing on ensuring that we improve our asset base while returning cash to our shareholders.\nSteven Haynes: Thank you, Ismael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dushyant Ailani of Jefferies. Dushyant, please go ahead.\nDushyant Ailani: Thank you for squeezing me in. I just wanted to quickly talk about biodiesel margins going forward. Your thoughts just around the system, both in the U.S. and internationally, just how do we frame our thoughts around that and capacity as well?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Dushyant. Well, all useful biofuel production is, as I said, is expected to grow in Brazil. We're going to go to B14, so there are many countries that are increasing their mandates, whether it's Indonesia and all that. When you look at the overall balances around the world, you see plantations in Southeast Asia getting older, the trees getting older, so maybe less production of palm oil. So you're going to see biodiesel mandates increasing around the world and less competitive pressure, if you will, for palm oil. So you're going to see the pressure on vegetable oil. So we think that that will continue to be a strong leg of the crash, biodiesel in particular. Biodiesel margins are better right now for us in Europe. They have moderated significantly in the U.S., and we expect them to be good, but not as good as they used to be in the U.S. So that will be a little bit of a headwind for us in 2024. But margins are better in Brazil and in Europe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. With that, we have no further questions, so I'll hand back to the management team for any closing remarks.\nMegan Britt: Thank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up with me, if you have any other questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan, and good morning to all who have joined for today's call. I realize we're holding this call later than we have in the past and we appreciate your patience as we have managed through our internal investigation and worked expeditiously to complete our 10-K filing. Before we start the business update, I want to provide some perspective on the additional release that we issued this morning on the progress we have made in our internal investigation, which is being led by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. ADM has historically disclosed in the footnotes to our financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. In connection with our internal investigation, we've corrected certain intersegment sales that occurred between our Nutrition reporting segment and our Ag Services & Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. The adjustments have no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statement of earnings, comprehensive income or loss or cash flows. In addition, we determined that the adjustments are not material to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for any period. We also confirmed that these adjustments did not change the achievement levels under our incentive plans. Further detail is included in the Form 10-K we filed this morning. Throughout this process, we have continued to operate the business and drive our strategic priorities forward. While our internal investigation is substantially complete, we continue to cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, and we hope you understand that we will not be taking questions related to these matters on the call today. We will provide updates on this matter in the future as appropriate. Please turn to Slide 4 where we have captured our fourth quarter and full year financial highlights. Today, ADM reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.36, and adjusted segment operating profit of $1.4 billion. Our full year adjusted earnings per share were $6.98, the second best EPS in our history, and our adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 12.2%, making another year of ROIC performance above our 10% target. Our full year operating cash flow before working capital was $4.7 billion. Our strong cash flow and disciplined management of our balance sheet continues to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. In total, we returned $3.7 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases in 2023. In January, with the expectation of continued strong cash flows in 2024, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend, raising our dividend to $0.50 per share, which marks 92 years of uninterrupted dividends and over 51 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. Today, we also announced that our Board has authorized the additional repurchase of up to $2 billion in shares in 2024 under ADM's existing share repurchase program. Our performance for 2023 shows the overall effectiveness of our strategy, where our broad portfolio of business is combined to deliver resilient results for the year. Despite a more challenging operating environment, we maintained strong earnings and ROIC while delivering key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise. Next slide please. To put our 2023 results into perspective, at the end of 2021, we provided a roadmap to create value and growth returns by getting closer to customers and highlighted where we expected to perform on several important strategic metrics by 2025. As I look at our two-year track record over these 2025 objectives, we have delivered adjusted earnings per share at the top end of our $6 to $7 per share EPs objective. We have also continued to deliver ROIC above our 10% target. Thank you, Ismael. Please turn to Slide 16. In summary, let me once again share the three priorities for our year ahead. We will continue our efforts across the business to drive our productivity and innovation portfolio of projects, taking advantage of capacity gains we have made and ensure that our teams are generating and executing on our drive for Execution Excellence. We continue to take aggressive actions in the nutrition business to ensure that it can deliver on the areas of growth that we have continued to build into our opportunity pipeline. This includes supporting the operational changes we have introduced, driving simplifications through our products and brands, and ensuring that our business portfolio is tuned to best achieve our return expectations. And we're also actively managing our balanced capital allocation strategy, both prudently investing in the business while growing our dividends and accelerating our share repurchase program to return more to shareholders in the near-term. I believe strongly in the powerful role ADM plays as a leader in the agriculture supply chain, and that our ability to bring partners together across the value chain will be critical to driving future transformation in the food, feed, fuel and industrial markets we serve. I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness. I'm confident in our ability to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pave a path for long-term profit growth. Operator, please open the line for questions now. Good morning, Adam. How are you? Yes. Thank you, Adam. So let's take each of the businesses in the portfolio. So when we think about Ag Services and Oilseeds, as you said, we had a spectacular performance over the last couple of years, taking full advantage of the opportunities in the market. But we forecasted in 2021 that margins were going to moderate, although they were going to stay higher than historical averages and we are seeing that. We see the moderation and we see even crush margins, 35 to 60, that we are forecasting are higher than average. We have not stayed quiet waiting for the cycle to reverse. We have been adjusting our business model. You heard me saying about destination marketing, something we didn't have a few years ago, and we continue to grow that. That gives us extra margins and now we are forecasting that we continue to expand and we're going to grow those volumes 6% this year and that programs continue as we expand into new geographies in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. When you think also about the Regen program, Regen AG program that we have with our customers, we are helping our CPG customers with their Scope 3 emissions and we are working together with the farmers and that program is the leading program in the industry and continues to grow. We are also doing everything in the value chain. We're looking at farmer direct. That's an ability for us to get efficiencies between us and the producer, the way we buy grain. So of course, we get an advantage with that as the producer as well. And we're planning to increase our volumes 10%, leveraging on the 200,000 farmer relationships we have around the world. Of course, we have expanded capacity. We are expanding crush in Latin America. We are expanding crush in North America with Spiritwood. So I would say when you take that, plus our operational improvements, if you will, what we call the push for excellence, that was going to be the productivity and innovation agenda that were going to help us navigate through this. We see 2024 still as a strong year for Ag Services and Oilseeds, it's going to be lower, but it's still going to be a strong year. Of course, the market has priced a lot of the extra capacity and the higher argentine crop into the crush margins. But we still see the ability of the market to absorb all that capacity with a strong mill growth and with a strong demand for oils. So that on the Ag Services and Oilseeds side. On the Carb Solutions side, this business has been very stable over the last few years. It has had a very good 2022 and 2023. We are expecting a very good 2024, maybe slightly lower, but still very, very good. We had a good program for good contract renewals in 2024. We are happy with the margins. We have maintained margins for the most part, and we have gained some volumes, so volumes are strong. The milling business has been going, had a record year last year, and it continues to drive very strong. I think both businesses have a little bit of a lower contribution from feed products, where margins have decreased a little bit, but BioSolutions, as Ismael mentioned, continues to grow, is growing beyond 15% per year. And all their decarbonization things that we're saying, we see more and more demand for everything that carb solutions can bring to the table in that area. So we feel very good about that. Always the question mark in the year maybe is ethanol, but we're seeing right now, Adam, ethanol, the arbitrage to export from the U.S. is open to everywhere in the world. So it's just a matter of adjusting our capacity and the U.S. capacity to get more dehydrated ethanol, if you will, to be able to export, to adjust the humidity content, if you will. So, I think we'd export well north of maybe 1.5, 1.6 billion gallons for this year. That should bode well for recovery of margins as we go into the year. And then you take nutrition. Nutrition has been a growth story for many years, and we certainly stumbled in 2023. I mentioned some of the reasons. Some of the reasons were, there was a big destocking after all the COVID and all the supply chain issues that the industry have, the industry stopped. And now we went through lower inflation and this talking about that. So we had to go that in beverages, which drives flavors, which is our biggest engine for growth, if you will. Of course, we knew into the year that plant-based proteins, we have moderated our expectations for growth on that will still grow, but it's not going to be beyond 10%. So it's still going to be an attractive mid-single-digit growth, if you will. But we knew that, and then we had continued growth in continued good demand in pet and health and wellness and Animal Nutrition has been improving their P&L, doing a lot of self-help from the June P&L. It's been improving all the year. So unfortunately we get to the Q4 and we had several events in Q4. We have several one offs. We needed to take action on a couple of joint ventures and we addressed that. We needed to take a revaluation of an investment because of the end evaluation and we took that in the Q4. And then we have some issues on our own performance that we needed to implement 1ADM as much as we prepared for that. We had some problems with some of the modules. It was a successful implementation, but some of the modules that were about shipping products gave us trouble during the last quarter of the year. So when you have all that combination, it gave us a very bad quarter. We continue to see 2024 a year of growth or recovery, if you will, from the 2023 value. And from there, we should continue to march on our commitment to nutrition. Our ability to fulfill or to deliver a value proposition that resonates with customers continue to be evidenced by our growing pipeline, both in Animal and Human Nutrition, and our conversion rate we have benchmarked this is industry leading conversion rate. So we know we are winning. We need to adjust our own internal processes to make sure we deliver that. And we have done that heavily in the last -- second half of last year, and we have seen that during January and February that we are delivering much better than we did last year. So with that, I still look confident at the numbers, at the overall number for the company that we gave you for 2025. As I said on the onset, we are ahead on what we scheduled. From an EPS perspective, we are above 10% in ROIC and we have purchased already more than the $5 billion of share that we have estimated for 2025. So it's never going to be a straight line from here to 2025. But we have a resilient portfolio that can help us see that those numbers for the overall portfolio are still possible, as it was in December 2021. Sorry for the long answer. It's a large company. Yes, thank you, Tom. So, as we said before, Ismael mentioning his remarks, we expect crush margins between $35 to $60 for this year, they were about $70 per ton, maybe last year. I think it's fair to say that the market has completely priced or baked all the bad news into the crush margins are we having today? So, I would say board crush has moved significantly lower in the last month as the market probably gained more confidence in the availability of products, especially soybean meal, particularly when you think about Argentina now having sites on a crop that may be 50 million tons. And the U.S. crush industry also has performed very well. And the market continued to look forward to the second quarter of the year when they're going to have basically three offers for meal. That hasn't happened last year. So if you remember, last year, after Brazil finished in exporting, the U.S. became the only global, only gaming town, if you will. And that increased soybean meal values around the world, which makes soybean meal expensive, if you will for the Russian. We see that in the U.S., we saw, at least for ADM, we saw five consecutive months of record exports for soybean meal in the U.S. And the U.S. industry saw similar situation. So now with the correction in this, we expect that soybean meal will gain back into the Russians. Of course, feeding with meat pros and not soybean milk is not the optimal way to feed. So now that soybean milk has corrected, we expect that to happen. At the end of the day, Tom, the way I think about where crush is going to happen in the world is going to happen in both places where you have bean availability and where you have a domestic oil market. If you think of Brazil, Brazil is having B14 started in March. And that has helped with the margins of domestic oil for us in Brazil. And of course, you have a big crop, so you're going to have the bean availability and the domestic market. And then it will be the U.S. in which you have all the need of soybean oil to go into renewable green diesel and biodiesel and we have, of course, the bin availability. So we think that crush will favor those two places. Yes. Andrew, first of all, my comment before to Tom's question was the overall number that we gave for the company for 2025 in 2021. We still believe that number is there. I think that that number was never going to be a destination for ADM, was a milestone, if you will. And as we are reviewing our five-year plan that we do every year we see us breaking through that number. So in that sense, I expect 2024 to be a down year versus 2023 hopefully 2025 will be a positive year versus 2024. There is a cycle here that needs to happen, Andrew, that I described below, soybean mill will get cheaper. All the oil activities related to B-14 or RGD needs to grow. All that needs to happen and how long that adjustment takes, how long it takes for meal to be low enough to increase demand and for flat prices to be low enough to maybe make the farmer correct a little bit. They are planting all that process we know historically happens, when exactly it's going to happen. Does it happen in a calendar year? Doesn't happen in six months. Does it happen in a year is hard to say. But we continue to build a company that has more optionality, that's more resilience for the future. So as the cycle moderates, we continue to have more ability to bring more to the P&L. So we think with that, I'm optimistic about 2025 being better than 2024. Good morning, Ben. Yes, good question, Ben. Let me give you the puts and takes, if you will, on nutrition as we look at 2024. So as Ismael said in his remarks, about half of the headwinds that we faced last year were market. That means that half of them were in the other two buckets, the non-recurring events, if you will, and those by nature we hope that we're not going to have going forward. And I think Ismael qualified them about $60 million something give or take. And then the other ones were like some of the demand fulfillment issues that I explained how we have worked aggressively to correct. And we have seen good indication of that over the first two months of this year. So I would say those are the positive that we don't expect all that to happen again in 2024. You put on top of that a single digit revenue growth, mid-single digit revenue growth because of the pipeline that we have and the conversion of that pipeline. And that tends to happen every year. Then, as you described, we have to have to face a correction of texturizing prices that were exceptionally high last year. We're not going to have that. So that will be part of the negative side, if you will. And certainly, as we go through the year, we still need to bring Decatur East plant back into operations, and that will have a tail of a cost. So I would say the year will be driven by a strong recovery in Animal Nutrition, in flavors, and hopefully pet with some tailwinds in the specialty ingredients. That's how we see. Yes, Ben, I'm glad you're highlighting carb solution. They had a spectacular year. They deserve recognition and they've done a fantastic job of transforming their business into a very resilient and stable business. The assets let me take it by pieces. The milling business. Milling is an old business that has some old assets. And over the last few years, we have been doing -- the team has been doing a terrific job of shutting down some assets and consolidating those in new facilities like Mendota that we launched last year. That is the best and the newest wheat milling plant in the world. So we are happy with the way they have done that. They continue to do so. So that business is in good shape. When we look at the wet mills, we continue to invest in part of the wet mills. Unlikely that we're going to build a new wet mill, as you can understand, but that business continue to be reinvested in. It's a business that is a large business has a large asset footprint. And at the moment there is a lot of capital being associated with the path to decarbonize all these assets. So as you heard, we have a lot of efforts in trying to get pipelines to try to monetize some of our CO2 that come from the biogenic CO2 that come from the ethanol plants. So and I would say we have expanded Marshall because BioSolutions is growing at north of 15% per year. So we needed capacity. So the Marshall expansion is about 50% expansion to the final starch capacity that we have there. And that will help a lot with that. I would say the year is exciting as it is developing. It has solid margins. It has so far solid volumes. It had a little bit of a rough January because of the bad weather. We have ice in the plants and freezing weather. But February, March, things look good. And we think that that business has the opportunity to get some tailwinds from lower energy cost and maybe chemicals cost as the year go by. And that's a big energy hog, that business. So that could be an advantage and a tailwind coming later in the year. Yes. Thank you, Manav, for the question. Listen, I think the path is clear for RGD, that RGD will need vegetable oils. When you think about how Europe is doing, Europe not having a raw crop for that, Europe needs cooking oil, waste oils, and they will capture that. The U.S. will have to be fed with soybean oil, canola oil. And we see that commitment to be firm over the years. All these capacities being built, it cannot be filled with anything else. So we feel that is a strong trend ahead of us. Yes, Steven, listen, let me give you my thinking on that and the way we approach these things. So we always look, every time we do our five year plan, we take a look at those units that whether they are not returning, given our return expectations to date, we're not forecasting it to do it in the medium term. And those are the ones that we tend to take action. So we took action with a couple of joint ventures, as I mentioned, and then we look at every unit that is underperforming. What we do first is we try to bring them to performance. So we make sure that if there are some things that are self-inflicted, if you will, we correct those things. Once we correct those things, and then we have visibility to what could happen over the next two or three years, then we decide as a part of portfolio whether they belong in nutrition or they belong in another part of ADM, or they belong outside ADM. So that's a regular process. We done, we done it in the past with fertilizers, Latin America, we've done it in the past. We divested Bolivia. We divested cocoa and chocolate. So we've done this, and now we've done it with a couple of joint ventures. We've done it also. Ismael has done it in his previous job as an Animal Nutrition leader with some of the lines in Animal Nutrition that we cut, like 20 lines around the world. So sometimes we have exited countries. So it's a regular process that at times, maybe when you have a stumble like we had in nutrition, you look a little bit deeper, because now, all of a sudden, you have more businesses at lower performance. So we really want to see, is it worth investing in some of those? So we're in that process. So, nothing to announce today, but we continue to look at that very deeply. Yes. Thank you, Dushyant. Well, all useful biofuel production is, as I said, is expected to grow in Brazil. We're going to go to B14, so there are many countries that are increasing their mandates, whether it's Indonesia and all that. When you look at the overall balances around the world, you see plantations in Southeast Asia getting older, the trees getting older, so maybe less production of palm oil. So you're going to see biodiesel mandates increasing around the world and less competitive pressure, if you will, for palm oil. So you're going to see the pressure on vegetable oil. So we think that that will continue to be a strong leg of the crash, biodiesel in particular. Biodiesel margins are better right now for us in Europe. They have moderated significantly in the U.S., and we expect them to be good, but not as good as they used to be in the U.S. So that will be a little bit of a headwind for us in 2024. But margins are better in Brazil and in Europe. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Juan. Let's start on Slide 7 which provides overall segment operating income and EPS for 2023. Overall, we delivered the second highest earnings in company history, overcoming a challenging operating environment. Adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion for the full year, a 6% decrease versus the prior year. At a high level, operating profit was primarily down year-over-year in Ag Services & Oilseeds and Nutrition. In the other segment, which includes ADMIS and Captive Insurance, we had a significant increase in operating profit. Adjusted earnings per share were $6.98 for the year. Improved pricing in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition, as well as positive impacts from mark to market timing in AS&O more than offset the impact of lower crush margins, leading to a $0.70 per share improvement versus the prior year. Volume improvement in AS&O was more than offset by volume declines in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition, resulting in a $0.29 per share reduction in EPS versus the prior year. Higher manufacturing costs partially related to unplanned downtime at the Decatur complex led to a $0.41 per share decrease versus the prior year. And lower equity earnings primarily related to Wilmar attributed a $0.46 per share decrease versus the prior year. Increased corporate costs related to higher interest rates and the 1ADM implementation partially offset by higher ADMIS results drove a $0.30 per share versus the prior year. For other, benefits from share repurchases were more than offset by negative impacts related to a higher adjusted income tax rate and cycling one-time benefits from the Legal Recovery and Biofuel Producer Recovery program, leading to a $0.18 per share decrease versus the prior year. Moving to Slide 8, let's look at our segment performance for AS&O. For the full year, AS&O delivered $4.1 billion in segment operating profit, 8% lower than the record level in 2022. Ag Services segment operating profit was 15% lower versus the prior year as reduced origination volume and margins in North America were partially offset by record South American origination volumes. In global trade, destabilization of trade flows led to lower results compared to an exceptional 2022. Crushing segment operating profit for the full year was $346 million lower versus the prior year as improved process volumes were more than offset by lower crush margins and higher manufacturing costs. Refined Products and Other results were $469 million higher, resulting in a record year. Results were driven by higher volumes and margins in biodiesel. Market volatility drove positive timing impacts of approximately $235 million, compared to negative timing impacts of $90 million in the prior year. Equity earnings for Wilmar were $303 million in 2023, approximately 45% lower than the prior year. Now let's move to Slide 9 and look at Carbohydrate Solutions. For the full year Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit was $1.4 billion 3% lower versus the record prior year. In the Starches and Sweeteners segment higher pricing and mix were offset by weaker volumes and lower corn co-product values. The teams executed well in a dynamic environment, posting a record year in Wheat Milling. In Vantage Corn Processing strong exports and steady domestic demand and blending rates supported ethanol production and robust margins. The prior year also included onetime benefits of $50 million related to the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery program. We also continue to make significant progress on our BioSolutions strategic initiative, delivering revenue growth well ahead of our 15% plus target. Please now turn to Slide 10. In Nutrition, revenues of $7.2 billion for the full year were 6% lower versus the prior year. Demand headwinds and destocking impacts, coupled with operational challenges related to the ERP systems integration pressured volumes. This more than offset price and mixed benefits as well as positive currency impacts. In Human Nutrition volumes declined due to lower market demand for plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages, and operational challenges related to the ERP system implantation. This was partially offset by improved price and mix in flavors and texture and pricing in specialty ingredients. In Animal Nutrition, lower complete feed and premix volumes, the normalization of amino acid markets and demand fulfillment challenges in Pet Solutions led to lower revenue versus 2022. Now please turn to Slide 11. For the full year Nutrition segment operating profit was $427 million, 36% lower versus the prior year. Human Nutrition results of $417 million were 25% lower than the prior year as weaker volumes as well as increased costs related to operational challenges from the ERP implementation and unplanned Decatur downtime at Decatur East were partially offset by higher pricing. Animal nutrition results of $10 million were 91% lower compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower volumes and the normalization of amino acid pricing. When bridging from 2022, our performance can be characterized in three buckets, market forces, one-time items, and operational challenges. Market forces accounted for a majority of the deterioration in 2023 and as previously mentioned, this was mostly related to lower demand and plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages and lower premix and completely demand which impacted volumes across the industry. Yes, Salvator listen, a little bit of what I explained early on Adam's question. I think that we will see how the cycle plays in ASNO. As I said, I think that lower prices have this ability to incentivate demand. At this point in time If you think about soybean meal demand, we are forecasting a very strong soybean meal demand, maybe higher than USDA levels, higher than GDP. When you think about Southeast Asian economies recovering and with inflation moderating, purchasing power is improving, tourism is improving in all those areas, you have at the moment very high prices of beef that's favoring pork and chicken. You have protein margins for chicken being better at that. So we think that soybean meal will gain in the Russian. So when we look at all that, we see the soy oil demand very strong in domestic consumption, but also for biofuels, and then we see the meal demand very strong. We think that this correction should be probably short term for crash and that should come back again. I cannot make a prediction on the timing of that, but we know how the cycle plays. So whether it's calendar year this or six months later or a quarter earlier, it's not for me to venture into those guesses. I think that carb solutions between the exceptional job they are doing on managing their mature businesses and the growth that they are getting through decarbonization and BioSolutions, you will see that ahead of us. Again, we just bring in the Marshall expansion. That's not something that it was in our forecast last year. So we're going to have it more in the next three quarters, if you will, of the year, Spiritwood again, and some of the crash capacity we brought in Brazil, and then you see nutrition. That nutrition was not a contributor, certainly a big contributor to growth in 2023, but we expect it to be back to growth in 2024 and 2025. So those are kind of the buckets, if you will, that I see at the moment. Just a couple of complimentary comments, because not only have we had some experience historically, as Juan correctly mentions, with [indiscernible] and fertilizer, but certainly the Animal Nutrition was a good precursor to some of the thinking that we have now in mind for the whole of our nutrition business. In the sense that usually when you acquire these businesses, they come with footprint allocations, labs, farms, in our cases, and warehouses, that when you aggregate them, start aggregate them across a number of different acquisitions, you realize that there are overlaps. And what we noticed is that there was a significant opportunity in Animal Nutrition to significantly simplify the portfolio by reducing the number of labs, reducing the number of SKUs of plants. And we've seen those benefits. They've been occurring since the second half of 2023. And I think that some of that thinking, as we have built this organization via a multiplicity of acquisitions, lends itself now to a pause and reflection, in light of the successes that we've had with this, to apply it more broadly to all of the portfolio. So that's where our capital prudence is going to come in, by focusing on ensuring that we improve our asset base while returning cash to our shareholders."

            "content": "Let's turn to Slide 6, which I summarize our priorities for value creation in 2024. We continue building a stronger company for the future and to support this, we have identified three key priorities for 2024. One, managing the cycle; two, nutrition recovery; and three, enhanced return of cash to shareholders. Let's take a closer look at each of these areas of focus. We know that 2024 will be a more challenging year that we faced in 2022 and 2023. We see tailwinds that supported a portion of our performance over the past few years changing direction, making our continued progress on our strategic metrics more reliant than ever on our productivity and innovation agenda. In 2024, we will continue to focus on those strategic initiatives that provide strong growth prospects. Our destination marketing efforts continue to bring us closer to our customers and enable us to serve them in a differentiated capacity and we continue to expand. In 2023, we added three new offices across Asia and the Middle East, and in 2024 we plan to add two to four more. Through this ongoing expansion, we expect to achieve 6% growth in our destination market in volumes. Direct farmer buying has been steadily increasing over the past several years and provides ADM an opportunity to maximize value for both sides by creating efficiencies through working directly together. We plan to take this even further in 2024, leveraging our network of more than 200,000 farmer relationships to grow direct origination volumes year-over-year by about 10%. And as our customers strive to decarbonize their own products and services, we are seeing a steady increase in the financial returns generated by our own decarbonization efforts from Regen Ag partnerships to lowering the carbon footprint of our operations. The pace of this is accelerating as we move into 2024. Tied to these strategic initiatives, we continue to build capacity to serve growing customer demand. I mentioned earlier the opening of our Green Bison soy processing facility as well as the expansion of our Marshall, Minnesota starch facility. These capacity additions support growing demand for a wide variety of sustainable products and solutions, from renewable fuels to industrial products. And connected to our productivity efforts, we have formally launched a 2024 program we call the Drive for Execution Excellence within the organization. Over the years, we have consistently encouraged our ADM colleagues to identify and execute both cost saving and cash generation ideas. We've developed processes and systems through our prior transformation programs and now those are ramping up for another cycle. As part of this, we have already commissioned more than 300 projects and plan to see $500 million in traceable cost savings over the next two years across all aspects of our enterprise, from operations to supply chain to corporate costs. Now let's discuss our plans within the Nutrition business. We're calling this section, of course, nutrition recovery for a reason. Nutrition had a very difficult year with results well below our expectations, and we have been working aggressively to change this and return to growth. For Nutrition, 2023 representing a combination of challenging market forces, some specific non-recurring events and some misses on demand fulfillment. And while market forces such as customer destocking as well as softer demand for plant-based proteins are not within our control, we're already taking action on the areas we can improve. Many of the supply issues are the result of the complexity built into the Nutrition business over time. In our zeal to meet our customers' needs, we have created one of the strongest pantries in the industry. This added complexity in our operations and supply chain that at times impacted our ability to efficiently fulfill demand. To address this, we have made important changes to drive simplification across the Nutrition business that will ease the pressure on our overall supply chain and dramatically improve our demand fulfillment performance. First, we have created a stronger division of duty across operations leadership and added new leaders with a strong expertise in supply chain management. We have also taken steps to build our COE expertise back into the core business, helping make our overall supply chain capabilities more agile and responsive to commercial demand signals. We have also engaged third party experts to help identify further opportunities for operational excellence improvements across our largest facilities. We have also greatly simplified the product and production line landscape to further achieve operational and supply efficiency, reducing the brands we are presenting to customers by two thirds and downsizing about 17% of our SKUs alongside the strategic production line simplification. A recent example of this is the closure of more than 20 Animal Nutrition production lines in 2023, now better serving the product mix and supply chain efficiency of the business. We're also optimizing our Nutrition business portfolio, leveraging our experience in both large scale and bolt-on acquisitions. We have enhanced our approach to M&A integration to increase value creation as we focus more on the integration of recent acquisitions than new targets. We continue to assess our portfolio for a strategic fit, making surgical decisions to achieve the returns targets we expect. For example, during Q4, we took action on two JVs that were not expected to meet our returns criteria. We're proud to see how the team with new leadership has rallied around this recovery plan, which is already showing signs of improvement as we move through the first quarter of the year. Recent trends suggest that destocking impacts in beverages are subsiding and we are well positioned to capture recovering demand in 2024 as evidenced by the strong demand we are seeing in flavors. After heightening our operational efficiency, we've seen steady increases in shipping volumes and productions throughout the course of the last month. And in Animal Nutrition, we have seen another quarter of sequential improvement in the base of the business, which excludes amino acids and pet solutions and early indications in the first quarter of 2024 suggest that this will continue. Importantly, our nutrition value proposition continues to be well received by customers as evidenced by our robust opportunity pipeline and industry leading win rates across key categories like flavors, dietary supplements and pep. ADM's customer centricity and agile innovation capabilities, supported through our creation, design and development expertise, differentiates us. We continue to believe that Nutrition has an important role in ADM's integrated business model. Beyond adding value to the ingredients produced by our AS&O and carbohydrate solution businesses, Nutrition is innovating to address evolving consumer needs and is connecting us more closely with a growing customer base. Finally, I'll turn attention to the capital allocation strategy that continues to guide our strategic cash deployment decisions. As noted, we announced today that the Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion in shares through the remainder of the year, including $1 billion in shares to be executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical. This will total $6.4 billion in repurchases executed since 2022 and coupled with the already announced 11% dividend growth, this is aligned with our commitment to a balanced capital allocation approach. So, combined, we believe these three areas of focus set ADM to perform well in a challenging external operating environment in 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Ismael for more detail on the results of the operations. Ishmael?"

            "name": "SAVAN",
            "content": "Lastly, we also had our own operation struggles that impacted our ability to deliver on the strong demand that we have created. The implementation of ERP systems over the course of the year led to complications in shipping and producing products, negatively impacting both volumes and manufacturing costs. Over the past month, we have seen a steady improvement in operations and are confident that we will see volumes lost in 2023 come back in 2024. Now please turn to Slide 12. For the full year Other segment operating profit was $375 million, up 125% compared to the prior year. ADM Investor Services results improved on higher net interest income. Higher Captive Insurance results on new program premiums were partially offset by higher claim losses. In corporate for the full year, net interest expense increased year-over-year on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate cost increased versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support digital transformation efforts. Other corporate was unfavorable compared to the prior year due to one-time investment valuation losses of approximately $57 million. Please turn to Slide 13. Over the last two years the company has generated significant cash flow that have bolstered our balance sheet and provided us with financial flexibility to drive long-term growth. In 2023 we again had strong cash flow of $4.7 billion which were actualized in line with our balanced capital allocation framework. 30% or approximately $1.5 billion of cash flows were reinvested in the business to support growth and modernize our assets, including investments in new capacity and the digitization of our existing asset footprint. Our cash flows also supported significant capital return in 2023 with nearly 30% earnings going to dividends and nearly 60% of cash flows or about $2.7 billion going to shareholders via share repurchases. In 2024 we expect to hold capital expenditures to a level aligned with depreciation and amortization with focus spend around the safety and reliability of assets. We also intend to manage working capital needs prudently limiting M&A beyond previously announced transactions and focusing our team on cost savings and cash generation initiatives through the drive for Execution Excellence. As Juan mentioned earlier, our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will remain focused around the shareholder. We finished the year with strong momentum in terms of returning cash, repurchasing nearly 1.6 billion of shares in Q4 and nearly 330 million of shares so far in Q1. Over the course of the year, we intend to actualize 2 billion of additional share repurchases, with 1 billion being executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical. Now, let's transition to a discussion of guidance for 2024 on Slide 14 please. In 2024, global grain and oil seed supply is expected to increase as anticipated improvements in weather should support larger production levels in key South American countries. Assuming commodity prices ease for recent highs and trade flows adjust to the dislocations created over the past two years, we anticipate global soybean crush margins will moderate in 2024, likely moving into a range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton. From the demand side, we continue to expect vegetable oil demand growth from renewable diesel and low single digit soybean mill demand growth to support structural margin improvement. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.25 per share to $6.25 per share, representing an 18% decline from prior year at the midpoint. Now breaking down our expectations by segment for 2024, let's turn to Slide 15. In AS&O, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower and the full year to also be lower versus comparable prior periods as increased global commodity supply and normalization of margins will weigh on the segment. We anticipate global soy crush margins within the range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton as the market balances better soybean availability against increased crush and renewable diesel capacity. Our Operational Excellence efforts and the ramp up of our Green Bison facility should lead to mid-to-high single digit improvement in our process volumes. We expect significantly lower biodiesel margins in 2023, timing gains to reverse as contracts are executed. In Carbohydrate Solutions, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower versus the prior year. For the full year, we anticipate another strong year, but slightly lower than 2023 as the improved volumes and margins in Sweeteners and Starches could be offset by weaker ethanol. For nutrition, the first quarter is expected to be lower versus the prior year as we face headwinds from a normalizing texturants market, fixed costs associated with operational challenges related to the Decatur East and protein volumes. However, for the full year we expect Nutrition to begin its path to recovery. We anticipate conversion of our significant pipeline opportunities in Human and Animal Nutrition to yield mid-single-digit revenue growth. We assume market normalization in texturants to be a headwind in 2024. We do not anticipate the significant one-time events of 2023 to recur. Back to you, Juan."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\nMegan Britt: Thank you, Alex. Hello, and welcome to the third quarter earnings webcast for ADM. Starting tomorrow, a replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website. Please turn to Slide 2. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results.

On today's webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano will discuss our third quarter results and share some recent accomplishments on our strategic priorities. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar will review segment level performance and provide an update on our cash generation and capital allocation actions. Juan will have some closing remarks, and then, he and Vikram will take your questions. Please turn to Slide 3. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Megan and good morning to all who have joined for today's call. Today, ADM reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, this equates to an adjusted earnings per share of $5.62, that will represent ADM's second best EPS year achieved in just the first nine months and an adjusted operating profit of $4.8 billion. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13.2%. This result reflect yet another strong quarter for ADM. I'm proud of the team's nimble execution against our strategic plan while adjusting our business model in light of both global macro trends and the evolving needs of our customers. The global market is increasingly dynamic with factors that create both opportunities and challenges for ADM to address. Consumer behavior has shown growing variability, spending more in some categories, while slow in spending in others. And our team has a proven ability to manage through these and the impacts of geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and the constantly adjusting balances of commodity supply and demand. Within each business, we are focused on navigating these external factors carefully, while we're also building on the momentum we've seen through the year-to-date. As we look ahead, we are on track to exceed our 2023 previous expectations for the total company. In Ag Services & Oilseeds, we saw the accelerated energy transition support strong demand for vegetable oil, leading to a solid crush environment. We leveraged our flexible logistics footprint to manage Brazil's record crop and our Global Trade franchise to best match supply to demand worldwide. In Carb (ph) Solutions, we delivered a record third quarter on the strength of solid margins in starches, sweeteners, and flower, as well as robust ethanol demand that help us drive strong volumes and margins. In Nutrition, Flavors growth continued to outpace the market, while we both grew and executed on our revenue opportunity pipeline. The deliberate productivity and cost management actions we have taken in Animal Nutrition are enabling improved performance as we also see market volume recovery and we continue to navigate pockets of soft demand in certain categories of the Nutrition portfolio. Next slide, please. One of ADM's greatest competitive advantages is the breadth and integration of our business model, reaching from farm to fork. 2023 has offered several examples that of how we are creating new areas of growth in each business units. On the farm, ADM has one of the largest and most sophisticated global origination networks, connecting with hundreds of thousand farmer partners worldwide. We have unique and deep relationships with the people and technologies that are shaping the future of agriculture. So as more of our customers are looking for traceable, sustainable crop sources in their own supply chains, we are a natural connector and influencer. We are proud to have announced partnership with PepsiCo, Nestle and Carlsberg, and have a target of 4 million regenerative acres and goal by 2025. The carbon equivalent of power in more than 100,000 homes a year. Moving into production, as the pace of energy transition accelerates, demand for renewables fuel sources is growing rapidly and ADM is in a leading position to capitalize on this trend. With our Spiritwood JV with Marathon currently being commissioned, we are ready to fit the production of a targeted 75 million gallons of renewable green diesel per year. We have announced the Broadwing Energy Project, delivering lower emission power source and a critical part of lowering our carbon emissions used to power Decatur operations. And we're innovating to deliver a new low-carbon intensity products within the fast growing BioSolutions portfolio. And as we connect to the consumer, we're working closely with our customers to serve the challenges of their consumers, whether it's sustainable solutions, the latest flavor or a cost effective ingredient replacement or explore in the future of nutrition through work with ADM Ventures partners like Air Protein and Nourished. And we have differentiated our offerings with the next-generation of evidence-based health and wellness solution. With the world's largest probiotic manufacturing facility in Valencia, more than 50 clinical trials underway and a growing team of deep scientific experts, we are well positioned for the expanding demand for functional foods and personalized nutrition. And to efficiently execute on all areas of growth while maintaining an efficient cost structure, we continue to vigilantly focus on productivity, as well as the culture that let our ADM colleagues bring their best every day. Across our global organization, we're standardizing processes and systems through One ADM and modernizing our operations through digital transformation, driving greater efficiencies while enabling the best use of our workforce and production capacity. Our planned modernization program continues to deliver impressive operational benefits, including advanced analytics and safety improvements across the 17 operations facilities currently in implementation phase. With more than 70 plants in the scope, the planned recurring cost savings associated with automation across our footprint in 2024 is already nearing $20 million per year. Our cultural efforts are the critical foundation for all of these strategic initiatives. We have ramped up our focus on a culture of caring, specifically in regards to the safety of our colleagues. This is our top priority. And our recent performance in this area has not lived up to our expectations. We are committed to taking action to improve and have already begun to do so with the assistance of both internal and external experts. We will do better. By actively managing productivity, innovation and culture and aligning work to the interconnected trends in food security, health and wellbeing and sustainability, ADM is well positioned for sustainable long-term profit growth across new and adjacent avenues. And with the strong performance in 2023 and a constructive expectation for the remainder of the year, we are again raising our full-year earnings outlook. For a deeper look at our Q3 performance, let me hand over to Vikram, who will cover results of operations.\nVikram Luthar: Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 5. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team once again delivered solid results in an increasingly dynamic environment by leveraging our experience, scale and integrated global footprint. Ag Services results were lower than the strong third quarter of 2022. South American origination results were higher year-over-year as our team delivered significantly higher volumes and margins on strong export demand. Prior investments in port capabilities have enabled us to structurally grow our earnings while capitalizing on a stronger margin environment across the region. North American results were lower year-over-year as a result of the shift of export demand to Brazil, due to the large crop there as well as low water levels in the U.S. river system, limiting volume and barge capacity. Effective risk management, combined with higher volumes and margins in Global trade led to strong results. However, much lower than the record quarter last year. The current quarter also included a $48 million insurance settlement related to damages from Hurricane Ida. In Crushing, we delivered another strong quarter, but lower than the prior year as global crush margins remained healthy, but lower than the very strong levels of a year ago. Our strong results were led by North America, as the crush margin environment remains well supported by structurally higher demand for vegetable oils. We officially opened our new crush facility in Spiritwood, North Dakota to meet growing demand. We are currently in the commissioning process and expected to be running at full rates in early November, adding an additional 1.5 million metric tons of crush capacity per year. In EMEA, we continue to optimize our flex capacity to prioritize crush of higher margin softseed, in line with market opportunities. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects which were lower than the net positive impacts in the prior year quarter. Refined Products and other posted another strong quarter, higher than the prior year period, results were led by solid volumes and margins in North America. In EMEA, robust export demand for biodiesel and domestic demand for food oil drove higher results versus the prior year. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects, which are expected to reverse as contracts execute in future periods. Equity earnings from Wilmar was significantly lower versus the third quarter of 2022. Looking ahead, for the fourth quarter in Ag Services and Oilseeds, we anticipate strong results that are slightly lower than last year, excluding the $110 million legal settlement in the ag services subsegment from the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect Ag Services results to be in line with the prior year, excluding the legal settlement. We anticipate similar year-over-year North American export volumes, a competitive South American export program and continued strong performance from global trade. We forecast our crushing subsegment will deliver strong results similar to the prior year. We expect robust soy and canola crush margins and with the ramping of our Spiritwood operations higher volumes. We expect RPO to perform well, but be significantly below last year as positive timing impacts from prior quarters are expected to reverse. Slide 6, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered an outstanding quarter that was significantly higher than the prior year, enabled by the ongoing optimization of our production and supply chain network. The starches and sweeteners subsegment were higher year-over-year on a healthy demand and strong margin environment across starches, sweeteners, wheat flour and ethanol. Our team generated new customer wins and delivered double-digit growth year-to-date in our BioSolutions platform. As Juan touched on earlier, we also signed a formal agreement with Broadwing Energy to provide lower emissions power to Decatur facility, extending our ability to provide low carbon solutions across the value chain. In the Vantage Corn Processors subsegment, our team executed well in a strong ethanol demand and margin environment, leading to significantly higher year-over-year results. Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect steady demand and margins for our starches, sweeteners and wheat flower products. We remain constructive on ethanol margins driven by solid domestic demand and healthy U.S. exports, supported by lower competing exports from Brazil due to higher sugar prices. We anticipate results to be similar to the prior year period, but with upside potential if the current ethanol margin structure holds. On Slide 7. In Nutrition, strong results in Flavors, health and wellness and recovery in the base Animal Nutrition business were more than offset by continued lower demand for plant-based proteins and persistent demand fulfillment challenges in pet solutions. Flavors reported impressive results in a complex operating environment, delivering a 29% growth in operating profit on a constant currency basis. Results were led by pricing actions in EMEA and strong win rates in North America. During the quarter, we also implemented a successful go-live of our One ADM project in the EMEA region across 18 locations in 12 countries. This represents a significant milestone as we continue to harness digital across the enterprise to drive productivity gains. In Specialty Ingredients, weak market demand, particularly in the alternate meat category, inventory adjustments and unplanned downtime resulting from the recent Decatur incident led to significantly lower year-over-year results. The plant-based protein market has been experiencing destocking and consumer demand softness over the course of the year that will likely persist into next year. Given these recent market dynamics, we have re-scoped our Decatur protein modernization investment project to better match the expected lower growth demand environment. Also, we are leveraging our expertise in creation, design and development to differentiate our product offerings to serve evolving consumer needs. These adjustments will enable a faster pivot to higher growth and more resilient categories such as specialized nutrition, which have synergies across the nutrition portfolio, and we are rapidly building this revenue pipeline. Health & Wellness results were higher year-over-year due to double-digit bioactives sales and a favorable impact related to the revised commercial agreement with Spiber. During the quarter, we realized a significant expansion in our revenue pipeline, reinforcing the demand for evidence-based solutions. In Animal Nutrition, we are beginning to see the cost optimization actions and the expansion of offerings in the specialty feed and ingredient space from earlier this year, driving improved performance. However, the recovery in the base business was more than offset by normalized year-over-year amino acids margins as well as lower profit contribution from the Pet Solutions business. Looking forward, we anticipate flavors to finish the year strong, driven by growth in EMEA and North America. Health & wellness operating profit is expected to finish similar to last year. Animal Nutrition operating profit is expected to continue to recover sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Specialty Ingredients operating profit is expected to be down significantly, impacted by the recent Decatur East incident and demand softness. All in, we now expect full year 2023 operating profit for Nutrition to be around $600 million. While our results in 2023 have been below our expectations, we expect nutrition to return to growth in 2024. We will continue to build on the Flavors momentum from 2023. Health & wellness should maintain its steady performance. The cost actions in the shopper pivot to higher-margin products will enable Animal Nutrition to drive growth, further reinforced by improved go-to-market capabilities. Lastly, for SI, we will work aggressively to restart operational capabilities at Decatur East to minimize the impact in 2024. Slide 8, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher net interest income. Captive insurance results were slightly lower on higher claim settlements partially offset by premiums from new programs. In corporate results, net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year, primarily on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs of $298 million were higher versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support our digital transformation efforts. Other corporate was favorable versus the prior year, primarily due to foreign currency hedges. We still forecast corporate cost to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was approximately 20% higher than the prior year primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. Through the third quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $3.8 billion. We continue to invest in the business, allocating $1.1 billion to capital expenditures and have returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We have ample liquidity with over $13 billion of cash and available credit, and our balance sheet is very strong, with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9. Our fortress balance sheet gives us the financial flexibility to drive our long-term strategic agenda while also returning capital to shareholders and is also a competitive advantage, particularly in a higher for longer interest rate environment. We have completed $1.1 billion of share repurchases through Q3 and expect to increase the pace of repurchases in Q4. Even with the softness in nutrition, and lower-than-expected profit contributions from Wilmar. We are raising our 2023 earnings outlook again and now anticipate full year EPS in excess of $7 per share. Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vikram. As we close today's call, let me share a few thoughts about how we're seeing our efforts in 2023 position ADM to continue solid progression into 2024. External factors that influence ADM's forward look are closely aligned to the enduring macro trends we have positioned ourselves to be nimble in managing. We continue to see the interconnectivity across food security, health and well-being and sustainability having an amplifying effect across the industries we serve. More frequent extreme weather, extreme weather, geopolitical events and the recent pandemic have all highlighted the criticality of food security within those geographies and for the regions that are served by their agricultural exports. Connected to this, we see areas of supply abundance growing as evidenced by Brazil's record recent crop cycles and areas of need shifting. In some cases, this has resulted in either more domestic consumption in countries like the U.S. or elevated import demand situations where our unparalleled global asset base and deep experience are critical. Government policies beginning to support new demand patterns, whether based on a move to more renewable energy sources or an effort to increase regenerative agriculture supply. Science continues to accelerate innovation in Nutrition with an ever-present consumer interest in turning their food, beverage and supplement consumption to their personal health and dietary needs. Beyond the challenges and opportunities connected to these external factors, we believe ADM is positioned to leverage productivity and innovation to build momentum in the coming year, a continuation of the strategic efforts we have been driving throughout 2023. We anticipate our Services and Oilseeds continue to leverage its extended value chain and deliver structural changes to demand. We anticipate that crush margins will remain healthy while our productivity measures enable us to have a more efficient cost structure. We continue to drive opportunistic extension of our destination marketing scope, grow our regenerative agriculture acres and partnerships, and expand our renewable fuels feedstock production. In Carb Solutions, the compounding effects of our transformative investments coupled with early contracting for starches and sweeteners and what we believe to be a positive ethanol environment are setting up for another strong year in 2024. For Nutrition, we expect continued growth in our revenue opportunity pipeline with significant conversions continuing as we move past some near-term demand weakness. Our expanding results in flavors continue to signal acceleration across our broader portfolio. We expect the positive revenue growth trends in Health & Wellness to drive into next year, and we're already pivoting Specialty Ingredients towards high potential areas like alternative daily and specialized nutrition. Our actions in Animal Nutrition are delivering a positive impact and sustained opportunity growth, which we believe will expand further through the segment in the coming year. And by applying our commercial excellence efforts to this portfolio, we are focusing on the value of innovation in the specialty parts of the business. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness. With the momentum we have been building upon the foundation for growth we have established, I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pave a path for long-term profit growth. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital Markets. Andrew, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Strelzik: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask about the U.S. crush margin outlook. You commented that you expect crush margins to remain healthy. And I guess this is really a question about 2024 where the U.S. broadcast features have come down. What's your perspective on what's going on there? Do you think that the crush capacity that's coming on is having an impact, or how is that being absorbed? I guess, just trying to frame your commentary around momentum with what's going on in crush? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. Listen, our perspective have not changed. If anything, the perspective that we have for the market has been confirmed by what we're saying. Of course, it's a very dynamic environment with the market trying to balance a lot of issues, whether it's more availability of products, more demand, the Argentine situation. We have seen board crush explode back to near the highs recently. And this is just only a reflection of the incredible demand that is coming for soybean meal into the U.S. This drives the board crush has -- it was mill driven maybe before it was oil driven, this was mill driven. You see Argentina situation, they are getting to the end of their inventory. There are probably enough beans at this point for crushers to run until November. So what we see the export book of the U.S. for soybean meal is a record export book from the U.S., something that is higher than over the last 10 years. So I think that, that will continue well into Q1 of 2024. And fundamentally, what has changed, and you have that, if you were island of strong crush margins in the U.S. is this demand for oil. We see crush margins have been a little bit lower for soybean, certainly in Brazil or in Europe, and it\u2019s because some of the oil prices have declined. But in the U.S. with the new demand for renewable green diesel and the new \u2013 all the new capacity coming, we expect that to remain strong for years to come. So we will continue to be very constructive at our crush margins in the U.S.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Ben, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Yeah. Good morning. Juan, Vikram, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow up on Nutrition and the updated guidance calling that roughly $600 million op income for the year. Help us understand if you can, putting that into context to what just a while ago, we've talked about the path to make this business a $1 billion operating income business. What has gone into the wrong direction and what do you still need to correct to bring this business back on track to make it a $1 billion contributor? Thank you.\nVikram Luthar: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ben. So let's take it by different business lines. So in flavors, as I mentioned, Q3 had a very strong performance. And if you actually look year-to-date, Flavors operating profit is up 16%. And I think that's been a very important growth engine, and typically, the sales cycle in Flavors tends to be shorter than some of our other product portfolios. So just keep that in mind, that momentum is building and we see that momentum through our revenue pipeline, which is increasing month-over-month, we anticipate momentum in Q4 and frankly, continuing into 2024. The other aspect is EBITDA margins of Flavors is also increasing. It's not just revenue growth. The profit is also as a consequence of EBITDA margin expansion. And finally, Flavors contribution year-to-date overall as a part of nutrition profitability is a little over 50%. So important to keep that as a back of your mind as we think about the future. The second part of the Human Nutrition business, Health & Wellness. Health & Wellness have been steady. Actually, the dietary supplements market, which was a little bit of a headwind has -- we see the destocking tend to see the bit, and we are optimistic about the outlook next year. The other thing that Juan mentioned is the evidence-based portfolio of ingredients is expanding and our ability to apply that into functional food and solutions gives us confidence and that business to continue growing into next year and beyond. Specialty Ingredients. Actually, it's a tale of two cities within Specialty Ingredients. There's a texturants (ph) portfolio that has done exceptionally well because of expansion of margins. We don't talk much about that, but because it's a smaller part of the business, but that has performed exceptionally well this year. The challenge has been on the plant-based protein market. And the plant-based protein is driven by market softness, right? There is a softness in the market, and we've gone down as a consequence of what's happening in the market. What we are doing from that perspective is pivoting the portfolio into some of the more resilient categories like specialized nutrition like or to dairy. It doesn't happen overnight. But remember, we -- through our CD&E capabilities, it allows us to pivot our product portfolio into the categories that are growing, and we will do that. We are in the process of doing that. What happened in the interim is the Decatur East incident. What that's created is a challenge in terms of white flake production for specialty proteins in North America. So that's been a drag that we clearly had not foreseen and that drag is going to continue into 2024. So within Human Nutrition, Flavors performing exceptionally well outpacing the market, Health & Wellness study, SI is kind of in line with market, further exacerbated by the recent Decatur East incident. Then step into Animal Nutrition, what happens with amino acids. We were coming off very high margins in 2022. The good news is, we are going to reset in a much more normalized margin levels in 2023. So therefore, '24 onwards, we won't have that lapping impact of higher amino acid margins. But if you exclude amino acid margins, the base Animal Nutrition business, excluding pet solutions, we talked about all the actions of business is undertaking to optimize costs as well as drive focus on Specialty Ingredients, that is being recognized in performance. We are seeing the benefits of that and you'll see sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. So that, we feel very good about this in Q4 as well as going forward. Ag Solutions, demand creation remains solid, that category has been fantastic. We've had challenges in demand fulfillment in North America, and particularly, we talked about that primarily in the recent acquisition that we did in 2021. Those are still lingering, but we have very clear action plans, and we feel confident that by the end of this year and early next year, we will be able to more than offset that. So all in all, combined with that a new innovation, we feel pretty confident that nutrition will return to growth in 2024. And albeit maybe at a slightly lower growth rate than we had anticipated before. But getting to $1 billion is definitely within the horizon. It may not happen in the next year or in year falling, but definitely in the near term or in the medium term.\nBen Theurer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Tom, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTom Palmer: Good morning and thanks for the question. The details on the crush moves, I think Andrew's question was helpful. But maybe we could dig a little bit more into what's happening on the oil side. I mean we have seen soybean oil prices come down over the past couple of months. The futures curve does suggest some continued pressure as we move into '24. It sounds like you have plenty of visibility that demand is very strong on this side, but maybe just some color on what might have caused this downward price move and whether it's more temporary in nature in your view?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Tom. Listen, North America refining margins are lower in this quarter. I think if you look at last year, the high priced oils were impacted by supply chain disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war. So I would say this is a more normalized environment. We have also some positive timing impacts due to the pronounced RIN and HVO market movements, pulling forward some of those gains. I would say when we look at the forward quarter, we see remain refining margins to remain strong, but maybe a decline from the elevated highs we saw in 2022 on the early part of this year. Biodiesel margins are also coming out of the highs, as maybe the RIN value component of margin has declined as the industry is building a bank of rings. So we still have not seen a significant pull from the RD demand that it's been building but we maintain our expectation of how much it's going to be built there. So we think that is coming. The other thing you need to think about oil is that demand for food oil is very strong and has rebounded. And there are expectations now that with El Nino, we might have and with the natural maturity of the plantations in the -- in Southeast Asia that we might have a little bit less supply of palm oil and all that. So although, we are coming off the highs, we continue to be constructive about margin stabilizing at a strong level in the RPO area.\nTom Palmer: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to -- maybe dig in on the Carb Solutions outlook and maybe if you could just parse the non-ethanol pieces a little bit more. And I think in the prepared remarks, you alluded to kind of a favorable start to contracting in North America sweeteners and starches and maybe elaborate on what you are actually seeing there, maybe better frame kind of the incremental capital investments to come in that business. Obviously, there's a lot of transformation work happening in that business. That's not all much kind of come to fruition in the near term, but better contextualize kind of what the actual level of investment that you've already committed to there, there is? And if I could just ask a clarifying question on the last point on RPO. How much was the timing benefit in the third quarter?\nVikram Luthar: About $95 million.\nAdam Samuelson: Thank you.\nVikram Luthar: So on the Carb Solutions question, Adam, I think it's important to just frame it. The liquid sweetener volumes have been steady. And this has happened throughout this year. Almost every quarter, we've said that. So the demand has been pretty resilient, and the margin structure has been strong. The other thing that's actually helpful is strong exports to Mexico as well as higher sugar prices. The specialty volumes in North America have been a bit soft, but with the improved mix and pricing, our margins have actually expanded. The BioSolutions market, we're actually extending into new applications, and that revenue growth year-to-date is 23%. Wheat flour demand has been resilient. The optimization I referred to in my comments, has actually helped improve the cost structure and expand margins. As on all you know what's going on in ethanol. It as goes, the margin structure there is very supportive given domestic demand, blend economics, strong U.S. exports, as well as the fact that we've got a significant -- actually higher domestic driving miles. Now when you think about next year, I mean we're well set up for the Q4 '23, and I already talked about that. It's a little early to say, but based on the strong finish that we anticipated in 2023, and early '24 contracting in North America, sweeter and starches, we are optimistic for solid volumes and our ability to actually maintain and potentially even expand margins in our core starches and sweeteners portfolio. We'll tell you more in our February call, but going in, the outlook is constructive and similarly for ethanol, that tends to be volatile. But right now, the general trends to be supportive of a higher-for-longer ethanol margin environment.\nAdam Samuelson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Ben, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBen Bienvenu: Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. I have kind of a two-pronged question. One is -- one, you've kind of hit bits and pieces and Vikram as well with the nutrition commentary of the overall business outlook into 2024. The kind of implicit takeaway is, we should still expect kind of very strong and above what, I guess, we would think of as mid-cycle earnings power in 2024, albeit it's early to make that call in 2024. So correct me if I'm wrong there. But two, when you think about allocating capital at this point in the cycle, how does that change, if at all, with what you've been doing over the last several years, and you've been picking up your buyback activity, how should we be thinking about that as we move through this period of time as well? Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Ben. Good question. Listen, we see 2024 with a lot of optimism. We're working through the plan right now, as you can imagine at this time of the year. We continue to see the strength of Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carb Solutions continuing. Ag Services and Oilseeds, we have seen some fundamental structural changes. And I think that that's a multiyear trend. So we're going to see higher crush margins, at least in the United States for quite a while. And our Ag Services business continued to grow around the world in the -- with the strength of destination marketing and that exacerbated concern about food security that bring -- brought by all the geopolitics and the weather events and the pandemic and all that continues and continue to enhance margins for us to the service we provide around the world. So we see that business being very solid and very strong contributor. Carb Solutions, I think that Vikram touched a little bit on the dynamics of the contracting for next year. But beyond that, I think that you have to remember that we are having different uses. We are finding new demand for those products that will do two things, will grow as revenue into new categories like, we're seeing in BioSolutions that is growing double-digits. But it's also going to tighten up the supply for the existing products. So that will be constructive to margins over time, and we've seen that already, so those are the two. And I think Nutrition and Vikram went into a lot of detail into that and all the different pieces. And we're very confident we're going to go back to growth next year. This year, maybe you call it the past that refreshes, we took a pause this year. But the fundamental innovation engine that we have, that's our differentiation. That continues to resonate strongly, whether it's in Health & Wellness in what we are seeing in Flavors or the specialty pieces of Animal Nutrition or the demand generation impact, where the markets are normal and we apply that properly, we are winning more than our fair share, and we're growing faster than the competitors. So we see that with a lot of optimism for next year. When we think about how that correlates to our thinking of how to deploy capital, the priority to deploying capital is in our investment plan, and we have been doing that both in OpEx and in CapEx. Unfortunately, CapEx continues to be higher, inflationary pressure there, whether it's non-power or supply of raw materials, make us take a second look at a lot of the capital. And I think that Vikram has reflected on some of the adjustments that we made, maybe to Specialty Ingredients and other. So we're taking a look at that, and we're reviewing as always in our capital discipline on every project. But we have many opportunities in front of us, and we're going to continue to fund them. We have increased our return to shareholders. Certainly, our cash flow generation is very strong. And to be honest, when we see some of the pivot we are doing even in Carb solution with some of these opportunities, they are not hugely loading our CapEx, if you will. Some of these things where there is the pipeline for decarbonization is with partners, whether it's the LG Chem or other joint ventures are also partnerships. So it's not that taxing in our CapEx budget, if you will. So we think that we're going to continue to increase the return to shareholders. And we've been opportunistic looking at, of course, the M&A environment. And to be candid, we participate in many. We have many items on the fire, but the reality is that valuations have not come down, and we plan to continue to keep our discipline in that regard. So we continue to be opportunistic in that and we look at that. I think Vikram will make a comment on this one.\nVikram Luthar: Yeah. I think also in terms of buybacks, good to remind everyone that if you remember in our 2021 Investor Day, we talked about $5 billion of buybacks over the next four years through 2025. If you combine what we've done last year and this year, we've done almost about $2.6 billion of buyback, so we are ahead of that pace. And as I mentioned in my comments and as Juan said, if we don't see compelling valuations and given our discipline, we probably at these trading levels, price levels, we probably are going to buy back a little more aggressively, and you probably will see a stronger pace of buybacks in Q4 as a consequence of some of those factors.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Very good. Thanks so much.\nVikram Luthar: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSalvator Tiano: Thank you very much. I want to ask a little bit about the carbonization and the work you're trying to do Decatur. And I think when we -- you were talking about the 7 million tons of you're trying to sequester per year, the idea is that some of these will come from other facilities where you probably need to build pipelines. I'm just wondering, we're seeing a lot of issues with permitting and other issues with CO2 pipelines in other regions. Could this -- could you face similar issues and could this affect the total amount you will be able to request your indicator or on the other hand, could this actually be an opportunity and people that were relying on some other pipelines like Navigator 1 (ph) may come to you and use your indicator wells for sequestration?\nJuan Luciano: Yeah. Thank you, Salvator for the question. This is a very important initiative for ADM. And it's something that, as you know, we have started like 10 years ago, so it's something that we have a lot of experience in, and we're leveraging that experience and that head start, if you will, in our ability to inject carbon into the lower surfaces in our facility at Decatur. We have a couple of wells there, and we're planning, as you said, to create five more injection wells over the next few years. It is true part of that will be bringing biogenic CO2 generated by our ethanol plants through pipelines. And we are working already in two of those pipelines. We have already submitted permits for all that. Those permits have been accepted. So they are complete. They are in the process of being studied and analyzed, and we are reviewing also with our partners the right of way and acquisitions and all those type of agreements. Of course, as any industry that is breaking ground the pioneer suffer sometimes with the regulatory environment and having to adjust all that. So we're working closely with the authorities across different states and in terms of trying to align the regulatory framework to the needs of decarbonization and to the desires of the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture to have a smart agriculture in the U.S. and decarbonize that. So work in progress, as you said, we have seen the news that you do. And you can take two tax that we might suffer a similar fate or that we will have less competition as you described. At this point in time, we don\u2019t have any bad news to report other than we continue forward with our efforts, and we will update you in the next call.\nSalvator Tiano: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Davis Sunderland of Baird. Davis, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDavis Sunderland: Hey. Good morning, team. Thank you for the time and thank you for taking my question.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome.\nDavis Sunderland: Juan you already talked about it a little bit, but I just wanted to ask if you could expand a little bit more on the ethanol and renewable diesel supply and demand environment, maybe what you're seeing for '24 and beyond? And if you anticipate any incremental changes in consumer behavior over that time? Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano: Yeah, Davis. Listen, in ethanol, we think ethanol is going to have a very constructive environment, very high sugar prices are driving Brazilians to produce a lot of sugar versus ethanol, so we're going to have less inputs of ethanol, biofuels mandates are growing around the world, whether it's more ethanol or more biodiesel. So we see Brazil going up 1% per year in that regard. And we see ethanol continues to have very good export. It has a very good value to other [indiscernible] that normally, they go for like $2.50 per gallon. So we have a big advantage around the world. And for people that want to increase the octane in their gasoline. Ethanol is a very cheap [indiscernible] around the world. So the U.S. is the best producer of that, will continue to increase. So you can see export having maybe a floor of 1.4 billion gallons going into 1.5 million. So that's very good. When we look at renewable green diesel, there has been no changes on how we see renewal diesel growth in the medium term, which is to get to around 5 billion gallons in the U.S. by 2025, 2026. Of course, we're a global company, we see that becoming 7 billion to 8 billion gallons by maybe -- and maybe 14 billion, 15 billion gallons of renewable green diesel and SAF online by 2026 and 2027. So we are at the very early innings of all these biofuel demand that is coming, whether it\u2019s again for renewable green diesel or the promise of decarbonization that SAF brings to aviation that it doesn\u2019t have any other valid options right now. So again, we\u2019re going to be a player that speedy good shows that. We\u2019re going to bring 1.5 million tons of capacity that will feed 75 million gallons of RGV. So we expect the others will deliver as we have delivered Spiritwood. So this is an industry we\u2019re building that we\u2019re excited about.\nDavis Sunderland: Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley. Steven, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSteven Haynes: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just ask a question on the guidance. I think previously, you're kind of saying $7 with some upside and now you're saying in excess of $7. So maybe if you could just kind of help us, I don't know, maybe quantify the difference in the two guidances and size, the upside piece would be helpful. Thank you.\nVikram Luthar: Well, so I think the first thing to note is, when in Q2, we said around $7 for potential -- with potential for more upside. And what we have seen saying right now is that potential upside is coming through, and that's why we're raising our guidance in excess of $7. But if you step back, Steven, think about what's happened between Q2 and Q3. One is, clearly, nutrition has been softer. We had guided to it similar in Q2. Now we are guiding to around $600 million. So you know, by definition, there's a compensation in other parts of the business. And when you think about the compensation relative to our Q2, that's probably going to come partially from AS&O and partially from CS. And we gave some guidance on AS&O for Q4 and also some guidance for CS. CS to be rough relatively flat versus Q4, barring any continued expansion in ethanol margins, so that could be upside in CS. And in AS&O, we have some puts and takes in RPO in particular, and one went through this. We expect that to be weaker than Q4 of last year just because we expect these mark-to-market timing gains we realized in Q3 to be rolling off. And then in Ag Services, it\u2019s going to be generally flat, excluding the legal settlement that was a onetime thing in Q4 of last year. And then in crush, it\u2019s going to be strong. And I think Juan talked about that we are continuing to be constructive about the cross outlook particularly in the U.S. going forward, given some of the structural demand changes related to renewable green diesel in particular.\nSteven Haynes: Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we currently have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Ms. Britt for any further remarks.\nMegan Britt: Thank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up with me if you have any other questions. Have a good day, and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call.

            "content": "Thank you, Megan and good morning to all who have joined for today's call. Today, ADM reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, this equates to an adjusted earnings per share of $5.62, that will represent ADM's second best EPS year achieved in just the first nine months and an adjusted operating profit of $4.8 billion. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13.2%. This result reflect yet another strong quarter for ADM. I'm proud of the team's nimble execution against our strategic plan while adjusting our business model in light of both global macro trends and the evolving needs of our customers. The global market is increasingly dynamic with factors that create both opportunities and challenges for ADM to address. Consumer behavior has shown growing variability, spending more in some categories, while slow in spending in others. And our team has a proven ability to manage through these and the impacts of geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and the constantly adjusting balances of commodity supply and demand. Within each business, we are focused on navigating these external factors carefully, while we're also building on the momentum we've seen through the year-to-date. As we look ahead, we are on track to exceed our 2023 previous expectations for the total company. In Ag Services & Oilseeds, we saw the accelerated energy transition support strong demand for vegetable oil, leading to a solid crush environment. We leveraged our flexible logistics footprint to manage Brazil's record crop and our Global Trade franchise to best match supply to demand worldwide. In Carb (ph) Solutions, we delivered a record third quarter on the strength of solid margins in starches, sweeteners, and flower, as well as robust ethanol demand that help us drive strong volumes and margins. In Nutrition, Flavors growth continued to outpace the market, while we both grew and executed on our revenue opportunity pipeline. The deliberate productivity and cost management actions we have taken in Animal Nutrition are enabling improved performance as we also see market volume recovery and we continue to navigate pockets of soft demand in certain categories of the Nutrition portfolio. Next slide, please. One of ADM's greatest competitive advantages is the breadth and integration of our business model, reaching from farm to fork. 2023 has offered several examples that of how we are creating new areas of growth in each business units. On the farm, ADM has one of the largest and most sophisticated global origination networks, connecting with hundreds of thousand farmer partners worldwide. We have unique and deep relationships with the people and technologies that are shaping the future of agriculture. So as more of our customers are looking for traceable, sustainable crop sources in their own supply chains, we are a natural connector and influencer. We are proud to have announced partnership with PepsiCo, Nestle and Carlsberg, and have a target of 4 million regenerative acres and goal by 2025. The carbon equivalent of power in more than 100,000 homes a year. Moving into production, as the pace of energy transition accelerates, demand for renewables fuel sources is growing rapidly and ADM is in a leading position to capitalize on this trend. With our Spiritwood JV with Marathon currently being commissioned, we are ready to fit the production of a targeted 75 million gallons of renewable green diesel per year. We have announced the Broadwing Energy Project, delivering lower emission power source and a critical part of lowering our carbon emissions used to power Decatur operations. And we're innovating to deliver a new low-carbon intensity products within the fast growing BioSolutions portfolio. And as we connect to the consumer, we're working closely with our customers to serve the challenges of their consumers, whether it's sustainable solutions, the latest flavor or a cost effective ingredient replacement or explore in the future of nutrition through work with ADM Ventures partners like Air Protein and Nourished. And we have differentiated our offerings with the next-generation of evidence-based health and wellness solution. With the world's largest probiotic manufacturing facility in Valencia, more than 50 clinical trials underway and a growing team of deep scientific experts, we are well positioned for the expanding demand for functional foods and personalized nutrition. And to efficiently execute on all areas of growth while maintaining an efficient cost structure, we continue to vigilantly focus on productivity, as well as the culture that let our ADM colleagues bring their best every day. Across our global organization, we're standardizing processes and systems through One ADM and modernizing our operations through digital transformation, driving greater efficiencies while enabling the best use of our workforce and production capacity. Our planned modernization program continues to deliver impressive operational benefits, including advanced analytics and safety improvements across the 17 operations facilities currently in implementation phase. With more than 70 plants in the scope, the planned recurring cost savings associated with automation across our footprint in 2024 is already nearing $20 million per year. Our cultural efforts are the critical foundation for all of these strategic initiatives. We have ramped up our focus on a culture of caring, specifically in regards to the safety of our colleagues. This is our top priority. And our recent performance in this area has not lived up to our expectations. We are committed to taking action to improve and have already begun to do so with the assistance of both internal and external experts. We will do better. By actively managing productivity, innovation and culture and aligning work to the interconnected trends in food security, health and wellbeing and sustainability, ADM is well positioned for sustainable long-term profit growth across new and adjacent avenues. And with the strong performance in 2023 and a constructive expectation for the remainder of the year, we are again raising our full-year earnings outlook. For a deeper look at our Q3 performance, let me hand over to Vikram, who will cover results of operations. Thank you, Vikram. As we close today's call, let me share a few thoughts about how we're seeing our efforts in 2023 position ADM to continue solid progression into 2024. External factors that influence ADM's forward look are closely aligned to the enduring macro trends we have positioned ourselves to be nimble in managing. We continue to see the interconnectivity across food security, health and well-being and sustainability having an amplifying effect across the industries we serve. More frequent extreme weather, extreme weather, geopolitical events and the recent pandemic have all highlighted the criticality of food security within those geographies and for the regions that are served by their agricultural exports. Connected to this, we see areas of supply abundance growing as evidenced by Brazil's record recent crop cycles and areas of need shifting. In some cases, this has resulted in either more domestic consumption in countries like the U.S. or elevated import demand situations where our unparalleled global asset base and deep experience are critical. Government policies beginning to support new demand patterns, whether based on a move to more renewable energy sources or an effort to increase regenerative agriculture supply. Science continues to accelerate innovation in Nutrition with an ever-present consumer interest in turning their food, beverage and supplement consumption to their personal health and dietary needs. Beyond the challenges and opportunities connected to these external factors, we believe ADM is positioned to leverage productivity and innovation to build momentum in the coming year, a continuation of the strategic efforts we have been driving throughout 2023. We anticipate our Services and Oilseeds continue to leverage its extended value chain and deliver structural changes to demand. We anticipate that crush margins will remain healthy while our productivity measures enable us to have a more efficient cost structure. We continue to drive opportunistic extension of our destination marketing scope, grow our regenerative agriculture acres and partnerships, and expand our renewable fuels feedstock production. In Carb Solutions, the compounding effects of our transformative investments coupled with early contracting for starches and sweeteners and what we believe to be a positive ethanol environment are setting up for another strong year in 2024. For Nutrition, we expect continued growth in our revenue opportunity pipeline with significant conversions continuing as we move past some near-term demand weakness. Our expanding results in flavors continue to signal acceleration across our broader portfolio. We expect the positive revenue growth trends in Health & Wellness to drive into next year, and we're already pivoting Specialty Ingredients towards high potential areas like alternative daily and specialized nutrition. Our actions in Animal Nutrition are delivering a positive impact and sustained opportunity growth, which we believe will expand further through the segment in the coming year. And by applying our commercial excellence efforts to this portfolio, we are focusing on the value of innovation in the specialty parts of the business. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness. With the momentum we have been building upon the foundation for growth we have established, I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pave a path for long-term profit growth. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. Listen, our perspective have not changed. If anything, the perspective that we have for the market has been confirmed by what we're saying. Of course, it's a very dynamic environment with the market trying to balance a lot of issues, whether it's more availability of products, more demand, the Argentine situation. We have seen board crush explode back to near the highs recently. And this is just only a reflection of the incredible demand that is coming for soybean meal into the U.S. This drives the board crush has -- it was mill driven maybe before it was oil driven, this was mill driven. You see Argentina situation, they are getting to the end of their inventory. There are probably enough beans at this point for crushers to run until November. So what we see the export book of the U.S. for soybean meal is a record export book from the U.S., something that is higher than over the last 10 years. So I think that, that will continue well into Q1 of 2024. And fundamentally, what has changed, and you have that, if you were island of strong crush margins in the U.S. is this demand for oil. We see crush margins have been a little bit lower for soybean, certainly in Brazil or in Europe, and it's because some of the oil prices have declined. But in the U.S. with the new demand for renewable green diesel and the new \u2013 all the new capacity coming, we expect that to remain strong for years to come. So we will continue to be very constructive at our crush margins in the U.S. You're welcome. Yeah. Thank you, Tom. Listen, North America refining margins are lower in this quarter. I think if you look at last year, the high priced oils were impacted by supply chain disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war. So I would say this is a more normalized environment. We have also some positive timing impacts due to the pronounced RIN and HVO market movements, pulling forward some of those gains. I would say when we look at the forward quarter, we see remain refining margins to remain strong, but maybe a decline from the elevated highs we saw in 2022 on the early part of this year. Biodiesel margins are also coming out of the highs, as maybe the RIN value component of margin has declined as the industry is building a bank of rings. So we still have not seen a significant pull from the RD demand that it's been building but we maintain our expectation of how much it's going to be built there. So we think that is coming. The other thing you need to think about oil is that demand for food oil is very strong and has rebounded. And there are expectations now that with El Nino, we might have and with the natural maturity of the plantations in the -- in Southeast Asia that we might have a little bit less supply of palm oil and all that. So although, we are coming off the highs, we continue to be constructive about margin stabilizing at a strong level in the RPO area. Yeah. Thank you, Ben. Good question. Listen, we see 2024 with a lot of optimism. We're working through the plan right now, as you can imagine at this time of the year. We continue to see the strength of Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carb Solutions continuing. Ag Services and Oilseeds, we have seen some fundamental structural changes. And I think that that's a multiyear trend. So we're going to see higher crush margins, at least in the United States for quite a while. And our Ag Services business continued to grow around the world in the -- with the strength of destination marketing and that exacerbated concern about food security that bring -- brought by all the geopolitics and the weather events and the pandemic and all that continues and continue to enhance margins for us to the service we provide around the world. So we see that business being very solid and very strong contributor. Carb Solutions, I think that Vikram touched a little bit on the dynamics of the contracting for next year. But beyond that, I think that you have to remember that we are having different uses. We are finding new demand for those products that will do two things, will grow as revenue into new categories like, we're seeing in BioSolutions that is growing double-digits. But it's also going to tighten up the supply for the existing products. So that will be constructive to margins over time, and we've seen that already, so those are the two. And I think Nutrition and Vikram went into a lot of detail into that and all the different pieces. And we're very confident we're going to go back to growth next year. This year, maybe you call it the past that refreshes, we took a pause this year. But the fundamental innovation engine that we have, that's our differentiation. That continues to resonate strongly, whether it's in Health & Wellness in what we are seeing in Flavors or the specialty pieces of Animal Nutrition or the demand generation impact, where the markets are normal and we apply that properly, we are winning more than our fair share, and we're growing faster than the competitors. So we see that with a lot of optimism for next year. When we think about how that correlates to our thinking of how to deploy capital, the priority to deploying capital is in our investment plan, and we have been doing that both in OpEx and in CapEx.

Of course, we're a global company, we see that becoming 7 billion to 8 billion gallons by maybe -- and maybe 14 billion, 15 billion gallons of renewable green diesel and SAF online by 2026 and 2027. So we are at the very early innings of all these biofuel demand that is coming, whether it's again for renewable green diesel or the promise of decarbonization that SAF brings to aviation that it doesn't have any other valid options right now. So again, we're going to be a player that speedy good shows that. We're going to bring 1.5 million tons of capacity that will feed 75 million gallons of RGV. So we expect the others will deliver as we have delivered Spiritwood. So this is an industry we're building that we're excited about. You're welcome."

The Ag Services and Oilseeds team once again delivered solid results in an increasingly dynamic environment by leveraging our experience, scale and integrated global footprint. Ag Services results were lower than the strong third quarter of 2022. South American origination results were higher year-over-year as our team delivered significantly higher volumes and margins on strong export demand. Prior investments in port capabilities have enabled us to structurally grow our earnings while capitalizing on a stronger margin environment across the region. North American results were lower year-over-year as a result of the shift of export demand to Brazil, due to the large crop there as well as low water levels in the U.S. river system, limiting volume and barge capacity. Effective risk management, combined with higher volumes and margins in Global trade led to strong results. However, much lower than the record quarter last year. The current quarter also included a $48 million insurance settlement related to damages from Hurricane Ida. In Crushing, we delivered another strong quarter, but lower than the prior year as global crush margins remained healthy, but lower than the very strong levels of a year ago. Our strong results were led by North America, as the crush margin environment remains well supported by structurally higher demand for vegetable oils. We officially opened our new crush facility in Spiritwood, North Dakota to meet growing demand. We are currently in the commissioning process and expected to be running at full rates in early November, adding an additional 1.5 million metric tons of crush capacity per year. In EMEA, we continue to optimize our flex capacity to prioritize crush of higher margin softseed, in line with market opportunities. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects which were lower than the net positive impacts in the prior year quarter. Refined Products and other posted another strong quarter, higher than the prior year period, results were led by solid volumes and margins in North America. In EMEA, robust export demand for biodiesel and domestic demand for food oil drove higher results versus the prior year. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects, which are expected to reverse as contracts execute in future periods. Equity earnings from Wilmar was significantly lower versus the third quarter of 2022. Looking ahead, for the fourth quarter in Ag Services and Oilseeds, we anticipate strong results that are slightly lower than last year, excluding the $110 million legal settlement in the ag services subsegment from the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect Ag Services results to be in line with the prior year, excluding the legal settlement. We anticipate similar year-over-year North American export volumes, a competitive South American export program and continued strong performance from global trade. We forecast our crushing subsegment will deliver strong results similar to the prior year. We expect robust soy and canola crush margins and with the ramping of our Spiritwood operations higher volumes. We expect RPO to perform well, but be significantly below last year as positive timing impacts from prior quarters are expected to reverse. Slide 6, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered an outstanding quarter that was significantly higher than the prior year, enabled by the ongoing optimization of our production and supply chain network. The starches and sweeteners subsegment were higher year-over-year on a healthy demand and strong margin environment across starches, sweeteners, wheat flour and ethanol. Our team generated new customer wins and delivered double-digit growth year-to-date in our BioSolutions platform. As Juan touched on earlier, we also signed a formal agreement with Broadwing Energy to provide lower emissions power to Decatur facility, extending our ability to provide low carbon solutions across the value chain. In the Vantage Corn Processors subsegment, our team executed well in a strong ethanol demand and margin environment, leading to significantly higher year-over-year results. Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect steady demand and margins for our starches, sweeteners and wheat flower products. We remain constructive on ethanol margins driven by solid domestic demand and healthy U.S. exports, supported by lower competing exports from Brazil due to higher sugar prices. We anticipate results to be similar to the prior year period, but with upside potential if the current ethanol margin structure holds. On Slide 7. In Nutrition, strong results in Flavors, health and wellness and recovery in the base Animal Nutrition business were more than offset by continued lower demand for plant-based proteins and persistent demand fulfillment challenges in pet solutions. Flavors reported impressive results in a complex operating environment, delivering a 29% growth in operating profit on a constant currency basis. Results were led by pricing actions in EMEA and strong win rates in North America. During the quarter, we also implemented a successful go-live of our One ADM project in the EMEA region across 18 locations in 12 countries. This represents a significant milestone as we continue to harness digital across the enterprise to drive productivity gains. In Specialty Ingredients, weak market demand, particularly in the alternate meat category, inventory adjustments and unplanned downtime resulting from the recent Decatur incident led to significantly lower year-over-year results. The plant-based protein market has been experiencing destocking and consumer demand softness over the course of the year that will likely persist into next year. Given these recent market dynamics, we have re-scoped our Decatur protein modernization investment project to better match the expected lower growth demand environment. Also, we are leveraging our expertise in creation, design and development to differentiate our product offerings to serve evolving consumer needs. These adjustments will enable a faster pivot to higher growth and more resilient categories such as specialized nutrition, which have synergies across the nutrition portfolio, and we are rapidly building this revenue pipeline. Health & Wellness results were higher year-over-year due to double-digit bioactives sales and a favorable impact related to the revised commercial agreement with Spiber. During the quarter, we realized a significant expansion in our revenue pipeline, reinforcing the demand for evidence-based solutions. In Animal Nutrition, we are beginning to see the cost optimization actions and the expansion of offerings in the specialty feed and ingredient space from earlier this year, driving improved performance. However, the recovery in the base business was more than offset by normalized year-over-year amino acids margins as well as lower profit contribution from the Pet Solutions business. Looking forward, we anticipate flavors to finish the year strong, driven by growth in EMEA and North America. Health & wellness operating profit is expected to finish similar to last year. Animal Nutrition operating profit is expected to continue to recover sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Specialty Ingredients operating profit is expected to be down significantly, impacted by the recent Decatur East incident and demand softness. All in, we now expect full year 2023 operating profit for Nutrition to be around $600 million. While our results in 2023 have been below our expectations, we expect nutrition to return to growth in 2024. We will continue to build on the Flavors momentum from 2023. Health & wellness should maintain its steady performance. The cost actions in the shopper pivot to higher-margin products will enable Animal Nutrition to drive growth, further reinforced by improved go-to-market capabilities. Lastly, for SI, we will work aggressively to restart operational capabilities at Decatur East to minimize the impact in 2024. Slide 8, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher net interest income. Captive insurance results were slightly lower on higher claim settlements partially offset by premiums from new programs. In corporate results, net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year, primarily on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs of $298 million were higher versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support our digital transformation efforts. Other corporate was favorable versus the prior year, primarily due to foreign currency hedges. We still forecast corporate cost to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was approximately 20% higher than the prior year primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. Through the third quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $3.8 billion. We continue to invest in the business, allocating $1.1 billion to capital expenditures and have returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We have ample liquidity with over $13 billion of cash and available credit, and our balance sheet is very strong, with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9. Our fortress balance sheet gives us the financial flexibility to drive our long-term strategic agenda while also returning capital to shareholders and is also a competitive advantage, particularly in a higher for longer interest rate environment. We have completed $1.1 billion of share repurchases through Q3 and expect to increase the pace of repurchases in Q4. Even with the softness in nutrition, and lower-than-expected profit contributions from Wilmar. We are raising our 2023 earnings outlook again and now anticipate full year EPS in excess of $7 per share. Juan? Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ben. So let's take it by different business lines. So in flavors, as I mentioned, Q3 had a very strong performance. And if you actually look year-to-date, Flavors operating profit is up 16%. And I think that's been a very important growth engine, and typically, the sales cycle in Flavors tends to be shorter than some of our other product portfolios. So just keep that in mind, that momentum is building and we see that momentum through our revenue pipeline, which is increasing month-over-month, we anticipate momentum in Q4 and frankly, continuing into 2024. The other aspect is EBITDA margins of Flavors is also increasing. It's not just revenue growth. The profit is also as a consequence of EBITDA margin expansion. And finally, Flavors contribution year-to-date overall as a part of nutrition profitability is a little over 50%. So important to keep that as a back of your mind as we think about the future. The second part of the Human Nutrition business, Health & Wellness. Health & Wellness have been steady. Actually, the dietary supplements market, which was a little bit of a headwind has -- we see the destocking tend to see the bit, and we are optimistic about the outlook next year. The other thing that Juan mentioned is the evidence-based portfolio of ingredients is expanding and our ability to apply that into functional food and solutions gives us confidence and that business to continue growing into next year and beyond. Specialty Ingredients. Actually, it's a tale of two cities within Specialty Ingredients. There's a texturants (ph) portfolio that has done exceptionally well because of expansion of margins. We don't talk much about that, but because it's a smaller part of the business, but that has performed exceptionally well this year. The challenge has been on the plant-based protein market. And the plant-based protein is driven by market softness, right? There is a softness in the market, and we've gone down as a consequence of what's happening in the market. What we are doing from that perspective is pivoting the portfolio into some of the more resilient categories like specialized nutrition like or to dairy. It doesn't happen overnight. But remember, we -- through our CD&E capabilities, it allows us to pivot our product portfolio into the categories that are growing, and we will do that. We are in the process of doing that. What happened in the interim is the Decatur East incident. What that's created is a challenge in terms of white flake production for specialty proteins in North America. So that's been a drag that we clearly had not foreseen and that drag is going to continue into 2024. So within Human Nutrition, Flavors performing exceptionally well outpacing the market, Health & Wellness study, SI is kind of in line with market, further exacerbated by the recent Decatur East incident. Then step into Animal Nutrition, what happens with amino acids. We were coming off very high margins in 2022. The good news is, we are going to reset in a much more normalized margin levels in 2023. So therefore, '24 onwards, we won't have that lapping impact of higher amino acid margins. But if you exclude amino acid margins, the base Animal Nutrition business, excluding pet solutions, we talked about all the actions of business is undertaking to optimize costs as well as drive focus on Specialty Ingredients, that is being recognized in performance. We are seeing the benefits of that and you'll see sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. So that, we feel very good about this in Q4 as well as going forward. Ag Solutions, demand creation remains solid, that category has been fantastic. We've had challenges in demand fulfillment in North America, and particularly, we talked about that primarily in the recent acquisition that we did in 2021. Those are still lingering, but we have very clear action plans, and we feel confident that by the end of this year and early next year, we will be able to more than offset that. So all in all, combined with that a new innovation, we feel pretty confident that nutrition will return to growth in 2024. And albeit maybe at a slightly lower growth rate than we had anticipated before. But getting to $1 billion is definitely within the horizon. It may not happen in the next year or in year falling, but definitely in the near term or in the medium term. About $95 million. So on the Carb Solutions question, Adam, I think it's important to just frame it. The liquid sweetener volumes have been steady. And this has happened throughout this year. Almost every quarter, we've said that. So the demand has been pretty resilient, and the margin structure has been strong. The other thing that's actually helpful is strong exports to Mexico as well as higher sugar prices. The specialty volumes in North America have been a bit soft, but with the improved mix and pricing, our margins have actually expanded. The BioSolutions market, we're actually extending into new applications, and that revenue growth year-to-date is 23%. Wheat flour demand has been resilient. The optimization I referred to in my comments, has actually helped improve the cost structure and expand margins. As on all you know what's going on in ethanol. It as goes, the margin structure there is very supportive given domestic demand, blend economics, strong U.S. exports, as well as the fact that we've got a significant -- actually higher domestic driving miles. Now when you think about next year, I mean we're well set up for the Q4 '23, and I already talked about that. It's a little early to say, but based on the strong finish that we anticipated in 2023, and early '24 contracting in North America, sweeter and starches, we are optimistic for solid volumes and our ability to actually maintain and potentially even expand margins in our core starches and sweeteners portfolio. We'll tell you more in our February call, but going in, the outlook is constructive and similarly for ethanol, that tends to be volatile. But right now, the general trends to be supportive of a higher-for-longer ethanol margin environment. Yeah. I think also in terms of buybacks, good to remind everyone that if you remember in our 2021 Investor Day, we talked about $5 billion of buybacks over the next four years through 2025. If you combine what we've done last year and this year, we've done almost about $2.6 billion of buyback, so we are ahead of that pace. And as I mentioned in my comments and as Juan said, if we don't see compelling valuations and given our discipline, we probably at these trading levels, price levels, we probably are going to buy back a little more aggressively, and you probably will see a stronger pace of buybacks in Q4 as a consequence of some of those factors. Thank you, Ben. Well, so I think the first thing to note is, when in Q2, we said around $7 for potential -- with potential for more upside. And what we have seen saying right now is that potential upside is coming through, and that's why we're raising our guidance in excess of $7. But if you step back, Steven, think about what's happened between Q2 and Q3. One is, clearly, nutrition has been softer. We had guided to it similar in Q2. Now we are guiding to around $600 million. So you know, by definition, there's a compensation in other parts of the business. And when you think about the compensation relative to our Q2, that's probably going to come partially from AS&O and partially from CS. And we gave some guidance on AS&O for Q4 and also some guidance for CS. CS to be rough relatively flat versus Q4, barring any continued expansion in ethanol margins, so that could be upside in CS. And in AS&O, we have some puts and takes in RPO in particular, and one went through this. We expect that to be weaker than Q4 of last year just because we expect these mark-to-market timing gains we realized in Q3 to be rolling off. And then in Ag Services, it's going to be generally flat, excluding the legal settlement that was a onetime thing in Q4 of last year. And then in crush, it's going to be strong. And I think Juan talked about that we are continuing to be constructive about the cross outlook particularly in the U.S. going forward, given some of the structural demand changes related to renewable green diesel in particular."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the ADM Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\nMegan Britt: Thank you, Alex. Hello, and welcome to the second quarter earnings webcast for ADM. Starting tomorrow, a replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website. Please turn to Slide 2. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risk and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted, under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. On today\u2019s webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will discuss our second quarter results, share progress highlights on our first half accomplishment and provide perspective on our outlook for the second half. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar, will review segment level performance for the quarter and first half and provide an update on our cash generation and capital allocation actions. Juan will have some closing remarks, and then he and Vikram will take your questions. Please turn to Slide 3. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Megan, and thanks to those who have joined us for today's call. Today, ADM reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.6 billion. Combined with first quarter results, this equates to a first half adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 and an adjusted operating profit of $3.4 billion. Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13.8%. The first half of 2023 has probably unfolded as we expected and our financial performance nearly replicates the record results from the first half of last year, even as we face a more challenging macroeconomic and demand environment to start the year. Through active positioning, strong margin management and leveraging our geographically diverse end-to-end supply chain network, we maintain our earnings power and a strong ROIC performance bolstered by key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise. Please turn to Slide 4. Let me highlight just a few across the business. In Ag Services & Oilseeds, our team leveraged past investments in port capabilities to produce record origination volumes out of our Brazilian facilities, expanded our regenerative agriculture partnerships and leverage our ability to flex crush capacity to capitalize on higher canola crush margins. In the latter instance, we flexed more than 300,000 tons of capacity and captured an additional $40 per metric ton of margin. In Carbohydrate Solutions, strategic investments in optimization and modernization allowed our team to manage increased demand for liquid sweeteners, drive growth in BioSolutions revenue and operating profit and produced record results in our milling and international corn businesses. In Nutrition, our unique go-to-market strategy continues to drive a larger sales pipeline and deliver double-digit growth in the Flavors business, thanks to an impressive performance in EMEA and new wins in North America. When you combine all of these aspects across ADM's full business portfolio, it's clear how we are able to convert challenges in one geography, product or business segment into value drivers in another. Next slide, please. Let's review the factors that we see as important drivers for a strong second half finish in 2023. We expect continued strength in Brazil origination for the remainder of the year. Our past strategic investments in port facilities in Brazil optimize origination network and deep connection to our global trade and destination marketing teams will allow us to export strong volumes, capitalizing on the record Brazilian soybean and corn crops. Biofuels demand continues to remain strong. Through the first half of the year, we saw robust margins from biodiesel, strong demand for ethanol and an increasing demand for vegetable oil from renewable green diesel and we expect this trends to continue in the second half. Our Spiritwood, North Dakota processing facilities is scheduled to start up in Q4, adding 1.5 million metric tons of annual soy crush capacity to our portfolio and producing low carbon intensity soybean oil for our JV partner Marathon's nearby renewable diesel facility. Projects like this will support growing demand for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel throughout the industry. We also see continued resilience in food demand for core products. We expect the continued solid margin and volume environment for sweeteners, starches and flours. We are beginning to convert our pipeline of wins in Human Nutrition into operating profit. Well, there are some factors that have hindered growth in the portfolio, we believe positive momentum from Flavors is a predictor of a healthy rebound. We also see continued commodity market dislocations in the second half. ADM has the unique ability to execute with agility in a dynamic environment. Our team utilizes our unparalleled global asset footprint and end-to-end supply chain to adapt to evolving market conditions and meet global food security needs while driving strong returns. Lastly, our balance sheet remains healthy, and we are flexing it toward organic investments and opportunistic share buybacks. We continue to deploy capital to drive organic productivity and innovation-oriented programs such as Spiritwood, Valencia and Marshall as well as invest in our plant automation efforts and our broad decarbonization initiatives. And our $1 billion in share repurchases in the first half highlights our confidence in the strong cash generation and growth potential of our company. As we look at the back half of the year, we intend to continue our share repurchase program. We feel that these factors are fundamental drivers of our strong second half performance. I am proud of how our team has delivered halfway through the year and even more excited about the opportunities presented in the second half and what our team can deliver. Taking collectively, we are raising our earnings expectations for full year 2023. With that, let me turn it over to Vikram, who will go into more detail on the results of operations. Vikram?\nVikram Luthar: Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 6. The Ag Services & Oilseeds team continues to deliver exceptional results in a dynamic environment, leading to an extremely strong performance in the first half of 2023, surpassing the outstanding first half of the prior year. Q2 results were strong, but slightly below the prior year period. Ag Services results were in line with the strong second quarter of 2022. South American origination results were higher year-over-year as the team delivered record volumes and higher margins on strong export demand, leveraging our strategic investments to expand port capacity to capitalize on the record Brazilian soybean crop. Results for North America origination was slightly lower year-over-year, driven by lower export volumes due to large South America suppliers. Our execution in destination marketing as well as effective risk management continue to deliver strong global trade results, though lower than the record quarter last year. In our crushing subsegment, results were much lower than the record result from the second quarter last year. Global soy crush margins remained strong but were lower year-over-year in all regions due to softer demand for both meal and oil and a tight U.S. soybean carryout. This was partially offset by strong softseed margins and higher volumes supported by a strong Canadian canola crop and use of our flex capacity in EMEA. Additionally, there were approximately $195 million of negative mark-to-market timing effects in the current quarter that are expected to reverse as the contracts execute in future periods. Refined products and other results were significantly higher than the prior year period, achieving a record second quarter. North America results were higher, driven by strong food oil demand and improved biodiesel volumes. In EMEA, strong export demand for biodiesel and domestic food oil demand supported stronger margins. Additionally, there were approximately $90 million of positive mark-to-market timing effects in the current quarter that are expected to reverse as the contracts execute in future periods. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the second quarter of 2022. Looking ahead for the third quarter, we anticipate solid results in Ag Services & Oilseeds. We expect strong demand for grain exports to be heavily weighted towards South America and our Brazilian origination footprint. We anticipate strong volumes and margins for soy and canola crush based on the tight Argentine crop and improving demand outlook for meal and oil. We expect RPO to perform well but have significant reversals of timing impacts from the second quarter, leading to lower net execution margins. Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered strong results in Q2, but lower than the record second quarter of last year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, capitalized on a solid demand environment during the quarter. North America Starches and Sweeteners delivered volumes and margins similar to the prior years, and ethanol margins were solid as industry stocks moderated but lower relative to the prior year. Q2 results were negatively impacted due to unplanned downtime at one of our corn germ plants. In EMEA, the team effectively managed margins to deliver improved results. The global wheat milling business posted higher margins, supported by steady customer demand. BioSolutions continued on its excellent growth trajectory with 22% revenue growth year-over-year. Vantage Corn Processors results were lower due to lower year-over-year ethanol margins. The prior year period also includes a onetime $50 million benefit from the USDA biofuel producer recovery program. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to decarbonize the Carbohydrate Solutions footprint including our definitive agreement with Tallgrass to sequester carbon from our Columbus, Nebraska facility and continued progress on decarbonizing our decade complex through additional carbon capture and sequestration wells, as well as ultra-low-carbon intensity, electricity and steam generation. These are key steps in enabling us to produce low CI feedstocks for use in many applications for our major CPG customers and underpinning our growth opportunities, such as SAS, BioSolutions and our lactic acid polylactic acid joint venture with LG Chem. Looking ahead for the third quarter, we expect continued steady demand in margins for our starches, sweeteners and wheat flour products. Ethanol margins are also expected to remain solid. On Slide 8, Nutrition results were significantly lower than the prior year's record quarter. Human Nutrition results were slightly up year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our Flavors business posted record results in Q2, growing revenues and EBITDA margins due to improved mix and pricing in EMEA, as well as improving demand in North America. Flavors will be a significant growth engine for Human Nutrition for the remainder of the year and will act as a pace setter for the rest of our portfolio. Customer innovation in beverage is beginning to accelerate, and our value proposition is driving our sales pipeline to its largest ever. Growth in Flavors was offset by lower year-over-year results in Specialty Ingredients. While there has been softening of demand for plant-based proteins, particularly for the alternative meat space, other categories like alternative dairy snacks and baked goods as well as specialized nutrition are providing growth opportunities. Although still a small OP contributor, Health and Wellness is seeing demand recovery in probiotics and is benefiting from geographic expansion opportunities offered through ADM's global footprint and customer relationships. Our largest challenge in 2023 has been in the Animal Nutrition business were significantly lower amino acid margins and softer global feed demand has affected volumes driving much lower results. Over the past several months, we have made important adjustments to align the business to this environment, including simplifying our brands and go-to-market strategy, consolidating facilities and optimizing our footprint, rightsizing the workforce in association with these changes and aligning the reporting structure to enhance synergies. We are also refocusing our efforts to increase offerings in the higher-margin specialty feed and ingredients areas. We believe these actions will lead to improved commercial and operational performance, supporting profitable growth when market fundamentals improve. When looking at Nutrition as a whole, we now expect 2023 results to be similar to the prior years, as we expect growth in Human Nutrition to be offset by lower results in Animal Nutrition. However, given the increase in customer innovation we've seen in our Flavors business and our recent wins in pipeline growth across Human Nutrition, as well as the actions we are taking in Animal Nutrition, we remain confident about the future outlook and growth prospects for Nutrition. Slide 9, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher net interest income. Captive insurance improved on premiums from new programs, partially offset by increased claim settlements. In corporate results, net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year, primarily on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs of $262 million was similar versus the prior year as lower health insurance costs were offset by increased global technology spend. Other corporate was unfavorable versus the prior year, primarily due to foreign currency hedges. We still project corporate costs to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was -- of 2023 was approximately 18%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. Through the second quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $2.5 billion. We allocated $600 million to capital expenditures as well as returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to have ample liquidity with nearly $13 billion of cash and available credit, and our leverage ratio are low with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 1.0. Our strong balance sheet and credit ratings provide a stable financial footing for ADM to pursue our strategic growth initiatives while also returning capital to shareholders. We still anticipate $1.3 billion of capital expenditures in 2023. As Juan mentioned, we have already completed the $1 billion of share repurchases that we announced in January this year. We intend to continue our share repurchase program, subject to other strategic uses of capital. Based on our very strong first half, we are raising our full year earnings outlook to around $7 per share with potential for even more upside. Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vikram. As we wrap up today's call, let me highlight a few opportunities that we're excited about as ADM continues to execute our strategic agenda, where we're seeing value generation today and have plans to accelerate. Let's start with digitization and automation. Our ongoing work to modernize and automate our operations is ramping up. Our eight current implementations across North America and Europe are generating millions in run rate benefits. And we have 10 more starting in Q3 with the expectation of similar scalable benefits. Our 1ADM program is accelerating our decision-making and analytics capabilities across the company, helping us find faster path to productivity. With our HR systems now in place globally, our next milestone is bringing part of the Nutrition flavors business on board. In LatAm, we have implemented technology to optimize trade and commercial processes while digitizing freight and logistics contracting. All of this is helping us reduce costs and make better, faster decisions to deliver value to ADM and our customers. Sustainability and decarbonization have opened new avenues for growth across the enterprise while ensuring we are taking the necessary actions on our own footprint. Our STRIVE 35 program continues to deliver important progress, and our recent sustainability report shows our efforts in greenhouse gas emissions, waste reduction, no deforestation and crop traceability achieving targets ahead of plan. As we continue to support our most significant customers with carbon advantage crop sources, we recently announced regenerative Ag program targets of 2 million acres in 2023 with an additional 2 million acres by 2025. With the recent Tallgrass agreement and permit submissions, CO2 from ADM facilities in Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois is now targeted to be captured and stored safely and permanently underground within our expand indicator CCS well capacity. This helps decarbonize our customers' value chains and our own across important opportunity spaces like BioSolutions and sustainable aviation fuel. And we are continuing to invest in the next phase of innovation. Our new Decatur protein solution center is engaged in ADM's world-class science and technology capabilities to deliver on tomorrow's most important consumer nutrition trends. Collaboration between ADM and our ventures partners take us beyond today's alternative protein sources to help address critical areas of sustainability, wellness and affordability. Leveraging our deep fermentation expertise and capacity is positioning us to scale the next generation of food, feed, fuel, fabrics and other industrial products with key partners. The combination of technology alongside global trends in sustainability, food security and well-being is transforming the food and agriculture industry at the fastest pace since the last century. And ADM is at the forefront of this transformation and connected growth opportunities, which give us even more confidence in our long-range growth plans. Thank you for your time today. Vikram and I look forward to your questions. Alex, please open the line.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Ben, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Thank you very much. Good morning, Juan. Good morning, Vikram.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning.\nVikram Luthar: Good morning.\nBen Theurer: So I'd like to -- just a general question on obviously, like the puts and takes. You're raising your guidance at the higher end of what 6% to 7% was now around 7%. And obviously, you had a very strong first half, but then at the same time, you're looking for a little more softness in Nutrition. So maybe help us understand how you feel about just macro picture in general demand? What are the geopolitical assumptions that you have behind your outlook and how you feel about second half and then also beyond maybe into 2024, as it relates to general demand in an environment where we're in right now. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Sure, Ben. Yes, of course, first of all, we're very proud of the results we accomplished in the quarter and in the first half. And certainly, we are more confident about the environment ahead of us for ADM. I would say -- let me highlight some of the reasons for that. Certainly, crush margins have started to pick up as we predicted before. They continue to get better. Board crush has been firmer and mill basis has been stronger and BIM basis have dropped in the U.S. as we have anticipated. I think there is a shift in which the world needs more protein, then we need more mill, and we can cover for Argentina shortcomings this year. So that is happening as we predicted. And certainly, it's going to be very good for Q3 and Q4. I think we're seeing these huge crops in Brazil. We see the Brazilian port congestion driving a lower interior basis and allowing us to procure cheaper grains, giving margins to those companies that have invested in the infrastructure to be able to capitalize on that, which we did, both in Santos and in Barcarena in Brazil. So, that's playing very well for us. The last time we talked, ethanol inventories were around 25 million to 26 million barrels. Now we are at the end of June at about 22 million. There is -- we see a strong spot demand for ethanol and corn tough to buy. So that has made margins strengthen, and they are holding. So we are positive about ethanol margins continued in that regard. We continue to see this trend in biofuels and we have a strong book on biodiesel for the quarter. So we feel good about that. We are seeing lower recession challenges and the U.S. consumer very resilient, and that's bringing resiliency in our core products for food demand. And we see that in carb solutions, whether it's sweeteners and starches or whether it's in milling. So as you highlighted, of course, and Vikram went deep into that, the issues in Nutrition, I would say we feel good about how our value proposition continues to resonate in flavors. Flavors is more beverage kind of business, if you will. The innovation happens a little bit faster there. So we see our pipeline continues to grow. That bodes very well for what we know the potential revenue is in 2024. So again, we continue to align the company to these big three trends, food security that with all the geopolitics and the weather makes ADM assets more valuable and gives us more margin in destination marketing services, for example. We see health and well-being, and that continues to show in all the flavors innovation that we're seeing with our customers. And we see the sustainability trend driving all these opportunities in decarbonization. I would say we shouldn't forget when we mentioned this, that either in automation on decarbonization, we are at the early innings of multiyear progress for the industry and for ADM. So I think that we feel very good about '23 and we feel even better about the future.\nBen Theurer: Perfect. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question for today comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Ben, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBen Bienvenu: Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to just follow-up just on the -- good morning, on the Nutrition business and maybe to the extent that you can talk a little bit about the cadence as we move through the back half of the year. I appreciate the updated comments on overall results being flat year-over-year. But there's -- with Animal Nutrition expected to be down year-over-year, there's a pretty substantial ramp in the human side of things. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the visibility that you have into that? And then to the extent you can parse between 3Q and 4Q as you see it today, that would be helpful.\nVikram Luthar: Yes, Ben. So I think let's just take a few minutes to talk about why our guide has gone from 10% growth to flat. Animal Nutrition cyclical weakness is persisting for longer than we anticipated. Consumers continue to trade down from higher value, more feed intensive to lower value, less feed intensive proteins. Reformulation to reduce feed cost is also impacting volumes. Plant-based proteins, particularly in the alternative meats continues to be softer than anticipated. The destocking actually is still continuing in that category. And the broader market growth has also moderated, which we had signaled before. Third, the demand fulfillment challenge in pet solutions are taking longer than anticipated resolve. The delay was driven primarily by slower than anticipated integration of the recent small business acquisition that we made in North America. And if you remember, we had COVID, and that delayed also the integration. So we're working through that. But what are we doing? And that's important as you think about the back half as well as the future. Flavors. Strong pipeline and win rates. We talked about the largest ever pipeline we've had. Flavors actually grew profits in the first half 9%, 20% in Q2. So that's a very good sign of the recovery we are seeing in parts of the Human Nutrition business. The other thing that's important to note, Flavors actually contributed almost 50% of the overall operating profit for Nutrition in the first half. So that's an important signal as you think about the future growth of Nutrition. Yes, that was primarily driven in the beverage category, but we see green shoots of opportunity in the food category as well. In the SI side, we are leveraging our CD&D capabilities to accelerate penetration into some of the faster-growing categories. I mentioned alternative spaces, alternative meat has been soft but alternative dairy and some of the other categories actually growing. And we are launching our Decatur protein innovation center in Q3. All that, given our CD&D capabilities allows us to pivot to categories that are growing. And that sometimes takes time. So we anticipate that recovery possibly to come in more in the 2024 time frame, less in the back half of this year. In Animal Nutrition, we are taking actions to improve margins, cost and product and footprint rationalization to improve margins and also to drive profitable growth as the markets recover. So we feel good about the recovery as the market recovers. And in parallel, what we are doing is looking at the specialty part of our Animal Nutrition portfolio to leverage our Human Nutrition, CD&D and go-to-market capabilities to be able to drive increased penetration there. On the pet side, demand creation is going to take a little longer, possibly into the back half of this year and into 2024. But overall, we clearly see signs of recovery, and our forward outlook for Nutrition is still strong and robust in terms of growth. This year, given some of the challenges we faced, we expect it to be similar to last year. Juan, I don't know if you want to add some longer-term perspective.\nJuan Luciano: Listen, Ben, as Vikram said, we continue to be very positive. We look at this -- remember, when we started the Nutrition business, which we're still trying to build into the best nutrition company in the world, we ask our team that we're going to measure them by two factors. One was growing faster than market and in markets where the customers are still moving and innovation is coming, like in Flavors, we've seen that we're growing faster than market, and you can see it by the double-digit growth that we have so far. And then the other thing that we said was EBITDA margin on sales growing, and we grew EBITDA marginal sales in Flavors. So I think that in the others, I think Vikram has -- this industry is going through a difficult destocking year and there has been some self-inflicted things like the integration of this small facility in Pet. So I think we're working through some of our growing pains as we build the portfolio. But I think the important thing is our innovation system, our value proposition to bring new recipes to customers faster than anybody else continues to outperform the industry and that we're seeing in the results. When customers have projects like in beverage and all that, we excel. When customers are flat or destocking, it takes a little longer. We still expect the trajectory to be similar in that regard.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Very good. My second question is on Starches and Sweeteners. You noted similar volumes and margins in the second quarter. You did have a plant that was down unexpectedly. Could you talk about the impact of that that's discrete to the second quarter? And then you point to solid margins for sweetener, starches and flour in the back half of this year, would you expect -- would you characterize that more specifically as similar margins and volumes again? Or do you expect an improvement in the back half of the year? Thank you.\nVikram Luthar: Sure. So Ben, let's talk about the germ crush facility outage. In April, we had an incident at one of our grain elevators at the West plant within ADM's processing complex indicator. This negatively impacted the Carbohydrate Solutions Q2 results by a significant amount. Germ was actually sold into feed markets as our wet mills were slow to reduce the overall exposure to germ, lowering also ethanol production volumes at a time when ethanol margins were strong. We anticipate this to come back in Q4. So yes, Q2 was impacted. I won't get into the specifics but the fact that it was significant enough for us to call it out means it was a meaningful number. But it is going to come back in Q4. So therefore, based on that, you can expect some seasonality, some shift from Q2 to Q4 as a consequence of that. But for the full year, we still remain very -- the outlook for the full year still remains very strong. The sweeteners and starch and actually also the growth of milling volumes have been very resilient. We've seen some softening in the specialty side of the portfolio, but that's been more than offset by mix and margins. So I'd say, overall, the outlook is solid. And yes, we did have a material impact, a significant impact due to the corn germ in Q2.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Thanks and congratulations.\nVikram Luthar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Tom, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTom Palmer: Good morning, and thanks for the question.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning.\nTom Palmer: Perhaps we could just talk through the moving pieces as we migrate to the North America harvest. We've seen crush margins in the U.S. strengthen, especially in the past month or so. Looks like we've seen maybe just a little bit of a beginning in other regions of the world. I think often, when you see our weaker-than-expected supply coming out of the country, other regions of the world often benefit. And at least up to this point, and I know we're ahead of the harvest, we haven't seen that necessarily in margins. I mean, how do you guys think about as we think about the balance of the year, kind of regional expectations for crush progressing?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Tom. As I said before, I think that when you see the world needs more protein and certainly, we can see that given the Argentine GAAP , which is they produce probably 20 million, 25 million tons less soybeans and maybe the world was expecting them to produce, that's reallocating crush, we are locating crush to two places; we are locating crush to Brazil and reallocating crush to U.S. So of course, the time of that is different. And so we see that in the margins that we see for the U.S. coming into Q3 and then Q4. Demand continues to be strong for meal. There won't be so much protein that is not going to just be soybean meal, but there's going to be other types of protein feed, whether it's feed wheat and all that. So when you take that, combined with the increased demand from fuels, but also oils for food consumption. If we expect soybean oil demand to go up like 8%, it's like about 6% coming from food and maybe 2% coming from fuel. But my point is crush margins are supported from everywhere. Of course, as the world gets to try to cover for these soybeans, the margins will be where you are closer to the physical product to have access to the physical soybeans. And that's where ADM footprint and ADM combined with origination and global trade where we excel. So I think the team had a great first half, and they are expecting a great second half. And we don't see anything that can derail this for quite some time. I hope that provides some perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Gupta of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nManav Gupta: Hi. My quick question here is we are in the second phase where a number of new plants on the R&D side will start up in the second half of this year including one of your partners, which is starting up a bigger plant on the West Coast. So I'm just trying to understand from the demand perspective of soyabean oil, do you expect a much stronger demand environment than what we saw in the first half of this year?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I think that we have all these plants that are coming that have been announced. And of course, we're looking all the time at the probability of those plants coming. Sometimes when you build in an industry, not everything comes at the right time. But as you said before, there are two or three large plants coming now in the second half, and that will continue to increase the demand. Of course, our plant in - from our partner comes with our crush capacity as well that we're building, this 1.5 million tons per year. So -- but Manav, when we look at these we believe that, at the end of the day, that demand will come through. At the end of the day, we will have enough crush for soybean oil to participate being maybe 60% of the overall pool of feedstock needed. And we think that the industry will continue to grow, but we continue to need to attract other feedstocks for us to fulfill this potential. So the industry is going to get tight. You're going to need capacity, technology and capabilities, if you will, in order to deliver that, but that's the way you make progress, building a new industry and going through an energy transition. But that's very favorable for ADM. And I think that we're very pleased to bring in Spiritwood on time for the harvest, on budget. So we are very pleased the way the team has managed that implementation.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Adam.\nVikram Luthar: Hi.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi. So I guess my first question, maybe coming back to Nutrition. As I think about the revised outlook for the year, profit now flat. How should we think about the pathway 2024, 2025 and kind of the achievability of the prior 2025 target, I believe, $1.2 billion of OP in that segment? And maybe the split between human and animal within that, clearly animal has been more pressured than Human Nutrition. So just help me think about kind of as we think about the 2023 targets, kind of where you are relative to what was implied in your plans to get to the 2025 goals? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. So when we put the 2025 goals, let me go back on the comments I made before. When we look at our plans, we look at how do we grow faster than market and how do we implement projects and target applications to continue to grow EBITDA margin on sales. The two businesses, Animal Nutrition and Human Nutrition had different profiles and different goals in that regard, so when you see the final number is a combination of all those plans roll out. In the Human Nutrition, margins are much higher and is continue to make it better and more stickier to customers as we develop better solutions. In Animal Nutrition was a margin up story since they were coming from lower margins. So when you think about our numbers are a combination of applying our growing faster than market and our EBITDA margin on sales to a market number. Of course, this industry, as you can see by ourselves and our competitors is having through tough times, whether it is because customers are either not innovating fast enough or destocking at this point in time and making sure they have their supply chains in order. So to the extent that those projections are going to be reduced, our percentages of applied to those numbers will be a smaller number. So we haven't gone through that because, to be honest, we are looking at how do we address our current challenges. So we're not that worried about 2025 right now, we want to make sure we make all the adjustments that we need to make. And maybe as we talk about the adjustment, let me talk about the adjustment, let me talk a little bit about Animal Nutrition. Animal Nutrition, as we become more into the business, if you will. We know there is a commodity part, and there is a specialty part. The specialty part matches very well with the -- what the playbook that we have in the human side. And that part is growing and we will continue to accelerate. And Vikram said before, we are repurposing resources to add more of that. There is a commodity part of that, that at the beginning, when we put the two businesses together, we thought it was going to be a good way to open doors, if you will, for the innovation but they have different dynamics. And so we are looking at those different dynamics and how do we need to readjust either the capacities or some of the people associated with that and the intensity of resources in that part as the specialty part is not coming as fast as we thought. So we need to deal with the volatility of the commodity part while the specialty part is a little bit slower. So as those things balance, we are adding productivity to the commodity part of animal, and we are adding more resources to the specialty part in animal and I think that we believe that, that will take us to, again, a growth rate into 2024 for those business. We're going through that. We will cover all that also, Adam in Investor Day as we will have developed more plants. But rest assured, we're very active in our interventions, and we're testing different options in order for us to manage this better. This is also sometimes difficult to characterize on something specific and apply it globally because we have operations in Southeast Asia. We have operations in Brazil. We have operations in Mexico and Europe, in the U.S. And all those things have to be put together and not all the dynamics in all those markets go perfectly aligned and synchronized. So that's why I think we need a little bit more granularity in December to be able to articulate that, which is a little bit more difficult to portray in a call without any numbers or slides.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Andrew, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your view on the Ag Services strength durability. It seems like we've got tighter global grain supplies than we maybe thought we were going to Refined oils premiums that are out record. Crush margins, obviously, in the U.S. that are very strong. I know maybe Argentina comes back next year. But it doesn't feel like these are things that even though you guide for just 2023 things that would end just because of the calendar flips. And so how long do you think the strength in Ag services can continue for? What I guess, maybe are the risks because it seems like the setup should extend. So curious for your perspective there. Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. We have had two great years of crops in Brazil, and we're probably going to have a strong crop in the U.S. Volumes are good for us. So we like when there are volumes. But of course, the world has become, as you said, more complicated place where is geopolitics and we can see, unfortunately, what is transpiring in the Black Sea or the weather that has become more violent and more volatile. So we go from a very dry La Nina that impacted a lot of locations around the world and then we may go into a more extreme El Nino, and you can see the temperature, record temperatures that we are dealing with right now. So I would say all that volatility and all that uncertainty increases the value of our investments. When we invest more ports in Brazil, we see the leverage that, that has today. Of course, we're going to probably export a little bit less from the U.S. because we're going to export more from Brazil. And that probably is not going to offset each other perfectly. So maybe Ag Services earnings will be down a little bit based on that. But on the other hand, the big availability of crops in the U.S. will help our processing businesses. If you look at the strength in oils, it is because soybean basis are lower as soybean mill bases have strengthened. So, that's where we get the margin expansion. The world also is going into decarbonization, and that's affecting also the grain industry. The grain industry -- and we are leading that with our regeneration program in regen Ag, but more and more people want crops grow in a certain way. And the claims for deforestation limits are also increasing. So I would say you see a future in which maybe less land will be brought into production as we are climbing in the number of people in the world into 10 billion people. But it's not just the number of people. If you think about the protein consumption, the U.S. - in the U.S., we consumed about 270 pounds per year per capita of proteins. China is about 170. The world, on average, is a 100. So if the world was to get to the average of China, we need 70 pounds per person per year. If we were to get to the level of the U.S., you can need 170. That's a huge amount of grain that needs to be produced in not an expanding significant amount of land. So there is a lot that we will have to go through. So you will continue to have, given the weather and the geopolitics, you continue to have pockets of tightness where our footprint in the world, all the plants that we've been blessed with and the ports and the logistic assets and our destination marketing people and our origination marketing people, they will be more valuable into the future, no doubt, as we try to secure food for the global population.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSalvator Tiano: Yes. Thank you very much. On the crush margins, can you provide a little bit more color on why -- in setting aside, of course, Argentina, why Brazil and Europe, the margins have come down recently. And also, now with the crush margin curve having gone up, at least the U.S. substantially, where do you stand in your forward hedging book for the balance of the year? And what's kind of your approach going forward?\nJuan Luciano: Okay. Yes, Salvator. So as you said, crush margins have weakened maybe in recent weeks to maybe $20 to $30 in Europe, especially this is a good transition through all to new crop in the U.S. and global oil basis maybe have weakened a little bit with firmer U.S. oil. We continue to bring biodiesel from there. So that continues to add value to the European businesses. But maybe the protein industry is a little bit weaker in Europe. In Brazil, I think Brazil, if I have to say something, maybe Brazil is trying to figure out how to accommodate all the production of soybean and corn, that they have. So there are a lot of logistics challenges in Brazil. And I think that has made -- has pressure the beans basis country side. And soybean oil, I would say, is pressure in Brazil because of lack of domestic demand. Brazil is one of those places where you have export market, but you also have a domestic market. And I would say right now, domestic market, maybe for soybean oil is a little bit weak. And without the huge benefit that we have with the biofuels policies here in the U.S. and Brazil may be a little bit weaker. But I would say, realistically, those are the two places that will pick up the slack that Argentina or the gap that Argentina left. So those are where the beans are. So we expect high crushing rates for both Brazil and the U.S.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from Steve Haynes of Morgan Stanley. Steve, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSteve Haynes: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe two quick ones on Nutrition. First, are you able to maybe put a dollar amount to the cost savings the various kind of actions you're taking on the animal side of things in regards to kind of what's baked into the 2023 guide. And then secondly, could you just -- maybe just a quick -- a little bit more detail on what some of the inventory losses were on the Pet Solutions? Thank you.\nVikram Luthar: Yes. So on the Animal Nutrition side, yes, we've taken a lot of the actions over the course of latter part of last year as well as ongoing this year. I'm not going to call out specific numbers, but I'll tell you the vast majority of those results should be realized in the back half of the year. So it's going to be obviously analyzed as you think about it. But -- so the full benefit would likely come in 2024. So you should see an uplift as a consequence of those actions coming on a full year basis in 2024, but you'll see a partial benefit clearly in 2023 as well. On the inventory losses related to Pet that we called out, it was, again, some of the acquired inventory as part of the integration of this facility that we had referenced, where we've had some integration challenges with the small business that we acquired in 2021. So it is related to some of that acquired inventory and some contamination that we saw. So that's -- it was it was material enough to Pet solutions. That's the reason we called it out, clearly not material from an overall ADM perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we currently have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Megan Britt for any further remarks.\nMegan Britt: Thank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow-up with me if you have any additional questions. Have a good day, and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Today, ADM reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.6 billion. Combined with first quarter results, this equates to a first half adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 and an adjusted operating profit of $3.4 billion. Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13.8%. The first half of 2023 has probably unfolded as we expected and our financial performance nearly replicates the record results from the first half of last year, even as we face a more challenging macroeconomic and demand environment to start the year. Through active positioning, strong margin management and leveraging our geographically diverse end-to-end supply chain network, we maintain our earnings power and a strong ROIC performance bolstered by key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise. Please turn to Slide 4. Let me highlight just a few across the business. In Ag Services & Oilseeds, our team leveraged past investments in port capabilities to produce record origination volumes out of our Brazilian facilities, expanded our regenerative agriculture partnerships and leverage our ability to flex crush capacity to capitalize on higher canola crush margins. In the latter instance, we flexed more than 300,000 tons of capacity and captured an additional $40 per metric ton of margin. In Carbohydrate Solutions, strategic investments in optimization and modernization allowed our team to manage increased demand for liquid sweeteners, drive growth in BioSolutions revenue and operating profit and produced record results in our milling and international corn businesses. In Nutrition, our unique go-to-market strategy continues to drive a larger sales pipeline and deliver double-digit growth in the Flavors business, thanks to an impressive performance in EMEA and new wins in North America. When you combine all of these aspects across ADM's full business portfolio, it's clear how we are able to convert challenges in one geography, product or business segment into value drivers in another. Next slide, please. Let's review the factors that we see as important drivers for a strong second half finish in 2023. We expect continued strength in Brazil origination for the remainder of the year. Our past strategic investments in port facilities in Brazil optimize origination network and deep connection to our global trade and destination marketing teams will allow us to export strong volumes, capitalizing on the record Brazilian soybean and corn crops. Biofuels demand continues to remain strong. Through the first half of the year, we saw robust margins from biodiesel, strong demand for ethanol and an increasing demand for vegetable oil from renewable green diesel and we expect this trends to continue in the second half. Our Spiritwood, North Dakota processing facilities is scheduled to start up in Q4, adding 1.5 million metric tons of annual soy crush capacity to our portfolio and producing low carbon intensity soybean oil for our JV partner Marathon's nearby renewable diesel facility. Projects like this will support growing demand for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel throughout the industry. We also see continued resilience in food demand for core products. We expect the continued solid margin and volume environment for sweeteners, starches and flours. We are beginning to convert our pipeline of wins in Human Nutrition into operating profit. Well, there are some factors that have hindered growth in the portfolio, we believe positive momentum from Flavors is a predictor of a healthy rebound. We also see continued commodity market dislocations in the second half. ADM has the unique ability to execute with agility in a dynamic environment. Our team utilizes our unparalleled global asset footprint and end-to-end supply chain to adapt to evolving market conditions and meet global food security needs while driving strong returns. Lastly, our balance sheet remains healthy, and we are flexing it toward organic investments and opportunistic share buybacks. We continue to deploy capital to drive organic productivity and innovation-oriented programs such as Spiritwood, Valencia and Marshall as well as invest in our plant automation efforts and our broad decarbonization initiatives. And our $1 billion in share repurchases in the first half highlights our confidence in the strong cash generation and growth potential of our company. As we look at the back half of the year, we intend to continue our share repurchase program. We feel that these factors are fundamental drivers of our strong second half performance. I am proud of how our team has delivered halfway through the year and even more excited about the opportunities presented in the second half and what our team can deliver. Taking collectively, we are raising our earnings expectations for full year 2023. With that, let me turn it over to Vikram, who will go into more detail on the results of operations. Vikram? Thank you, Vikram. As we wrap up today's call, let me highlight a few opportunities that we're excited about as ADM continues to execute our strategic agenda, where we're seeing value generation today and have plans to accelerate. Let's start with digitization and automation. Our ongoing work to modernize and automate our operations is ramping up. Our eight current implementations across North America and Europe are generating millions in run rate benefits. And we have 10 more starting in Q3 with the expectation of similar scalable benefits. Our 1ADM program is accelerating our decision-making and analytics capabilities across the company, helping us find faster path to productivity. With our HR systems now in place globally, our next milestone is bringing part of the Nutrition flavors business on board. In LatAm, we have implemented technology to optimize trade and commercial processes while digitizing freight and logistics contracting. All of this is helping us reduce costs and make better, faster decisions to deliver value to ADM and our customers. Sustainability and decarbonization have opened new avenues for growth across the enterprise while ensuring we are taking the necessary actions on our own footprint. Our STRIVE 35 program continues to deliver important progress, and our recent sustainability report shows our efforts in greenhouse gas emissions, waste reduction, no deforestation and crop traceability achieving targets ahead of plan. As we continue to support our most significant customers with carbon advantage crop sources, we recently announced regenerative Ag program targets of 2 million acres in 2023 with an additional 2 million acres by 2025. With the recent Tallgrass agreement and permit submissions, CO2 from ADM facilities in Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois is now targeted to be captured and stored safely and permanently underground within our expand indicator CCS well capacity. This helps decarbonize our customers' value chains and our own across important opportunity spaces like BioSolutions and sustainable aviation fuel. And we are continuing to invest in the next phase of innovation. Our new Decatur protein solution center is engaged in ADM's world-class science and technology capabilities to deliver on tomorrow's most important consumer nutrition trends. Collaboration between ADM and our ventures partners take us beyond today's alternative protein sources to help address critical areas of sustainability, wellness and affordability. Leveraging our deep fermentation expertise and capacity is positioning us to scale the next generation of food, feed, fuel, fabrics and other industrial products with key partners. The combination of technology alongside global trends in sustainability, food security and well-being is transforming the food and agriculture industry at the fastest pace since the last century. And ADM is at the forefront of this transformation and connected growth opportunities, which give us even more confidence in our long-range growth plans. Thank you for your time today. Vikram and I look forward to your questions. Alex, please open the line. Good morning. Sure, Ben. Yes, of course, first of all, we're very proud of the results we accomplished in the quarter and in the first half. And certainly, we are more confident about the environment ahead of us for ADM. I would say -- let me highlight some of the reasons for that. Certainly, crush margins have started to pick up as we predicted before. They continue to get better. Board crush has been firmer and mill basis has been stronger and BIM basis have dropped in the U.S. as we have anticipated. I think there is a shift in which the world needs more protein, then we need more mill, and we can cover for Argentina shortcomings this year. So that is happening as we predicted. And certainly, it's going to be very good for Q3 and Q4. I think we're seeing these huge crops in Brazil. We see the Brazilian port congestion driving a lower interior basis and allowing us to procure cheaper grains, giving margins to those companies that have invested in the infrastructure to be able to capitalize on that, which we did, both in Santos and in Barcarena in Brazil. So, that's playing very well for us. The last time we talked, ethanol inventories were around 25 million to 26 million barrels. Now we are at the end of June at about 22 million. There is -- we see a strong spot demand for ethanol and corn tough to buy. So that has made margins strengthen, and they are holding. So we are positive about ethanol margins continued in that regard. We continue to see this trend in biofuels and we have a strong book on biodiesel for the quarter. So we feel good about that. We are seeing lower recession challenges and the U.S. consumer very resilient, and that's bringing resiliency in our core products for food demand. And we see that in carb solutions, whether it's sweeteners and starches or whether it's in milling. So as you highlighted, of course, and Vikram went deep into that, the issues in Nutrition, I would say we feel good about how our value proposition continues to resonate in flavors. Flavors is more beverage kind of business, if you will. The innovation happens a little bit faster there. So we see our pipeline continues to grow. That bodes very well for what we know the potential revenue is in 2024. So again, we continue to align the company to these big three trends, food security that with all the geopolitics and the weather makes ADM assets more valuable and gives us more margin in destination marketing services, for example. We see health and well-being, and that continues to show in all the flavors innovation that we're seeing with our customers. And we see the sustainability trend driving all these opportunities in decarbonization. I would say we shouldn't forget when we mentioned this, that either in automation on decarbonization, we are at the early innings of multiyear progress for the industry and for ADM. So I think that we feel very good about '23 and we feel even better about the future. Good morning, Ben. Listen, Ben, as Vikram said, we continue to be very positive. We look at this -- remember, when we started the Nutrition business, which we're still trying to build into the best nutrition company in the world, we ask our team that we're going to measure them by two factors. One was growing faster than market and in markets where the customers are still moving and innovation is coming, like in Flavors, we've seen that we're growing faster than market, and you can see it by the double-digit growth that we have so far. And then the other thing that we said was EBITDA margin on sales growing, and we grew EBITDA marginal sales in Flavors. So I think that in the others, I think Vikram has -- this industry is going through a difficult destocking year and there has been some self-inflicted things like the integration of this small facility in Pet. So I think we're working through some of our growing pains as we build the portfolio. But I think the important thing is our innovation system, our value proposition to bring new recipes to customers faster than anybody else continues to outperform the industry and that we're seeing in the results. When customers have projects like in beverage and all that, we excel. When customers are flat or destocking, it takes a little longer. We still expect the trajectory to be similar in that regard. Good morning. Yes. Thank you, Tom. As I said before, I think that when you see the world needs more protein and certainly, we can see that given the Argentine GAAP , which is they produce probably 20 million, 25 million tons less soybeans and maybe the world was expecting them to produce, that's reallocating crush, we are locating crush to two places; we are locating crush to Brazil and reallocating crush to U.S. So of course, the time of that is different. And so we see that in the margins that we see for the U.S. coming into Q3 and then Q4. Demand continues to be strong for meal. There won't be so much protein that is not going to just be soybean meal, but there's going to be other types of protein feed, whether it's feed wheat and all that. So when you take that, combined with the increased demand from fuels, but also oils for food consumption. If we expect soybean oil demand to go up like 8%, it's like about 6% coming from food and maybe 2% coming from fuel. But my point is crush margins are supported from everywhere. Of course, as the world gets to try to cover for these soybeans, the margins will be where you are closer to the physical product to have access to the physical soybeans. And that's where ADM footprint and ADM combined with origination and global trade where we excel. So I think the team had a great first half, and they are expecting a great second half. And we don't see anything that can derail this for quite some time. I hope that provides some perspective. Yes, I think that we have all these plants that are coming that have been announced. And of course, we're looking all the time at the probability of those plants coming. Sometimes when you build in an industry, not everything comes at the right time. But as you said before, there are two or three large plants coming now in the second half, and that will continue to increase the demand. Of course, our plant in - from our partner comes with our crush capacity as well that we're building, this 1.5 million tons per year. So -- but Manav, when we look at these we believe that, at the end of the day, that demand will come through. At the end of the day, we will have enough crush for soybean oil to participate being maybe 60% of the overall pool of feedstock needed. And we think that the industry will continue to grow, but we continue to need to attract other feedstocks for us to fulfill this potential. So the industry is going to get tight. You're going to need capacity, technology and capabilities, if you will, in order to deliver that, but that's the way you make progress, building a new industry and going through an energy transition. But that's very favorable for ADM. And I think that we're very pleased to bring in Spiritwood on time for the harvest, on budget. So we are very pleased the way the team has managed that implementation. Good morning, Adam. Yes. So when we put the 2025 goals, let me go back on the comments I made before. When we look at our plans, we look at how do we grow faster than market and how do we implement projects and target applications to continue to grow EBITDA margin on sales. The two businesses, Animal Nutrition and Human Nutrition had different profiles and different goals in that regard, so when you see the final number is a combination of all those plans roll out. In the Human Nutrition, margins are much higher and is continue to make it better and more stickier to customers as we develop better solutions. In Animal Nutrition was a margin up story since they were coming from lower margins. So when you think about our numbers are a combination of applying our growing faster than market and our EBITDA margin on sales to a market number. Of course, this industry, as you can see by ourselves and our competitors is having through tough times, whether it is because customers are either not innovating fast enough or destocking at this point in time and making sure they have their supply chains in order. So to the extent that those projections are going to be reduced, our percentages of applied to those numbers will be a smaller number. So we haven't gone through that because, to be honest, we are looking at how do we address our current challenges. So we're not that worried about 2025 right now, we want to make sure we make all the adjustments that we need to make. And maybe as we talk about the adjustment, let me talk about the adjustment, let me talk a little bit about Animal Nutrition. Animal Nutrition, as we become more into the business, if you will. We know there is a commodity part, and there is a specialty part. The specialty part matches very well with the -- what the playbook that we have in the human side. And that part is growing and we will continue to accelerate. And Vikram said before, we are repurposing resources to add more of that. There is a commodity part of that, that at the beginning, when we put the two businesses together, we thought it was going to be a good way to open doors, if you will, for the innovation but they have different dynamics. And so we are looking at those different dynamics and how do we need to readjust either the capacities or some of the people associated with that and the intensity of resources in that part as the specialty part is not coming as fast as we thought. So we need to deal with the volatility of the commodity part while the specialty part is a little bit slower. So as those things balance, we are adding productivity to the commodity part of animal, and we are adding more resources to the specialty part in animal and I think that we believe that, that will take us to, again, a growth rate into 2024 for those business. We're going through that. We will cover all that also, Adam in Investor Day as we will have developed more plants. But rest assured, we're very active in our interventions, and we're testing different options in order for us to manage this better. This is also sometimes difficult to characterize on something specific and apply it globally because we have operations in Southeast Asia. We have operations in Brazil. We have operations in Mexico and Europe, in the U.S. And all those things have to be put together and not all the dynamics in all those markets go perfectly aligned and synchronized. So that's why I think we need a little bit more granularity in December to be able to articulate that, which is a little bit more difficult to portray in a call without any numbers or slides. Yes. Thank you, Andrew. We have had two great years of crops in Brazil, and we're probably going to have a strong crop in the U.S. Volumes are good for us. So we like when there are volumes. But of course, the world has become, as you said, more complicated place where is geopolitics and we can see, unfortunately, what is transpiring in the Black Sea or the weather that has become more violent and more volatile. So we go from a very dry La Nina that impacted a lot of locations around the world and then we may go into a more extreme El Nino, and you can see the temperature, record temperatures that we are dealing with right now. So I would say all that volatility and all that uncertainty increases the value of our investments. When we invest more ports in Brazil, we see the leverage that, that has today. Of course, we're going to probably export a little bit less from the U.S. because we're going to export more from Brazil. And that probably is not going to offset each other perfectly. So maybe Ag Services earnings will be down a little bit based on that. But on the other hand, the big availability of crops in the U.S. will help our processing businesses. If you look at the strength in oils, it is because soybean basis are lower as soybean mill bases have strengthened. So, that's where we get the margin expansion. The world also is going into decarbonization, and that's affecting also the grain industry. The grain industry -- and we are leading that with our regeneration program in regen Ag, but more and more people want crops grow in a certain way. And the claims for deforestation limits are also increasing. So I would say you see a future in which maybe less land will be brought into production as we are climbing in the number of people in the world into 10 billion people. But it's not just the number of people. If you think about the protein consumption, the U.S. - in the U.S., we consumed about 270 pounds per year per capita of proteins. China is about 170. The world, on average, is a 100. So if the world was to get to the average of China, we need 70 pounds per person per year. If we were to get to the level of the U.S., you can need 170. That's a huge amount of grain that needs to be produced in not an expanding significant amount of land. So there is a lot that we will have to go through. So you will continue to have, given the weather and the geopolitics, you continue to have pockets of tightness where our footprint in the world, all the plants that we've been blessed with and the ports and the logistic assets and our destination marketing people and our origination marketing people, they will be more valuable into the future, no doubt, as we try to secure food for the global population. Okay. Yes, Salvator. So as you said, crush margins have weakened maybe in recent weeks to maybe $20 to $30 in Europe, especially this is a good transition through all to new crop in the U.S. and global oil basis maybe have weakened a little bit with firmer U.S. oil. We continue to bring biodiesel from there. So that continues to add value to the European businesses. But maybe the protein industry is a little bit weaker in Europe. In Brazil, I think Brazil, if I have to say something, maybe Brazil is trying to figure out how to accommodate all the production of soybean and corn, that they have. So there are a lot of logistics challenges in Brazil. And I think that has made -- has pressure the beans basis country side. And soybean oil, I would say, is pressure in Brazil because of lack of domestic demand. Brazil is one of those places where you have export market, but you also have a domestic market. And I would say right now, domestic market, maybe for soybean oil is a little bit weak. And without the huge benefit that we have with the biofuels policies here in the U.S. and Brazil may be a little bit weaker. But I would say, realistically, those are the two places that will pick up the slack that Argentina or the gap that Argentina left. So those are where the beans are. So we expect high crushing rates for both Brazil and the U.S."

            "name": "Vikram Luthar",
            "content": "Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 6. The Ag Services & Oilseeds team continues to deliver exceptional results in a dynamic environment, leading to an extremely strong performance in the first half of 2023, surpassing the outstanding first half of the prior year. Q2 results were strong, but slightly below the prior year period. Ag Services results were in line with the strong second quarter of 2022. South American origination results were higher year-over-year as the team delivered record volumes and higher margins on strong export demand, leveraging our strategic investments to expand port capacity to capitalize on the record Brazilian soybean crop. Results for North America origination was slightly lower year-over-year, driven by lower export volumes due to large South America suppliers. Our execution in destination marketing as well as effective risk management continue to deliver strong global trade results, though lower than the record quarter last year. In our crushing subsegment, results were much lower than the record result from the second quarter last year. Global soy crush margins remained strong but were lower year-over-year in all regions due to softer demand for both meal and oil and a tight U.S. soybean carryout. This was partially offset by strong softseed margins and higher volumes supported by a strong Canadian canola crop and use of our flex capacity in EMEA. Additionally, there were approximately $195 million of negative mark-to-market timing effects in the current quarter that are expected to reverse as the contracts execute in future periods. Refined products and other results were significantly higher than the prior year period, achieving a record second quarter. North America results were higher, driven by strong food oil demand and improved biodiesel volumes. In EMEA, strong export demand for biodiesel and domestic food oil demand supported stronger margins. Additionally, there were approximately $90 million of positive mark-to-market timing effects in the current quarter that are expected to reverse as the contracts execute in future periods. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the second quarter of 2022. Looking ahead for the third quarter, we anticipate solid results in Ag Services & Oilseeds. We expect strong demand for grain exports to be heavily weighted towards South America and our Brazilian origination footprint. We anticipate strong volumes and margins for soy and canola crush based on the tight Argentine crop and improving demand outlook for meal and oil. We expect RPO to perform well but have significant reversals of timing impacts from the second quarter, leading to lower net execution margins. Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered strong results in Q2, but lower than the record second quarter of last year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, capitalized on a solid demand environment during the quarter. North America Starches and Sweeteners delivered volumes and margins similar to the prior years, and ethanol margins were solid as industry stocks moderated but lower relative to the prior year. Q2 results were negatively impacted due to unplanned downtime at one of our corn germ plants. In EMEA, the team effectively managed margins to deliver improved results. The global wheat milling business posted higher margins, supported by steady customer demand. BioSolutions continued on its excellent growth trajectory with 22% revenue growth year-over-year. Vantage Corn Processors results were lower due to lower year-over-year ethanol margins. The prior year period also includes a onetime $50 million benefit from the USDA biofuel producer recovery program. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to decarbonize the Carbohydrate Solutions footprint including our definitive agreement with Tallgrass to sequester carbon from our Columbus, Nebraska facility and continued progress on decarbonizing our decade complex through additional carbon capture and sequestration wells, as well as ultra-low-carbon intensity, electricity and steam generation. These are key steps in enabling us to produce low CI feedstocks for use in many applications for our major CPG customers and underpinning our growth opportunities, such as SAS, BioSolutions and our lactic acid polylactic acid joint venture with LG Chem. Looking ahead for the third quarter, we expect continued steady demand in margins for our starches, sweeteners and wheat flour products. Ethanol margins are also expected to remain solid. On Slide 8, Nutrition results were significantly lower than the prior year's record quarter. Human Nutrition results were slightly up year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our Flavors business posted record results in Q2, growing revenues and EBITDA margins due to improved mix and pricing in EMEA, as well as improving demand in North America. Flavors will be a significant growth engine for Human Nutrition for the remainder of the year and will act as a pace setter for the rest of our portfolio. Customer innovation in beverage is beginning to accelerate, and our value proposition is driving our sales pipeline to its largest ever. Growth in Flavors was offset by lower year-over-year results in Specialty Ingredients. While there has been softening of demand for plant-based proteins, particularly for the alternative meat space, other categories like alternative dairy snacks and baked goods as well as specialized nutrition are providing growth opportunities. Although still a small OP contributor, Health and Wellness is seeing demand recovery in probiotics and is benefiting from geographic expansion opportunities offered through ADM's global footprint and customer relationships. Our largest challenge in 2023 has been in the Animal Nutrition business were significantly lower amino acid margins and softer global feed demand has affected volumes driving much lower results. Over the past several months, we have made important adjustments to align the business to this environment, including simplifying our brands and go-to-market strategy, consolidating facilities and optimizing our footprint, rightsizing the workforce in association with these changes and aligning the reporting structure to enhance synergies. We are also refocusing our efforts to increase offerings in the higher-margin specialty feed and ingredients areas. We believe these actions will lead to improved commercial and operational performance, supporting profitable growth when market fundamentals improve. When looking at Nutrition as a whole, we now expect 2023 results to be similar to the prior years, as we expect growth in Human Nutrition to be offset by lower results in Animal Nutrition. However, given the increase in customer innovation we've seen in our Flavors business and our recent wins in pipeline growth across Human Nutrition, as well as the actions we are taking in Animal Nutrition, we remain confident about the future outlook and growth prospects for Nutrition. Slide 9, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher net interest income. Captive insurance improved on premiums from new programs, partially offset by increased claim settlements. In corporate results, net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year, primarily on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs of $262 million was similar versus the prior year as lower health insurance costs were offset by increased global technology spend. Other corporate was unfavorable versus the prior year, primarily due to foreign currency hedges. We still project corporate costs to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was -- of 2023 was approximately 18%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. Through the second quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $2.5 billion. We allocated $600 million to capital expenditures as well as returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to have ample liquidity with nearly $13 billion of cash and available credit, and our leverage ratio are low with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 1.0. Our strong balance sheet and credit ratings provide a stable financial footing for ADM to pursue our strategic growth initiatives while also returning capital to shareholders. We still anticipate $1.3 billion of capital expenditures in 2023. As Juan mentioned, we have already completed the $1 billion of share repurchases that we announced in January this year. We intend to continue our share repurchase program, subject to other strategic uses of capital. Based on our very strong first half, we are raising our full year earnings outlook to around $7 per share with potential for even more upside. Juan? Good morning. Yes, Ben. So I think let's just take a few minutes to talk about why our guide has gone from 10% growth to flat. Animal Nutrition cyclical weakness is persisting for longer than we anticipated. Consumers continue to trade down from higher value, more feed intensive to lower value, less feed intensive proteins. Reformulation to reduce feed cost is also impacting volumes. Plant-based proteins, particularly in the alternative meats continues to be softer than anticipated. The destocking actually is still continuing in that category. And the broader market growth has also moderated, which we had signaled before. Third, the demand fulfillment challenge in pet solutions are taking longer than anticipated resolve. The delay was driven primarily by slower than anticipated integration of the recent small business acquisition that we made in North America. And if you remember, we had COVID, and that delayed also the integration. So we're working through that. But what are we doing? And that's important as you think about the back half as well as the future. Flavors. Strong pipeline and win rates. We talked about the largest ever pipeline we've had. Flavors actually grew profits in the first half 9%, 20% in Q2. So that's a very good sign of the recovery we are seeing in parts of the Human Nutrition business. The other thing that's important to note, Flavors actually contributed almost 50% of the overall operating profit for Nutrition in the first half. So that's an important signal as you think about the future growth of Nutrition. Yes, that was primarily driven in the beverage category, but we see green shoots of opportunity in the food category as well. In the SI side, we are leveraging our CD&D capabilities to accelerate penetration into some of the faster-growing categories. I mentioned alternative spaces, alternative meat has been soft but alternative dairy and some of the other categories actually growing. And we are launching our Decatur protein innovation center in Q3. All that, given our CD&D capabilities allows us to pivot to categories that are growing. And that sometimes takes time. So we anticipate that recovery possibly to come in more in the 2024 time frame, less in the back half of this year. In Animal Nutrition, we are taking actions to improve margins, cost and product and footprint rationalization to improve margins and also to drive profitable growth as the markets recover. So we feel good about the recovery as the market recovers. And in parallel, what we are doing is looking at the specialty part of our Animal Nutrition portfolio to leverage our Human Nutrition, CD&D and go-to-market capabilities to be able to drive increased penetration there. On the pet side, demand creation is going to take a little longer, possibly into the back half of this year and into 2024. But overall, we clearly see signs of recovery, and our forward outlook for Nutrition is still strong and robust in terms of growth. This year, given some of the challenges we faced, we expect it to be similar to last year. Juan, I don't know if you want to add some longer-term perspective. Sure. So Ben, let's talk about the germ crush facility outage. In April, we had an incident at one of our grain elevators at the West plant within ADM's processing complex indicator. This negatively impacted the Carbohydrate Solutions Q2 results by a significant amount. Germ was actually sold into feed markets as our wet mills were slow to reduce the overall exposure to germ, lowering also ethanol production volumes at a time when ethanol margins were strong. We anticipate this to come back in Q4. So yes, Q2 was impacted. I won't get into the specifics but the fact that it was significant enough for us to call it out means it was a meaningful number. But it is going to come back in Q4. So therefore, based on that, you can expect some seasonality, some shift from Q2 to Q4 as a consequence of that. But for the full year, we still remain very -- the outlook for the full year still remains very strong. The sweeteners and starch and actually also the growth of milling volumes have been very resilient. We've seen some softening in the specialty side of the portfolio, but that's been more than offset by mix and margins. So I'd say, overall, the outlook is solid. And yes, we did have a material impact, a significant impact due to the corn germ in Q2. Thank you. Hi. Yes. So on the Animal Nutrition side, yes, we've taken a lot of the actions over the course of latter part of last year as well as ongoing this year. I'm not going to call out specific numbers, but I'll tell you the vast majority of those results should be realized in the back half of the year. So it's going to be obviously analyzed as you think about it. But -- so the full benefit would likely come in 2024. So you should see an uplift as a consequence of those actions coming on a full year basis in 2024, but you'll see a partial benefit clearly in 2023 as well. On the inventory losses related to Pet that we called out, it was, again, some of the acquired inventory as part of the integration of this facility that we had referenced, where we've had some integration challenges with the small business that we acquired in 2021. So it is related to some of that acquired inventory and some contamination that we saw. So that's -- it was it was material enough to Pet solutions. That's the reason we called it out, clearly not material from an overall ADM perspective."

And thanks to all those joining us for the call today. This morning, ADM reported strong first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.09, with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.7 billion and a trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC of 14%. Our performance demonstrates once again the advantage of ADM\u2019s uniquely integrated value chain and broad portfolio. Along with the team\u2019s ability to respond nimbly to opportunities aligned to the three enduring trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. All of this was achieved in a fluid economic environment where ripple effects are being felt from both inflationary and recessionary pressures, shifts in global demand and trade activity and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Our team continues to find ways to rise above these challenges and meet our customers\u2019 needs for consistency, quality and innovation at every turn across our business units. We have wrapped up Q1 with a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows, and we are on track for our 2023 and long-term strategic growth plans and we continue to pursue growth opportunities and increase shareholder returns in alignment with our disciplined capital allocation framework. This quarter, we also announced several exciting milestones in our continued growth and innovation strategy, including the opening of the world\u2019s first probiotic and postbiotics production facility in Valencia, Spain, which increases our global production capacity by a factor of five. Agreements with ADM ventures, partners, BrightFit [ph] and Believer Meats to advance innovations in gut microbiome and cell-based meat respectively. And our definitive agreement with Tallgrass to pave the way for carbon capture from ADM\u2019s Columbus, Nebraska complex furthering our decarbonization agenda. Beyond the financial highlights of the quarter, we are proud to be named one of Fortune\u2019s Most Admired Companies for the 15th year running. And to receive our fourth consecutive Ethisphere award as one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies. It\u2019s an honor to be recognized externally and it continues to demonstrate that ADM\u2019s culture and people are the engine behind our operational and financial success. As we look back on the quarter, I\u2019d like to review it in the context of the 2023 framing we discussed in Q4\u2019s call and provide a few brief updates. Slide 4, please. In January, we reviewed several factors that underpinned our confident outlook for 2023, and these same factors will continue to shape our performance throughout the year. The supply and demand situation remains fundamentally solid with some normalization of supply alongside shift in both the products driving demand and the origins providing supply. Supply and transportation constraints in the Black Sea region, severe drought in Argentina, the record Brazilian crop and a resurgence of demand in China post lockdown have allowed our team to take full advantage of our global footprint. Broad-based food demand remains resilient across key geographies. And we did, we are seeing solid volumes and strong operating margins across vegetable oils, flavors, sweeteners, starches and wheat milling. Demand for biodiesel and renewable green diesel is robust, driving continued strong gross margins. The strong biofuel demand and continued expectation for growth supports our investment in new crush capacity like the additional 150,000 bushels per day from our Spiritwood, North Dakota facility scheduled to come online in time for the 2023 harvest. Nutrition\u2019s growth trajectory for the year remains on course with a double-digit increase in our human nutrition pipeline compared to this point in 2022. As noted, we expect this growth to be significantly weighted to the back half of the year, as we manage through some destocking impacts in beverage, lower margins in amino acids and the broader demand fulfillment challenges we discussed in the last quarter. It\u2019s important to recognize that our team delivered strong Q1 results despite constantly evolving macroeconomic conditions. ADM\u2019s ability to remain agile and apply the principles of productivity and innovation continues to position us well in a dynamic external environment. Let me take a moment to dig deeper into examples of how we are applying our productivity playbook across the organization and how decarbonization is helping us find paths for both innovation and growth. Slide 5, please. From a productivity perspective, we have continued to focus attention on automation within many of our key operations facilities. Automation not only accelerates the modernization of our manufacturing footprint, it is helping us deliver significant savings at the enterprise level. Whether we are reducing chemicals usage, delivering yield improvements or supporting operational reliability, our automation program now has a plan to scale cost improvements across our most critical operational assets over the next several years. Eight of our plans are currently underway and we expect that most of these will complete their automation implementation by year-end. And we are seeing operational and financial impacts immediately following implementation. Our most recent implementation in SEDA Rapeseed [ph] is already generating millions of dollars in efficiencies in just the first few months, confirming the double-digit returns we expect to see from these proceeds. As a whole, the impact on operating profit is significant with a target run rate of approximately $200 million per year when implementations are complete at more than 70 facilities over the next seven years. This is only one example of productivity measures we are undertaking to ensure ADM maintains agility given the levels of uncertainty in the external environment. Each of our businesses and functions is identifying opportunities to drive efficiency at the scale, while maintaining a focus on growth. Our decarbonization journey continues to move at a rapid pace and is allowing us to showcase innovation in action. Our advantaged position in alternative fuels production has prepared us for the demand cycle that continues to rise across biodiesel and renewable diesel. We continue to explore strategic options to convert ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel. The multibillion dollar addressable opportunity represented by SAF alone highlights the criticality of access to low-carbon feedstocks at a scale exponentially higher than what is available today. This is why we are prioritizing the decarbonization of our Decatur complex as the first critical step in unlocking significant value. Last year, we announced one of the world\u2019s first, ultra-low emissions power plants would be built adjacent to our Decatur processing complex, supplying ADM with low emissions steam and electricity. This leverages our world-class facility that has been successfully sequestered in CO2 for more than a decade. ADM is a pioneering carbon capture and sequestration, and we are extending that expertise with a plan to triple the number of CCS wells in the Decatur area and sequester up to seven million metric tons of CO2 per year. This positions ADM as a clear leader in the ability to supply customers with low-carbon feedstocks and accelerate the decarbonization of their own value chain. And we think this is just the beginning. I\u2019ll speak more about how we are defining that next phase as we wrap up. Now I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?\nVikram Luthar: Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 6. The Ag Services & Oilseeds team had an outstanding start to 2023, with significantly higher year-over-year results in Q1. Ag Services results were much higher than the first quarter of 2022. In South American origination, excellent risk management and higher export demand due to the record Brazilian soybean crop drove significantly higher year-over-year results. In North America, origination results were also higher, driven by stronger soybean exports. In global trade, solid margins and efficient execution led to strong results. Crushing results were in line with the first quarter last year. In North America, the team executed well, capitalizing on historically strong soybean and softseed crush margins that were supported by robust demand for renewable fuels. In EMEA, crush margins were lower year-over-year as trade flows adjusted from the dislocations caused last year by the war in Ukraine. Additionally, there were approximately $240 million of positive timing effects during the quarter, which included both expected reversals of prior timing losses as we executed the business as well as a positive impact of about $100 million pulled forward from future periods as crush margins declined at the end of the quarter. Refined products and other results were substantially higher than the prior year period. North America biodiesel results were higher with record volumes and strong margins, supported by favorable blend economics and tight diesel stocks. In EMEA, domestic demand for food, oil and export demand for biodiesel drove strong margins. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the first quarter of 2022. Looking ahead for the second quarter, we expect RPO to continue its strong performance. Crushing is expected to be strong, but lower than the prior year based on current crush margins. We do not expect last year\u2019s significant volatility that impacted energy and grain trade flows to reoccur in Ag Services. Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered solid results in Q1, though lower than the very strong first quarter of the prior year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment capitalized on solid demand in the quarter. North America Starches and Sweeteners delivered strong volumes and margins. Ethanol margins, pressured by high industry stock levels, were down relative to the same quarter last year. In EMEA, the team effectively managed margins in a dynamic operating environment to deliver improved results. The global wheat milling business posted much higher margins driven by robust customer demand. BioSolutions continued on its strong growth trajectory with revenues increasing by over 20% year-over-year. Vantage Corn Processors\u2019 results were significantly lower due to weaker ethanol margins. Looking ahead, for the second quarter, we expect resilient demand and strong margins for our Starches and Sweeteners products. Ethanol margins, while improving, are expected to remain below last year. Of note, we also recognized a $50 million benefit from a biofuel producer tax credit in the prior year quarter that will not repeat. On Slide 8, Nutrition results were significantly lower year-over-year versus the record prior year quarter. Human Nutrition results were in line with the first quarter of 2022 as the business continued to manage demand fulfillment challenges and destocking in certain categories. Flavors results were slightly lower than the prior year as strong results in EMEA were offset by lower results in North America. Specialty Ingredients results were higher year-over-year, driven by healthy margins. Health and Wellness was lower year-over-year. In Animal Nutrition, results were significantly lower compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to much lower margins in amino acids. The Animal Nutrition business, excluding PET, is expected to face challenging demand conditions over the course of the year, and we are taking actions to mitigate the impact. These actions include targeted cost reductions, refining our go-to-market strategy with a more customer-centric approach, optimizing our production footprint, particularly in EMEA and refocusing resources on our strongest growth categories. Looking ahead for the second quarter, we expect year-over-year profit growth at Human Nutrition, while Animal Nutrition will still be lapping the higher amino acid margins from the prior year. For the full year, we expect to achieve 10% plus constant currency operating profit growth in Nutrition, led by Human Nutrition. And with continued recovery in demand fulfillment and reduced destocking effects, we remain optimistic about our Human Nutrition sales pipeline and growth opportunities. As we noted before, operating profit growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Slide 9, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher interest income. Captive insurance results were in line with the prior year. In Corporate, unallocated corporate costs of $248 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to higher financing and centers of excellence costs. Other corporate was unfavorable versus the prior year due to the absence of an ADM Ventures, investment revaluation gain, partially offset by higher contribution from foreign currency hedges. We still project corporate costs to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year. Net interest expense for the quarter increased $27 million year-over-year due primarily to higher short-term interest rates. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was approximately 16%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. In the first quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $1.3 billion. We allocated $325 million to capital expenditures as well as returned $600 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to have ample liquidity with nearly $10 billion of cash and available credit. And our adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.2 is well below our 2.5x threshold. Our strong balance sheet and single A credit rating provide a stable financial footing for ADM to pursue our strategic growth initiatives, while also returning capital to shareholders. In 2023, we still anticipate $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and $1 billion of opportunistic buybacks subject to other strategic uses of capital. Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Vikram. Before we wrap up today, I wanted to share some insights into how we're thinking about the remainder of 2023 and how we are positioning the company to take on the next phase of opportunities. We are confident that ADM will be able to deliver on our plans for 2023 despite some pockets of soft demand. Supply and demand shift are allowing ADM to flex our integrated value chain, in support of another strong year of results. We continue to advance partnership agreements with major players across multiple industries from regenerative agriculture to alternative proteins, to sustainable fuels, to plant-based industrial and personal care products. All of these partnerships are supporting ADM as we evolve at pace with the external environment to capture new growth opportunities. We see accelerated upsides emerging from product areas like biosolutions expected to grow at double-digit rates again this year. We have significant production capacity coming online within the year across our three businesses to support continued demand growth. And we're driving forward the broad-based decarbonization agenda in our Decatur complex, which is unlocking both near-term and long-range value for our customers across multiple industries. With a combination of solid business performance in the core business, along with the strong growth opportunities across our value chain, we expect that we will be able to deliver between $6 to $7 in earnings per share in 2023 and based on the strength of our balance sheet and cash position, we continue to pursue opportunities to deliver both near-term value to shareholders while positioning ADM for its next phase of growth. We're anticipating an in-depth review of the opportunities we see and the path ahead with the investment community in the fourth quarter. We'll share more details on this event in the coming months. Thank you for your time today, Vikram and I look forward to answering any questions you may have. With that, Bailey, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Tom Palmer from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, Tom. Your line is now open.\nTom Palmer: Good morning and thank you for the question.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Tom.\nTom Palmer: Wanted to ask on \u2013 maybe ask how you're thinking about earnings cadence this year, in the crushing sub-segment. So your earnings presentation notes, soybean crush margins have dipped lately in several regions of the world, but we also can see, right, the U.S. features curve points to stronger margins in the second half of the year. So maybe just, should we be looking at the second quarter coming in below the first quarter and then a potential bounce for the second half of the year or is the second quarter perhaps looking a bit better for you than industry curves might suggest?\nJuan Luciano: I think you're right in your assessment that maybe second quarter will come a little bit lower and then right, crush margins will raise for the second part of the year. In the coming quarter, crush is expected to remain strong, but lower than the prior year period, as you said, based on covering crush margins as well as impact from mark-to-market that pull profits into Q1. Remember those $100 million that Vikram mentioned before. So margins will remain solid, but again, lower probably than the prior year while canola crush margins look to be improved in the upside. If you think about the whole year, crush is position for another extremely strong year in 2023, the fundamentals of the business remain strong and the structural changes are driving increased demand for both vegetable oil and meal. In 2022, remember, Tom, we have significant dislocations around the world. Likewise, 2023 will be influenced by any new dislocations which may or may not happen. Remember that while Argentina and South America is crushing hard now, Argentina will probably run out of beans given their small crop, later in the year. And at that point in time, certainly the market will have to cover for that lack of meal being exported from Argentina. We think that's where the U.S. crush margins will pick up, and that's what the curves are showing. So I think with record world soybean production, we expect soybean meal will gain in the inclusions in global \u2013 Russians and we are going to have also on our own side, we're going to have a Spiritwood coming in at the end of Q3. And also we are going to have Paraguay coming back online at that point and Ukraine also. So when you think about this operational improvements and higher refining volumes and strong refining margins we are due for a very, very strong year in ag services and oilseeds in 2023. Bailey, any other questions?\nOperator: Hi. Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi. I was hoping to talk a little bit more on nutrition and maybe get a little bit more color on kind of the confidence of the recovery and profits as you see it through the year. Sounds like that's pretty heavily skewed towards the human side and I guess, I'm just trying to make sure I understand kind of how much of that is a function of the comps getting easy and flapping some of the price costs and supply chain challenges late last year. Actual market growth beneficial from some of the new capacity and the volume that you can bring to bear and then as well help us think about on the animal side, kind of the growth in pet versus the pressures you're seeing on amino acids and some of the legacy in your businesses?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, Adam. So this is no different from what we signaled in the Q4 call. We had clearly indicated that the first half nutrition is going to be weak and the strength is going to come in the second half. So let's break it down. In human nutrition, as we mentioned, we've got a strong pipeline and actually customers are looking for more and more innovation, and that plays to our strengths, given our broad capabilities and our suite of ingredients. So we see a very robust pipeline, double-digit increase in pipeline and increasing win rates. So that's point number one. Point number two is that destocking effects should neutralize, we expect inventory levels to come back to regular levels. And then the third is also you relate the demand fulfillment challenges, which we experienced mainly in the back half of last year. We are working through that. We need to expect most of these issues to be resolved in the second half of this year. So a combination of a very strong pipeline, less destocking, as well as less demand fulfillment challenges gives us confidence for back half loaded growth and human nutrition. We'll still have growth in the second quarter. We expect maybe mid single-digit growth in the second quarter. So you can see the progress roughly flat in Q1, mid single-digit growth in Q2, and the back half should be significantly higher versus the back half of last year, which was challenged by demand fulfillment. Then on animal nutrition on the pet side, we still have double-digit growth in pipeline, so we see that category continue to be strong if you remember, we signal demand fulfillment challenges also in pet. We expect also that to be addressed over the course of this year, mainly in the second half, we are expecting some new capacity also to come online in the second half for pet. So we feel pretty good about pet. On the animal nutrition side, that's been challenged because we had significant contribution from amino acids in Q1, Q2, and also Q3 of last year. So we are lapping those margins, so it's going to take time and that's why it's going to be back half loaded. We also see weakness generally in feed demand as feed customers are looking at reformulation and consumers are going from higher value protein to lower value protein, but we are taking actions while volume is anticipated, be flat to slightly lower. We are working to improve margins by very, very targeted cost actions and as well as go-to-market actions that I referenced. So we feel good about the back half on animal nutrition from a turnaround perspective. So that's the reason why nutrition is shaping up to be a second half story for the reasons I cited, but we feel strong and good about the 10% plus constant currency OP growth in nutrition for 2023.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead, Ben. Your line is now open.\nBen Theurer: Perfect. Thank you very much and Vikram and Juan, congrats on the results.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ben.\nBen Theurer: So my questions just coming back a little bit to the ag service and oilseeds business, and I wanted to dig in a little more detail if you could share your outlook as it relates to the service piece of the equation, which obviously has been a very strong performer and we continue to see like the global disruption, but you're seeing some signs of improvements. I just want to understand how you feel about the renewal of the Russia, Ukraine grain deal but also in context with everything that's shaping up in the world, the demand versus the supply side, and where you see buckets of opportunity, maybe some market share gains and what are the risks particularly to your current outlook. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, thank you, Ben. A full question there. So listen, ag service has delivered another very, very strong quarter this year. It was strong in South America, it was strong in North America. It was strong at the global trade through all our destination marketing facilities. So when you look at the Q2, of course, in Q1 we were able to export a little bit more than maybe Brazil couldn't do it because of some of the rains and the delays. We think that in Q2 and Brazil will probably take over being the large crop that they have and the cheapest origin. Destination marketing was still holding margins there. It is an important activity around the world. You describe the risks associated. When we think about the year, the year hinges a lot in the recovery of demand in China lockdowns, the ups and downs of the crops around the world. We still have to deal with an Argentine disaster in terms of crops, and with the Brazil that has very strong crop. That is creating changes in the trade flows. So all of a sudden, we are sending beans from the U.S. to Europe to transform into biodiesel and bringing the biodiesel back, but also Brazil is sending beans to Argentina; Brazil, maybe sending a little bit of both or beans here. So there is a lot of changes in that, and that's ADM normally takes advantage of our huge footprint and normally our footprint and our ability to execute on those trade flows become an advantage. So you're going to see that in ag services around the year. I said there are two pivoting things this year. One is, again China demand coming out of lockdown. The second is the ability of Ukraine to continue to export as we have been doing during since August last year. Of course, the corridor has been renewed as ADM, we will always do our best to make sure that that continuous and export source for the Ukrainians, remember that that part of the world owns 25% of all the black rich soil in the world. So it's a very important condition \u2013 very important production area. So the corridor has been renewed, but of course, there are differences between Ukrainians view and Russian views at this point in time. And unfortunately, we have seen over the last week at the inspection of vessels being reduced to maybe a few days per week. So we remain hopeful and we remain ready to help to do this. I think that what we need to think fundamentally, the corridor is all about the availability of bringing that production. What I worry or the accessibility better said, what I worry is about the availability of the crop. This prolonged conflict is hurting the Ukrainian farmers and is hurting the Russian farmers. Both are dealing with issues, and I think that the expectation should be the conflict not resolved for production out of this area to come lower over the coming years, regardless of the export corridor. So I think, again, short-term and accessibility issue, long-term or medium-term, I worry more about availability and creating the pockets of tension again.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Andrew, please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on the refined products segment, which came in much, much stronger than we anticipated. And when I look at the dynamics that you called out on biodiesel and some of the other things, it seems like a lot of those are still very much in place. Is it possible that that is a more sustainable, I guess not run rate, but more achievable again in the second quarter? Are there things that have changed that would prevent that from happening?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, Andrew. I think we feel pretty good or that we will execute very well in this segment and probably exceed last year's performance. We have good visibility given the book that we have. So demand continues to be there strong and we continue to execute well. We see the margins and they continue to be there with us. So there has been some comments about maybe a slower ramp up of some facilities. It's very difficult to predict, the ramp up of specific facilities, but when you look at all the data, you see all that material coming, soybean oil will continue to be a key feedstock for this. It's impossible to develop all this industry without the participation of soybean oil. Now we have a path for canola oil to get to that source. U.S. biodiesel production was up 8% in Q1. Renewable diesel production was up like 61% versus the previous year. We continue to flex our system to be able to bring biodiesel from Europe to benefit the U.S. industry. And as I said before, we expect a year that will be better than last year. And given the affordable book that we have, we have visibility into that. So we feel very confident about this, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead, Ben. Your line is now open.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey, thank you so much for taking the question. Good morning, everybody.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Ben,\nBen Bienvenu: I want to ask about the starches and sweeteners business. You called out strong core results, good volumes and good margins. Obviously the segment was weighed on by weaker ethanol results. Could you talk a little bit about the overall backdrop that you're seeing through the balance of the year and would operating profit have been up in the first quarter, excluding the headwinds from ethanol?\nVikram Luthar: Well, so on starches and sweeteners, you're right. Let's break it down. The liquid sweetener part of the portfolio, we see resilient demand and strong margins given the good contracting we had last year, and we also see increased volumes from Mexico, which helps the business. The other thing that should help over the course of the year is higher sugar prices. While, you know, we don't have a lot of spot business, but to the extent we do that should be supportive of margins and the liquid sweetener side of the portfolio. The specialty side, we are seeing strong margins, but some softness in the volumes. That's also part of sweeteners and starches. In the biosolutions, when you think about the mix of the portfolio, we are moving more and more towards the BioSolutions business. And that had very strong performance consistently over the last few years and again in Q1 with 20-plus percent growth in revenue and anticipated to continue at that clip for the course of this year. So at a high level Sweeteners and Starches, good volumes and robust margins, so it should give us confidence that we'll have a very good year again in 2023. Now with respect to ethanol, that remains the most volatile part of our portfolio, Q1 was soft. We think Q2 is going to be a little better, although lower than Q2 of last year. We had the biofuel tax credit, which we referenced, which will not repeat. But we also see some green shoots on the ethanol side. We are more constructive about the outlook of ethanol for the rest of the year. Why, for a few reasons. One is, we see ethanol stock levels coming off their peaks from earlier in Q1. Two, we continue to see good export demand. Think about what's happening even in Japan and India. So our export demand should be in the 1.2 billion, 1.4 billion gallons, which is consistent with what we saw last year. We also see higher blending rates. I think blend rates have trended slightly up. Gasoline demand continues to be strong given the strong blend economics. So in short, while we think ethanol will likely be low from an absolute margin perspective versus last year, we're still constructive generally for the rest of the year. So overall, we see a pretty strong year for Carbohydrate Solutions business.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Eric Larson from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nEric Larson: Yes. Good morning everybody, and congratulations on a good quarter.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Eric. Good morning.\nEric Larson: So this probably comes \u2013 I can't remember the last time I actually asked an ethanol question, but my \u2013 one of my questions today is on ethanol. So the outlook going into 2024, actually looks better because we now have \u2013 we now have a year potentially, hopefully, year-end or year-round E15 blending, which I know it's a disappointment, it's in 2024, not '20 \u2013 starting in 2023, but that could consume another 1.5 billion or 2 billion bushels of corn. So the outlook for ethanol, this year I appreciate Vikram's comments. But wouldn't you expect maybe that your demand would be better starting in 2024? And now you'll have some confidence that the retailers can put infrastructure in and put the pumps in for E15. So is that too optimistic on my part?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, Eric, let me take you a little bit higher because the gyrations of ethanol up and down sometimes get confused, but we invest for the long-term here. So fundamentally if you think about the last IPCC [ph] report, it strongly argue that it's going to be difficult for humanity to stay in the 1.5 degree hitting that we should try to achieve based on the Paris agreement. If you think about that, then adaptation is what all companies and all governments are thinking about. Biofuels and bioproducts like biomaterials or biosolutions are a key part of that adaptation. So whether it's ethanol \u2013 whether it's ethanol getting in a pathway to SAF, whether it's renewable green diesel, whether it is biodiesel that's going to be a big part of the future. And ADM's strong position in that and competitive advantage will shine through. We see the same thing as we position ourselves for biosolutions or biomaterials. Again, this is just \u2013 you're going to see governments, you're going to see companies, you're going to see everybody having to work together to achieve this energy transition, if you will, and to be able to keep climate change to a level that is manageable. But you have to think biofuels will be an important part of the future. U.S. will be a key player in biofuel and ADM will be absolutely in a strong position to deliver on that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Please go ahead, Manav. Your line is now open.\nManav Gupta: Quick question guys. Help us understand just a little bit what caused the crush margins to come in so sharply. We entered this year thinking a lot of new RD capacity will start up and soybean prices will actually move up. They've actually moved down. Was it like too much prebuying happening in 4Q? What caused this pullback in soybean oil prices? And then vegetables, so as we look at the vegetable oil prices, refined product prices are still at a significant premium to unrefined which technically benefits you a lot. So your outlook for the spread between refined and refined vegetable oils? Thank you.\nVikram Luthar: Yes. So on the crush margins, as Juan noted, clearly, as you can also see in the curve right now, Q2 looks soft. And the reason is because of the expectation of a certain delay in renewable green diesel capacity. Just to be clear, we remain confident that renewable green diesel capacity is going to increase by about 1 billion gallons in 2023. The time line has just been pushed back to the second half of this year. So therefore, you see a little bit of softness in the nearby as a consequence of that. The other aspect is also related to what's happening in Argentina. In Argentina, there given \u2013 there's more beans given what's happened with the soy dollar for at least part of Q2, there's more crush capacity, if you may, that's coming online, and that's also helping reduce a little bit of the nearby crush. What's going to happen in Argentina by May or June time frame, they're going to run out of beans. So that export is not going to be available. So that should be supportive of crush margins beyond Q2. And that's why you see the slight inverse in the curve in the nearby and then recovering in the back half of the year. So that's really all that happened. It was transitory, nothing that is more than that is the delay in renewable green diesel capacity as well as what's happening in Argentina \u2013 in Argentina.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Steven Haynes from Morgan Stanley. Steven, please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteven Haynes: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the carbon capture discussion earlier in the call and the plans to kind of triple the well capacity. Do you know kind of a time line for when that might be completed? And how much capital you're going to be putting behind that initiative?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. So at the moment, we operate one well, we're going to activate the second well and then bring five new wells. Each well from a capital perspective is not a big burden. It's something about $15 million to $20 million per well depending on the cost of metals and all that. So we probably are in the high end of $20 million in the low end or something like $12 million to $15 million. The time line every time we need to have a well finished is about three months. So it's relatively quickly. The issue is you need to go through regulatory approvals and that's where we are working where government affairs team is working heavily with dedicator area and with some of the farmers in the area. So again, it could happen relatively quickly, probably within the next couple of years, if you will, not a big burden from a capital perspective, but will significantly increase our ability to pump CO2 underground. As I said, if today we have about 1 million tons, give or take per year, this will take us to 7 million, and it will be a significant boost to the decarbonization of Decatur and Decatur becoming through supplier of low-carbon intensity feedstocks for many industries.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Ben Kallo from Baird. Please go ahead, Ben. Your line is now open.\nBen Kallo: Hey. Thank you, guys for taking my question. Maybe could we touch just going back to renewable diesel and crush capacity coming online? Could you just remind us about the North Dakota Facility? And if there's offtakes there or if we potentially get to a position when it comes online for the 2023 harvest where you're going to have excess crush capacity out there with others coming online and if there's further delays? And then maybe could you touch on just RVO and any kind of expectations around timing there and thoughts around if anything would be revised? Thank you guys.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ben. Thank you for the question. Yes, as you said, coming along with the development of the industry, ADM wants to be pressed bringing crush capacity. We're doing that, as you know in a partnership with an oil company. So they have the ability to move that product to make it into the fuel market. We have the responsibility to move, of course, the meal for which we've been working on. The plant is coming thankfully on time and on schedule to be with us by the harvest. So about the Q3, as I said in my remarks, the 150,000 tons bushels per day of crush capacity. We look at the industry. I always mentioned or I mentioned before that we look at this plant and project for two years to make sure that capacity was coming on stream prudently. We see now the industry. We see all the capacity that is coming, is all needed to be able to supply this I think the renewal diesel industry is still going to have an issue how to get feedstock for that. So that will be the issue for a while. I think that will make meal \u2013 U.S. meal very competitive in the world markets and the U.S. is planning to take share, we are part of that plan as well. So we feel comfortable about the cadence at which the plants are coming. Maybe some of our renewable diesel plants are coming a little bit slower than expected. Every project has its issues. Thankfully, ours is not delayed. But if others are, I think it's going to facilitate a little bit the digestion of all this capacity that is coming because we need to get the fit for that. I think Vikram will cover the second part of your question on RVOs.\nVikram Luthar: Yes. As you know, Ben, in December the RVO proposal that came out was largely constructive for the biofuels industry and we appreciated the multiyear proposal as well as the strong support for conventional ethanol. We, however, did note in our testimony and written comments to the EPA, the opportunity for improvement in the advanced category of biomass-based diesel. And it's important to note that does not, in any way change our assessment of the strong renewable diesel capacity growth this year and beyond. And this is going to come out in June. We expect that the EPA is going to consider the feedback they've got from the industry, and we are constructive about what that outlook is going to look like. But nevertheless, we are confident about the growth of the renewable diesel capacity and the ongoing benefit and impact for crush margins going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Your final question today comes from the line of Salvator Tiano from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Salvator. Your line is now open.\nSalvator Tiano: Yes. Thank you very much. I want to go back to the Ag Service segment and understand a couple of things. So firstly, when I go back to the transcript last quarter, your initial expectations were for earnings to be down versus last year, if I remember correctly. And instead, they were up 35%. So, you mentioned a lot of dislocations but I just want to understand what actually differed versus your January expectations firstly for Q1? And secondly, you made the comment that Q2 earnings for Ag Services will be lower year-on-year. And I think that's pretty much what everybody expected given the situation with Ukraine last year. I just want to frame a little bit with regard to Q1 where you may $350 million profit. How do you expect Q2 Ag Services to be versus Q1? And especially given that Brazil is still selling \u2013 farmers have still sold far less soybeans than last year. Does this mean that you can see a very big boost in Q2 from these \u2013 from these trade flows? Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Salvator, for the question. So as you said, Ag Services has a very, very good first quarter. This team continues to deliver and outperform sometimes on our own expectations. If you think about global trade and all the issues around the world sometimes are difficult to estimate, if you will but our team with their ability to connect, if you will origins with destinations and especially with the investments that we have made over the years on destination markets and allow us to capture more volume at higher margins than maybe in the past. They have had also a very disciplined risk management and very effective one, which we expect from them, but sometimes it's not that easy to deliver in this volatile world. Great execution in Australia, great execution on the Black Sea, origination program and again a solid margins at destination. South America were probably another bright point for us. They capture higher volumes and margins. We were very well positioned on a crop that was very large and on a farmer that was undersold. So we position ourselves properly, and we get the rewards from that. And North America benefited from a strong risk management and a strong bean export programs. Again, Brazil was a little bit delay with some of the rains and all that in terms of their harvest. So the U.S. extended the window a little bit more. Now Brazil, we think \u2013 if you think about second quarter and what we're predicting it to be a little bit lower is we're not going to have \u2013 if you think about second quarter last year, the same volatility that we have because of Ukraine at that point in time. And the world was starting and the world was a little bit stunned on what we do now. Now we know what do we do? We have channels to export; the product is flowing for the most part. As I warned in my previous question, I think we're more worried about the productivity of the farmers of Ukraine and Russia eventually later on. But I think for this year, we have the ability to export that. We expect robust North American corn exports until Brazil second con crop is available. And then I think that North America will lap until Brazil run out of core. So we have lower North American soy exports expected in the second quarter because Brazil will take that place. So it's a little bit the shift if you will. And the decrease of that shift to be honest, Salvator sometimes are marked by the logistics issues. Brazil has a large corn crop and soybean crop, and it needs to be able to move that to the ports and being able to ship it. And then you have the Ukraine issue we discussed before. So those are the puts and takes. In general, as I said, the unit is performing very well, performed exceptionally well in the first quarter. We expect them to perform stronger in the second quarter, but maybe not as strong as second quarter last year. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session.

            "content": "Thank you, Megan. And thanks to all those joining us for the call today. This morning, ADM reported strong first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.09, with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.7 billion and a trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC of 14%. Our performance demonstrates once again the advantage of ADM's uniquely integrated value chain and broad portfolio. Along with the team's ability to respond nimbly to opportunities aligned to the three enduring trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. All of this was achieved in a fluid economic environment where ripple effects are being felt from both inflationary and recessionary pressures, shifts in global demand and trade activity and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Our team continues to find ways to rise above these challenges and meet our customers' needs for consistency, quality and innovation at every turn across our business units. We have wrapped up Q1 with a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows, and we are on track for our 2023 and long-term strategic growth plans and we continue to pursue growth opportunities and increase shareholder returns in alignment with our disciplined capital allocation framework. This quarter, we also announced several exciting milestones in our continued growth and innovation strategy, including the opening of the world's first probiotic and postbiotics production facility in Valencia, Spain, which increases our global production capacity by a factor of five. Agreements with ADM ventures, partners, BrightFit [ph] and Believer Meats to advance innovations in gut microbiome and cell-based meat respectively. And our definitive agreement with Tallgrass to pave the way for carbon capture from ADM's Columbus, Nebraska complex furthering our decarbonization agenda. Beyond the financial highlights of the quarter, we are proud to be named one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies for the 15th year running. And to receive our fourth consecutive Ethisphere award as one of the world's most ethical companies. It's an honor to be recognized externally and it continues to demonstrate that ADM's culture and people are the engine behind our operational and financial success. As we look back on the quarter, I'd like to review it in the context of the 2023 framing we discussed in Q4's call and provide a few brief updates. Slide 4, please. In January, we reviewed several factors that underpinned our confident outlook for 2023, and these same factors will continue to shape our performance throughout the year. The supply and demand situation remains fundamentally solid with some normalization of supply alongside shift in both the products driving demand and the origins providing supply. Supply and transportation constraints in the Black Sea region, severe drought in Argentina, the record Brazilian crop and a resurgence of demand in China post lockdown have allowed our team to take full advantage of our global footprint. Broad-based food demand remains resilient across key geographies. And we did, we are seeing solid volumes and strong operating margins across vegetable oils, flavors, sweeteners, starches and wheat milling. Demand for biodiesel and renewable green diesel is robust, driving continued strong gross margins. The strong biofuel demand and continued expectation for growth supports our investment in new crush capacity like the additional 150,000 bushels per day from our Spiritwood, North Dakota facility scheduled to come online in time for the 2023 harvest. Nutrition's growth trajectory for the year remains on course with a double-digit increase in our human nutrition pipeline compared to this point in 2022. As noted, we expect this growth to be significantly weighted to the back half of the year, as we manage through some destocking impacts in beverage, lower margins in amino acids and the broader demand fulfillment challenges we discussed in the last quarter. It's important to recognize that our team delivered strong Q1 results despite constantly evolving macroeconomic conditions. ADM's ability to remain agile and apply the principles of productivity and innovation continues to position us well in a dynamic external environment. Let me take a moment to dig deeper into examples of how we are applying our productivity playbook across the organization and how decarbonization is helping us find paths for both innovation and growth. Slide 5, please. From a productivity perspective, we have continued to focus attention on automation within many of our key operations facilities. Automation not only accelerates the modernization of our manufacturing footprint, it is helping us deliver significant savings at the enterprise level. Whether we are reducing chemicals usage, delivering yield improvements or supporting operational reliability, our automation program now has a plan to scale cost improvements across our most critical operational assets over the next several years. Eight of our plans are currently underway and we expect that most of these will complete their automation implementation by year-end. And we are seeing operational and financial impacts immediately following implementation. Our most recent implementation in SEDA Rapeseed [ph] is already generating millions of dollars in efficiencies in just the first few months, confirming the double-digit returns we expect to see from these proceeds. As a whole, the impact on operating profit is significant with a target run rate of approximately $200 million per year when implementations are complete at more than 70 facilities over the next seven years. This is only one example of productivity measures we are undertaking to ensure ADM maintains agility given the levels of uncertainty in the external environment. Each of our businesses and functions is identifying opportunities to drive efficiency at the scale, while maintaining a focus on growth. Our decarbonization journey continues to move at a rapid pace and is allowing us to showcase innovation in action. Our advantaged position in alternative fuels production has prepared us for the demand cycle that continues to rise across biodiesel and renewable diesel. We continue to explore strategic options to convert ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel. The multibillion dollar addressable opportunity represented by SAF alone highlights the criticality of access to low-carbon feedstocks at a scale exponentially higher than what is available today. This is why we are prioritizing the decarbonization of our Decatur complex as the first critical step in unlocking significant value. Last year, we announced one of the world's first, ultra-low emissions power plants would be built adjacent to our Decatur processing complex, supplying ADM with low emissions steam and electricity. This leverages our world-class facility that has been successfully sequestered in CO2 for more than a decade. ADM is a pioneering carbon capture and sequestration, and we are extending that expertise with a plan to triple the number of CCS wells in the Decatur area and sequester up to seven million metric tons of CO2 per year. This positions ADM as a clear leader in the ability to supply customers with low-carbon feedstocks and accelerate the decarbonization of their own value chain. And we think this is just the beginning. I'll speak more about how we are defining that next phase as we wrap up. Now I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram? Thank you, Vikram. Before we wrap up today, I wanted to share some insights into how we're thinking about the remainder of 2023 and how we are positioning the company to take on the next phase of opportunities. We are confident that ADM will be able to deliver on our plans for 2023 despite some pockets of soft demand. Supply and demand shift are allowing ADM to flex our integrated value chain, in support of another strong year of results. We continue to advance partnership agreements with major players across multiple industries from regenerative agriculture to alternative proteins, to sustainable fuels, to plant-based industrial and personal care products. All of these partnerships are supporting ADM as we evolve at pace with the external environment to capture new growth opportunities. We see accelerated upsides emerging from product areas like biosolutions expected to grow at double-digit rates again this year. We have significant production capacity coming online within the year across our three businesses to support continued demand growth. And we're driving forward the broad-based decarbonization agenda in our Decatur complex, which is unlocking both near-term and long-range value for our customers across multiple industries. With a combination of solid business performance in the core business, along with the strong growth opportunities across our value chain, we expect that we will be able to deliver between $6 to $7 in earnings per share in 2023 and based on the strength of our balance sheet and cash position, we continue to pursue opportunities to deliver both near-term value to shareholders while positioning ADM for its next phase of growth. We're anticipating an in-depth review of the opportunities we see and the path ahead with the investment community in the fourth quarter. We'll share more details on this event in the coming months. Thank you for your time today, Vikram and I look forward to answering any questions you may have. With that, Bailey, please open the line for questions. Good morning, Tom. I think you're right in your assessment that maybe second quarter will come a little bit lower and then right, crush margins will raise for the second part of the year. In the coming quarter, crush is expected to remain strong, but lower than the prior year period, as you said, based on covering crush margins as well as impact from mark-to-market that pull profits into Q1. Remember those $100 million that Vikram mentioned before. So margins will remain solid, but again, lower probably than the prior year while canola crush margins look to be improved in the upside. If you think about the whole year, crush is position for another extremely strong year in 2023, the fundamentals of the business remain strong and the structural changes are driving increased demand for both vegetable oil and meal. In 2022, remember, Tom, we have significant dislocations around the world. Likewise, 2023 will be influenced by any new dislocations which may or may not happen. Remember that while Argentina and South America is crushing hard now, Argentina will probably run out of beans given their small crop, later in the year. And at that point in time, certainly the market will have to cover for that lack of meal being exported from Argentina. We think that's where the U.S. crush margins will pick up, and that's what the curves are showing. So I think with record world soybean production, we expect soybean meal will gain in the inclusions in global \u2013 Russians and we are going to have also on our own side, we're going to have a Spiritwood coming in at the end of Q3. And also we are going to have Paraguay coming back online at that point and Ukraine also. So when you think about this operational improvements and higher refining volumes and strong refining margins we are due for a very, very strong year in ag services and oilseeds in 2023. Bailey, any other questions? Good morning, Adam. Yes, Adam. So this is no different from what we signaled in the Q4 call. We had clearly indicated that the first half nutrition is going to be weak and the strength is going to come in the second half. So let's break it down. In human nutrition, as we mentioned, we've got a strong pipeline and actually customers are looking for more and more innovation, and that plays to our strengths, given our broad capabilities and our suite of ingredients. So we see a very robust pipeline, double-digit increase in pipeline and increasing win rates. So that's point number one. Point number two is that destocking effects should neutralize, we expect inventory levels to come back to regular levels. And then the third is also you relate the demand fulfillment challenges, which we experienced mainly in the back half of last year. We are working through that. We need to expect most of these issues to be resolved in the second half of this year. So a combination of a very strong pipeline, less destocking, as well as less demand fulfillment challenges gives us confidence for back half loaded growth and human nutrition. We'll still have growth in the second quarter. We expect maybe mid single-digit growth in the second quarter. So you can see the progress roughly flat in Q1, mid single-digit growth in Q2, and the back half should be significantly higher versus the back half of last year, which was challenged by demand fulfillment. Then on animal nutrition on the pet side, we still have double-digit growth in pipeline, so we see that category continue to be strong if you remember, we signal demand fulfillment challenges also in pet. We expect also that to be addressed over the course of this year, mainly in the second half, we are expecting some new capacity also to come online in the second half for pet. So we feel pretty good about pet. On the animal nutrition side, that's been challenged because we had significant contribution from amino acids in Q1, Q2, and also Q3 of last year. So we are lapping those margins, so it's going to take time and that's why it's going to be back half loaded. We also see weakness generally in feed demand as feed customers are looking at reformulation and consumers are going from higher value protein to lower value protein, but we are taking actions while volume is anticipated, be flat to slightly lower. We are working to improve margins by very, very targeted cost actions and as well as go-to-market actions that I referenced. So we feel good about the back half on animal nutrition from a turnaround perspective. So that's the reason why nutrition is shaping up to be a second half story for the reasons I cited, but we feel strong and good about the 10% plus constant currency OP growth in nutrition for 2023. Thank you, Ben. Yes, thank you, Ben. A full question there. So listen, ag service has delivered another very, very strong quarter this year. It was strong in South America, it was strong in North America. It was strong at the global trade through all our destination marketing facilities. So when you look at the Q2, of course, in Q1 we were able to export a little bit more than maybe Brazil couldn't do it because of some of the rains and the delays. We think that in Q2 and Brazil will probably take over being the large crop that they have and the cheapest origin. Destination marketing was still holding margins there. It is an important activity around the world. You describe the risks associated. When we think about the year, the year hinges a lot in the recovery of demand in China lockdowns, the ups and downs of the crops around the world. We still have to deal with an Argentine disaster in terms of crops, and with the Brazil that has very strong crop. That is creating changes in the trade flows. So all of a sudden, we are sending beans from the U.S. to Europe to transform into biodiesel and bringing the biodiesel back, but also Brazil is sending beans to Argentina; Brazil, maybe sending a little bit of both or beans here. So there is a lot of changes in that, and that's ADM normally takes advantage of our huge footprint and normally our footprint and our ability to execute on those trade flows become an advantage. So you're going to see that in ag services around the year. I said there are two pivoting things this year. One is, again China demand coming out of lockdown. The second is the ability of Ukraine to continue to export as we have been doing during since August last year. Of course, the corridor has been renewed as ADM, we will always do our best to make sure that that continuous and export source for the Ukrainians, remember that that part of the world owns 25% of all the black rich soil in the world. So it's a very important condition \u2013 very important production area. So the corridor has been renewed, but of course, there are differences between Ukrainians view and Russian views at this point in time. And unfortunately, we have seen over the last week at the inspection of vessels being reduced to maybe a few days per week. So we remain hopeful and we remain ready to help to do this. I think that what we need to think fundamentally, the corridor is all about the availability of bringing that production. What I worry or the accessibility better said, what I worry is about the availability of the crop. This prolonged conflict is hurting the Ukrainian farmers and is hurting the Russian farmers. Both are dealing with issues, and I think that the expectation should be the conflict not resolved for production out of this area to come lower over the coming years, regardless of the export corridor. So I think, again, short-term and accessibility issue, long-term or medium-term, I worry more about availability and creating the pockets of tension again. Yes, Andrew. I think we feel pretty good or that we will execute very well in this segment and probably exceed last year's performance. We have good visibility given the book that we have. So demand continues to be there strong and we continue to execute well. We see the margins and they continue to be there with us. So there has been some comments about maybe a slower ramp up of some facilities. It's very difficult to predict, the ramp up of specific facilities, but when you look at all the data, you see all that material coming, soybean oil will continue to be a key feedstock for this. It's impossible to develop all this industry without the participation of soybean oil. Now we have a path for canola oil to get to that source. U.S. biodiesel production was up 8% in Q1. Renewable diesel production was up like 61% versus the previous year. We continue to flex our system to be able to bring biodiesel from Europe to benefit the U.S. industry. And as I said before, we expect a year that will be better than last year. And given the affordable book that we have, we have visibility into that. So we feel very confident about this, Andrew. Good morning, Ben, Thank you, Eric. Good morning. Yes, Eric, let me take you a little bit higher because the gyrations of ethanol up and down sometimes get confused, but we invest for the long-term here. So fundamentally if you think about the last IPCC [ph] report, it strongly argue that it's going to be difficult for humanity to stay in the 1.5 degree hitting that we should try to achieve based on the Paris agreement. If you think about that, then adaptation is what all companies and all governments are thinking about. Biofuels and bioproducts like biomaterials or biosolutions are a key part of that adaptation. So whether it's ethanol \u2013 whether it's ethanol getting in a pathway to SAF, whether it's renewable green diesel, whether it is biodiesel that's going to be a big part of the future. And ADM's strong position in that and competitive advantage will shine through. We see the same thing as we position ourselves for biosolutions or biomaterials. Again, this is just \u2013 you're going to see governments, you're going to see companies, you're going to see everybody having to work together to achieve this energy transition, if you will, and to be able to keep climate change to a level that is manageable. But you have to think biofuels will be an important part of the future. U.S. will be a key player in biofuel and ADM will be absolutely in a strong position to deliver on that. Thank you. Yes. So at the moment, we operate one well, we're going to activate the second well and then bring five new wells. Each well from a capital perspective is not a big burden. It's something about $15 million to $20 million per well depending on the cost of metals and all that. So we probably are in the high end of $20 million in the low end or something like $12 million to $15 million. The time line every time we need to have a well finished is about three months. So it's relatively quickly. The issue is you need to go through regulatory approvals and that's where we are working where government affairs team is working heavily with dedicator area and with some of the farmers in the area. So again, it could happen relatively quickly, probably within the next couple of years, if you will, not a big burden from a capital perspective, but will significantly increase our ability to pump CO2 underground. As I said, if today we have about 1 million tons, give or take per year, this will take us to 7 million, and it will be a significant boost to the decarbonization of Decatur and Decatur becoming through supplier of low-carbon intensity feedstocks for many industries. Thank you, Ben. Thank you for the question. Yes, as you said, coming along with the development of the industry, ADM wants to be pressed bringing crush capacity. We're doing that, as you know in a partnership with an oil company. So they have the ability to move that product to make it into the fuel market. We have the responsibility to move, of course, the meal for which we've been working on. The plant is coming thankfully on time and on schedule to be with us by the harvest. So about the Q3, as I said in my remarks, the 150,000 tons bushels per day of crush capacity. We look at the industry. I always mentioned or I mentioned before that we look at this plant and project for two years to make sure that capacity was coming on stream prudently. We see now the industry. We see all the capacity that is coming, is all needed to be able to supply this I think the renewal diesel industry is still going to have an issue how to get feedstock for that. So that will be the issue for a while. I think that will make meal \u2013 U.S. meal very competitive in the world markets and the U.S. is planning to take share, we are part of that plan as well. So we feel comfortable about the cadence at which the plants are coming. Maybe some of our renewable diesel plants are coming a little bit slower than expected. Every project has its issues. Thankfully, ours is not delayed. But if others are, I think it's going to facilitate a little bit the digestion of all this capacity that is coming because we need to get the fit for that. I think Vikram will cover the second part of your question on RVOs. Thank you, Salvator, for the question. So as you said, Ag Services has a very, very good first quarter. This team continues to deliver and outperform sometimes on our own expectations. If you think about global trade and all the issues around the world sometimes are difficult to estimate, if you will but our team with their ability to connect, if you will origins with destinations and especially with the investments that we have made over the years on destination markets and allow us to capture more volume at higher margins than maybe in the past. They have had also a very disciplined risk management and very effective one, which we expect from them, but sometimes it's not that easy to deliver in this volatile world. Great execution in Australia, great execution on the Black Sea, origination program and again a solid margins at destination. South America were probably another bright point for us. They capture higher volumes and margins. We were very well positioned on a crop that was very large and on a farmer that was undersold. So we position ourselves properly, and we get the rewards from that. And North America benefited from a strong risk management and a strong bean export programs. Again, Brazil was a little bit delay with some of the rains and all that in terms of their harvest. So the U.S. extended the window a little bit more. Now Brazil, we think \u2013 if you think about second quarter and what we're predicting it to be a little bit lower is we're not going to have \u2013 if you think about second quarter last year, the same volatility that we have because of Ukraine at that point in time. And the world was starting and the world was a little bit stunned on what we do now. Now we know what do we do? We have channels to export; the product is flowing for the most part. As I warned in my previous question, I think we're more worried about the productivity of the farmers of Ukraine and Russia eventually later on. But I think for this year, we have the ability to export that. We expect robust North American corn exports until Brazil second con crop is available. And then I think that North America will lap until Brazil run out of core. So we have lower North American soy exports expected in the second quarter because Brazil will take that place. So it's a little bit the shift if you will. And the decrease of that shift to be honest, Salvator sometimes are marked by the logistics issues. Brazil has a large corn crop and soybean crop, and it needs to be able to move that to the ports and being able to ship it. And then you have the Ukraine issue we discussed before. So those are the puts and takes. In general, as I said, the unit is performing very well, performed exceptionally well in the first quarter. We expect them to perform stronger in the second quarter, but maybe not as strong as second quarter last year. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 6. The Ag Services & Oilseeds team had an outstanding start to 2023, with significantly higher year-over-year results in Q1. Ag Services results were much higher than the first quarter of 2022. In South American origination, excellent risk management and higher export demand due to the record Brazilian soybean crop drove significantly higher year-over-year results. In North America, origination results were also higher, driven by stronger soybean exports. In global trade, solid margins and efficient execution led to strong results. Crushing results were in line with the first quarter last year. In North America, the team executed well, capitalizing on historically strong soybean and softseed crush margins that were supported by robust demand for renewable fuels. In EMEA, crush margins were lower year-over-year as trade flows adjusted from the dislocations caused last year by the war in Ukraine. Additionally, there were approximately $240 million of positive timing effects during the quarter, which included both expected reversals of prior timing losses as we executed the business as well as a positive impact of about $100 million pulled forward from future periods as crush margins declined at the end of the quarter. Refined products and other results were substantially higher than the prior year period. North America biodiesel results were higher with record volumes and strong margins, supported by favorable blend economics and tight diesel stocks. In EMEA, domestic demand for food, oil and export demand for biodiesel drove strong margins. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the first quarter of 2022. Looking ahead for the second quarter, we expect RPO to continue its strong performance. Crushing is expected to be strong, but lower than the prior year based on current crush margins. We do not expect last year's significant volatility that impacted energy and grain trade flows to reoccur in Ag Services. Slide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered solid results in Q1, though lower than the very strong first quarter of the prior year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment capitalized on solid demand in the quarter. North America Starches and Sweeteners delivered strong volumes and margins. Ethanol margins, pressured by high industry stock levels, were down relative to the same quarter last year. In EMEA, the team effectively managed margins in a dynamic operating environment to deliver improved results. The global wheat milling business posted much higher margins driven by robust customer demand. BioSolutions continued on its strong growth trajectory with revenues increasing by over 20% year-over-year. Vantage Corn Processors' results were significantly lower due to weaker ethanol margins. Looking ahead, for the second quarter, we expect resilient demand and strong margins for our Starches and Sweeteners products. Ethanol margins, while improving, are expected to remain below last year. Of note, we also recognized a $50 million benefit from a biofuel producer tax credit in the prior year quarter that will not repeat. On Slide 8, Nutrition results were significantly lower year-over-year versus the record prior year quarter. Human Nutrition results were in line with the first quarter of 2022 as the business continued to manage demand fulfillment challenges and destocking in certain categories. Flavors results were slightly lower than the prior year as strong results in EMEA were offset by lower results in North America. Specialty Ingredients results were higher year-over-year, driven by healthy margins. Health and Wellness was lower year-over-year. In Animal Nutrition, results were significantly lower compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to much lower margins in amino acids. The Animal Nutrition business, excluding PET, is expected to face challenging demand conditions over the course of the year, and we are taking actions to mitigate the impact. These actions include targeted cost reductions, refining our go-to-market strategy with a more customer-centric approach, optimizing our production footprint, particularly in EMEA and refocusing resources on our strongest growth categories. Looking ahead for the second quarter, we expect year-over-year profit growth at Human Nutrition, while Animal Nutrition will still be lapping the higher amino acid margins from the prior year. For the full year, we expect to achieve 10% plus constant currency operating profit growth in Nutrition, led by Human Nutrition. And with continued recovery in demand fulfillment and reduced destocking effects, we remain optimistic about our Human Nutrition sales pipeline and growth opportunities. As we noted before, operating profit growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Slide 9, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher interest income. Captive insurance results were in line with the prior year. In Corporate, unallocated corporate costs of $248 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to higher financing and centers of excellence costs. Other corporate was unfavorable versus the prior year due to the absence of an ADM Ventures, investment revaluation gain, partially offset by higher contribution from foreign currency hedges. We still project corporate costs to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year. Net interest expense for the quarter increased $27 million year-over-year due primarily to higher short-term interest rates. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was approximately 16%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. In the first quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $1.3 billion. We allocated $325 million to capital expenditures as well as returned $600 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to have ample liquidity with nearly $10 billion of cash and available credit. And our adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.2 is well below our 2.5x threshold. Our strong balance sheet and single A credit rating provide a stable financial footing for ADM to pursue our strategic growth initiatives, while also returning capital to shareholders. In 2023, we still anticipate $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and $1 billion of opportunistic buybacks subject to other strategic uses of capital. Juan? Well, so on starches and sweeteners, you're right. Let's break it down. The liquid sweetener part of the portfolio, we see resilient demand and strong margins given the good contracting we had last year, and we also see increased volumes from Mexico, which helps the business. The other thing that should help over the course of the year is higher sugar prices. While, you know, we don't have a lot of spot business, but to the extent we do that should be supportive of margins and the liquid sweetener side of the portfolio. The specialty side, we are seeing strong margins, but some softness in the volumes. That's also part of sweeteners and starches. In the biosolutions, when you think about the mix of the portfolio, we are moving more and more towards the BioSolutions business. And that had very strong performance consistently over the last few years and again in Q1 with 20-plus percent growth in revenue and anticipated to continue at that clip for the course of this year. So at a high level Sweeteners and Starches, good volumes and robust margins, so it should give us confidence that we'll have a very good year again in 2023. Now with respect to ethanol, that remains the most volatile part of our portfolio, Q1 was soft. We think Q2 is going to be a little better, although lower than Q2 of last year. We had the biofuel tax credit, which we referenced, which will not repeat. But we also see some green shoots on the ethanol side. We are more constructive about the outlook of ethanol for the rest of the year. Why, for a few reasons. One is, we see ethanol stock levels coming off their peaks from earlier in Q1. Two, we continue to see good export demand. Think about what's happening even in Japan and India. So our export demand should be in the 1.2 billion, 1.4 billion gallons, which is consistent with what we saw last year. We also see higher blending rates. I think blend rates have trended slightly up. Gasoline demand continues to be strong given the strong blend economics. So in short, while we think ethanol will likely be low from an absolute margin perspective versus last year, we're still constructive generally for the rest of the year. So overall, we see a pretty strong year for Carbohydrate Solutions business. Yes. So on the crush margins, as Juan noted, clearly, as you can also see in the curve right now, Q2 looks soft. And the reason is because of the expectation of a certain delay in renewable green diesel capacity. Just to be clear, we remain confident that renewable green diesel capacity is going to increase by about 1 billion gallons in 2023. The time line has just been pushed back to the second half of this year. So therefore, you see a little bit of softness in the nearby as a consequence of that. The other aspect is also related to what's happening in Argentina. In Argentina, there given \u2013 there's more beans given what's happened with the soy dollar for at least part of Q2, there's more crush capacity, if you may, that's coming online, and that's also helping reduce a little bit of the nearby crush. What's going to happen in Argentina by May or June time frame, they're going to run out of beans. So that export is not going to be available. So that should be supportive of crush margins beyond Q2. And that's why you see the slight inverse in the curve in the nearby and then recovering in the back half of the year. So that's really all that happened. It was transitory, nothing that is more than that is the delay in renewable green diesel capacity as well as what's happening in Argentina \u2013 in Argentina. Yes. As you know, Ben, in December the RVO proposal that came out was largely constructive for the biofuels industry and we appreciated the multiyear proposal as well as the strong support for conventional ethanol. We, however, did note in our testimony and written comments to the EPA, the opportunity for improvement in the advanced category of biomass-based diesel. And it's important to note that does not, in any way change our assessment of the strong renewable diesel capacity growth this year and beyond. And this is going to come out in June. We expect that the EPA is going to consider the feedback they've got from the industry, and we are constructive about what that outlook is going to look like. But nevertheless, we are confident about the growth of the renewable diesel capacity and the ongoing benefit and impact for crush margins going forward."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\nMegan Britt: Hello and welcome to the third quarter earnings call for ADM. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Juan Luciano, Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks on the call today, which are posted on the investor relations sections of the ADM website and through the link to our webcast. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance, and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation and the materials. To the extent permitted by law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements due to new information or future events. In addition, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP or adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available on our earnings press release and presentation slides, which can be found in the investor relations section of the ADM website. Please turn to slide four. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Megan. Hello and welcome to all who have joined the call. We sincerely appreciate your patience as we work expeditiously to amend the company's fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2024. We are pleased to now be able to share more context about our 2024 year-to-date financial results and our outlook. Even that we are holding this call later than usual, we're also in a position to provide qualitative color on how the fourth quarter is progressing. To start, let's recap our financial results for the company. ADM reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 and a total segment operating profit of $1 billion. This brings adjusted earnings per share to $3.61 and our total segment operating profit to $3.2 billion year-to-date for 2024. Our trailing four-quarter adjusted ROIC was 8.8%. Although we made progress on several important initiatives in 2024, this results are not consistent with the high bar that we have set for our team. While we have seen a decline in our total segment operating profit and a decline in operating cash flow before working capital changes, due to lower net earnings relative to the prior year period, discipline management of our balance sheet continues to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. In total, we have returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders with $744 million in the form of dividends and $2.3 billion in share repurchases year-to-date in 2024. Next slide, please. Entering 2024, we laid out key priorities for value creation based on the year we saw ahead of us. And as we moved into the fourth quarter, it's clear that certain expectations have not all play out as anticipated. The global commodity landscape has continued to shift. Stronger-than-expected supply has driven commodity prices down further than anticipated. Canola crash margins have been negatively impacted by regulatory uncertainty and higher seed prices. In addition, China has begun to increase local commodity production and has had a slower pace of demand recovery, negatively impacting the trade of certain commodities and uptake of animal nutrition solutions. We're also seeing the trailing effects of inflation in part of our business. Some new nutrition projects have been delayed as some customers look for opportunities to manage costs by simplifying their consumer offerings. We have also seen some softness in demand in other end markets such as pet treats and energy drinks where consumers are prioritizing their discretionary spending. The global regulatory environment has led to additional uncertainties. Programs such as EUDR and the U.S. producers tax credit are still not fully in place, which has left various stakeholders in the Ag supply-chain without the confidence of a clear path forward. Beyond these external factors creating downward pressure, we're also managing through a balance of both positive and challenging results across our own operational environment. In carbohydrate solutions, we've been able to improve production throughout the network, in part due to advancements in automation and digitization at the plant level, as well as by finding synergies across our milling network. We've seen similar improvements in our crush facilities in LatAm and EMEA, but this has been offset today by the fact that opportunities previously identified in some of our U.S. plants have been taking longer-than-expected to be completed. However, in October, we began to see improvements in unplanned downtime in our U.S. facilities. Nutrition has continued to manage through the downtime of our Decatur East facility, where our expected ramp up has been delayed from the end of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025 as safe restoration of operations is a top priority. And while the integration of our most recent Flavor acquisitions has driven positive results, we have experienced demand fulfillment issues due to the complexity of other integration efforts. We believe that our business is well-positioned to grow alongside enduring global trends such as the expansion of functional food and beverage alternatives, the replacement of petroleum-based products across multiple industries and the broader opportunity associated with decarbonization. As we look at the near-term in 2025, however, we anticipate that we could still be managing through a challenging cycle, and we have already begun taking necessary productivity actions with a clear focus on cost and cash management. This slide highlights several of the areas we have already taken action on in 2024, along with additional actions we are aggressively driving at the end of the year. As we manage through the current cycle, we've seen success in delivering expansion across strategic initiatives such as regen ag, BioSolutions and destination marketing, which achieved record volume handled in October, supporting supply and demand needs through increasing capacity. This is example in our Spiritwood facility, which has achieved near full run-rates in the month of October. And in ramping up the drive for execution excellence program, which has already begun to deliver toward our cost-saving goals. Moving forward, as we expand our focus on procurement and execution excellence, we believe that we can double this program's target cost savings over the next few years. In addition, the automation and digitization efforts that have already achieved millions in cost savings are being scoped and accelerated across the other plants in our footprint. Turning to Nutrition's recovery efforts. To-date we have strengthened our operational leadership, driven simplification and optimization opportunities and continued to expand our pipeline and win rates in part of the portfolio such as flavors. These efforts are now being supplemented to increase the pace of recovery. We have placed additional focus on demand generation, supply-chain improvement and rightsizing our production to better flex to the needs of the dynamic demand environment. And finally, from a strategic capital allocation perspective, we have already accelerated our return of cash to shareholders this year in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Going forward, we're being extremely prudent on focusing our attention on cash generation opportunities, while considering specific portfolio optimization efforts to simplify operations, enhance our focus and drive an improvement in ROIC. Along with all these actions, Monish joining as CFO has already brought new perspectives to the team. We are using his experience to help identify and accelerate paths for continuous recovery. With this, let me pass to Monish for a more detailed financial review. Monish?\nMonish Patolawala: Thank you, Juan. First, I would like to take a moment to say how excited I am to be joining the ADM team at such an important point in the company's trajectory. While I've only been on the job for a few months, I have enjoyed the opportunity to personally engage with our teams and learn the company. I want to thank all my ADM colleagues for their warm welcome. Turning to Slide 6. On a year-to-date basis, AS&O segment operating profit of $1.8 billion was 42% lower versus the prior year period as ample supplies out of South America have driven lower commodity prices and margins across the segment. Ag services sub-segment operating profit of $461 was 52% lower versus the prior year, driven by lower South American origination margins and volumes, in part due to industry take-or-pay contracts. The stabilization of trade flows has also led to fewer opportunities in our global trade business, leading to lower results. Crushing sub-segment operating profit of $632 million was 30% lower versus the prior year period. Slower farmer selling and lower crush rates in Argentina, coupled with solid demand has supported soy crush margins leading to a year-to-date executed soy crush margin of approximately $50 per metric ton, which is lower, compared to the prior year. While year-to-date executed canola crush margins are lower by approximately $15 per ton, compared to the prior year, margins have moderated significantly in the second-half of the year so far, as higher seed prices and regulatory uncertainty drove lower margins. There were net negative timing impacts of approximately $120 million year-over-year. In the refined products and other sub segment, increased pre-treatment capacity at renewable diesel facilities and higher imports of used cooking oil has negatively impacted both refining and biodiesel margins, leading to sub-segment operating profit that was 58% lower versus the prior year. There were net negative timing impacts of approximately $360 million year-over-year. As we look forward, we anticipate AS&O fourth quarter results to be lower than the prior year quarter. The seasonal shift to our North American weighted footprint and strong North American crop should be supportive of volumes. But recent elevation margins are below the levels we expected when we put our guidance in place in November. In crushing, the ramp-up of our Spiritwood facility is expected to support high-single-digit volume improvement. However, we expect lower results due to lower soya and canola crush margins versus the prior year. The addition of new pre-treatment capacity has continued to weigh on margins within the RPO business and on the food oil side, margins for free-to-sell opportunities have been under pressure, due to increased competition. Based on the information available today, we also anticipate 100% reinsurance proceeds of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter related to both Decatur West and East. We continue to monitor the impact of uncertainty related to regulation and trade flows on the operating environment as we look forward to the end of the year. Year-to-date, carbohydrate solutions segment operating profit of $1.1 billion in the year-to-date period was roughly in line with the prior year as lower margins in the EMEA region and ethanol were mostly offset by strong volumes and improved manufacturing costs. As we look forward, a strong North American corn supply and robust export demand is export expected to be supportive of VCP. However, North American ethanol production continues to outpace demand, driving lower margins. We expect to see solid demand and margins in North American starches and sweeteners as we finish the year. Wheat milling margins are expected to moderate from elevated prior-year levels. Based on information available today, we also anticipate 100% reinsured insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter related to both Decatur East and West incident of approximately $35 million. Taken together, we anticipate the carbohydrate solutions fourth quarter results to be in line with the prior year period. Year-to-date, revenues from nutrition were $5.6 billion, up 2%, compared to the prior year. On an organic basis, segment revenue was down 3%. Human nutrition was flat organically as headwinds related to Decatur East and texturants pricing offset growth in flavors and health and wellness. Animal nutrition revenue declined 5%, driven by unfavorable mix, negative currency impacts in Brazil and low volumes due to demand fulfillment challenges. Year-to-date nutrition sub-segment operating profit of $298 million was 32% lower versus the prior year. Human nutrition results of $265 million were 40% lower, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by unplanned downtime at Decatur East. Animal nutrition results of $33 million were slightly higher, compared to the prior year, due to an improvement in margins. As we finish the year, we expect continued weak consumer demand, lower texturants prices and ongoing operational challenges to be a headwind. And as Juan previously mentioned, we now anticipate the start-up of our Decatur East facility to be delayed until the first quarter of 2025. We expect the impact of prolonged downtime at Decatur East to be partially offset by 100% reinsurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of approximately $50 million based on the information available today. We expect animal nutrition results in the fourth quarter to be better than the prior year with tailwinds from our turnaround efforts and as we continue to work through operational challenges in pet solutions. Taken together, we expect nutrition results for the fourth quarter likely lower than the third quarter of 2024, but to be higher than the prior year, which had negative impact of approximately $64 million in non-recurring items. Please turn to slide seven. Year-to-date in 2024 the company has generated cash flow from operations before working capital of approximately $2.3 billion, down relative to the same period last year, due to lower segment operating profit. Despite the decline, solid cash generation has supported our ability to invest in our business and return excess cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, the company has returned $3.1 billion in cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Allocated $1.1 billion to capital expenditures and nearly $1 billion to M&A announced in 2023 and completed in January 2024. Our capital structure continues to provide the financial flexibility to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. We continue to see opportunities to drive enhanced cash generation through operating improvements both in our facilities and through better management of working capital. We believe investing in organic opportunities gives us the best return. While we will always look at opportunistic M&A as a way to enhance return, it is essential that we prioritize maximizing returns from the assets that we have already acquired and also ensuring that we are the best owners of all our assets. Now let's transition to a discussion of guidance for 2024 on slide eight. In early November, we announced that we lowered our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.50 per share to $5 per share. The lowering of our guide takes into account our year-to-date results and headwinds from slow market demand and internal operational challenges. Additionally, we now anticipate our corporate cost to be within the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and our corporate net interest expense to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion. We are also increasing our effective tax-rate guidance to the range of 20% to 22%, due to the non-deductible impairment of Wilmar taken in the third quarter. Our expectations for our leverage ratio and D&A are unchanged. Let's turn to slide nine to close the call with a reflection on the key priorities that we are driving with our team to deliver improvement and enhance return. First, my top priority is ensuring integrity and accuracy in our internal controls and financial reporting. I echo Juan's earlier statement and add my particular thanks for the extraordinary efforts of our team to amend and file the restated financials for fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2024. We are continuing to focus on implementing enhancements to our internal controls to remediate the previously identified material weakness and are taking action to enhance the integrity and accuracy within internal controls and financial reporting related to intersegment sales. Among other things, the design and documentation of the execution of pricing and measurement and reporting controls for segment disclosure purposes and projected financial information used in impairment analysis have been enhanced and the testing of these controls will continue throughout the balance of the year. Further, training for relevant personnel on the measurement of intersegment sales and application of relevant accounting guidance to intersegment sales has been provided and remains ongoing. In the broader category of improving focus and execution, the team will remain adaptable and focus on items within our control. On the cost side, we are optimizing our cost structure and enhancing operational resilience initiatives. In this vein, we have the opportunity to create a more cohesive digital strategy. Today, we have invested in numerous efforts to improve our systems and enable a more digital footing for our business. However, we have the opportunity to connect these efforts to accelerate outcomes around how we serve our customers, operate our assets and run the enterprise, while also delivering structural cost improvement. Similarly, we have room in our portfolio and broader asset network to optimize through targeted divestitures or rationalization and we are evaluating numerous actions that we could take to improve our footprint performance and generate cash. We will also maintain a sharp focus on working capital management to further strengthen our cash position. Lastly, we'll remain disciplined in capital allocation, seeking opportunities to drive ROIC and enhance returns. I see maintaining our capital discipline as essential to value creation. We will work to ensure that we maintain a healthy balance sheet that continues to create strong cash flow and that we rigor investment opportunities appropriately by applying a stage-gated model to ensure that we are achieving key milestones and meeting our return objectives to continue to invest. In closing, I want to take a moment to thank our ADM colleagues for their hard work and dedication this quarter. I am optimistic that today we can successfully tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy and focus on delivering value for our shareholders. With that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and I appreciate all the color you gave on the outlook and the strategy. I was hoping that you could help reconcile the decline in U.S. crush margins over the last several weeks. You have now a U.S. crush margin curve that's much lower in the nearby than in the spring, which is abnormal. You have soybean meal delivery certificates issued last week by some of the commercials, which I also believe is abnormal. So I guess the question is, what does all of this tell us about where crush margins are headed and how much visibility do you have on crush into next year compared to what you would typically have for this time of year? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. As you said, board crash rallied steadily from the lows in Q3, but has come under pressure in November. And it's basically a combination of things. First of all, demand for the products have been very good. Demand for meal is good, demand for oil around the world is good. But you see during November, we have the Argentine farmers started to sell again. So we've seen higher crush rates in Argentina. There are high crush rates in Brazil and NOPA here in North America, all our plants have been running well, so we have high crush in October. When you combine that with the regulatory uncertainty now we have in the oil side, that has created the problems that we have. The U.S. is exporting oil, the U.S. is exporting mill, but there is more pressure in the system with more crush being put and less regulatory clarity. So that's why overall message, Andrew, is as we look forward here, we think that given the soft markets and the regulatory uncertainty, our focus in ADM is on the things that we can control on the double down on productivity, looking at all our efforts in trying to control cost and cash and certainly portfolio management. So that's kind of our priority for the year. The markets remain robust. Soybean meal is the most competitive feed out there. So demand is strong and oil is needed for the biofuels market and oil is needed for human consumption. So I think that when we clear the regulatory environment or regulatory uncertainty, if you will, I think you're going to see things normalizing a bit.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay. And sorry, if I could just quickly follow up. Given all of the internal actions that you guys are focused on as you kind of navigate the cycle, and if I were to kind of exclude some of the insurance dynamics from this year and maybe from next year as well, do you think that this is kind of an earnings base from which you would expect those actions to drive earnings growth in 2025 or do you think about it as still kind of navigating through kind of a muddled environment as we get through the regulatory dynamics, how do you think about kind of this year and actions that you're taking in the ability to grow in '25? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I think it's important never to lose an opportunity to get yourself extra feet. So we are taking this decline in margins as an opportunity to review everything from ADM and accelerate all the decisions that were already ongoing. So I will, you know it's too early in the year. There are too many unknowns, Andrew, to especially on the regulatory front to make a forecast for the year. But we know that focusing on the things we can control continue to drive cash flows, that's an important thing for our shareholders and that will improve returns.\nMonish Patolawala: Andrew, I echo what Juan just said, it's back to the basics of cash cost and capital. And that's what we are focused on right now. Lot of opportunities head-down, get 2024 closed and we'll come back when we're ready to discuss 2025. But we know the environment is going to be soft and that's why the teams are controlling what they control.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTom Palmer: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to enquire on the nutrition side of the business. We've seen some changes in terms of the animal nutrition business, I think from a cost-savings standpoint that's driven some improved profitability. What about on the human nutrition side? Is there just given some of the end-markets maybe haven't progressed the way you once anticipated thought to kind of resizing that business? And maybe how much of an opportunity might that be as we think about the coming year? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, thank you, Tom, for the question. Listen, I think I will take it by pieces. If you take human nutrition, you have to separate. We have a big issue with the plant that is down. That plant is a significant cost. It was down for a full-year, now it's going to be down for the first quarter. And so that's an issue that is a little bit of extraordinary that we're fixing, and we thank all the engineers and everybody working expeditiously to bring it back safe. On the rest of the business is the flavors business and the health and wellness business, we continue to see opportunities. We've seen in the positive side, if you will, we've seen growth of flavors -- revenue flavors in Europe of about 7% like-for-like, so organic growth year-to-date. We have seen 5% in North America. These are not the growth rate that we were expected when we started the year because there has been some categories like energy drinks where although still growing, is growing at less -- at lower rates than we expected at the beginning of the year and our customers have expected at the beginning of the year. Some launches has been postponed, but still is a robust category and we still see growth. But as you said, we are adjusting a little bit our supply-chain to make sure we match the new realities. When you look at the other piece of human nutrition, which is health and wellness, the probiotics part, which is the part there that is the future, it is the growth part has grown so far 14% year-over-year on a revenue side, and even higher than that in operating profit side. So I think that there are good signs, but we continue to flex this. This is a year in which, as you understand, nutrition is not where we want them to be, and we are working hard to fix it. But there are on the customer side, there are positive signs that makes us believe that when we put some of these supply issues behind, we're going to see the results coming to the P&L in a bigger way.\nTom Palmer: Okay. Thank you. And just on the capital allocation, it sounds like there was some mention in the prepared remarks of maybe some focus on discipline, but there was also some commentary maybe on the crush side about some unexpected downtime. Is there may be an elevated maintenance CapEx cycle needed in the crush operation to kind of get it to the operational levels that you desire? And if so, might we expect maybe less of a step-down in CapEx next year just given that or maybe I'm overstating it? A - Juan Luciano No, listen, CapEx for next year will be solid CapEx, if you will. We have many plants, we have grown the company and we need to make sure those plants stay in good shape. But also there are opportunities for automation and digitization that we are adding to that. If you look at the oilseeds plants, Europe and Latin America have been operating very, very well. We have a handful of plants in North America that have given us problems over the summer, and I'm happy to report that they are doing better in October, they are doing better in November. But we have some issues that took a little bit longer to fix than we thought and we put the resources to do so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Yes, good morning, and thanks for taking question. Good morning. So just wanted to like kind of get a little bit maybe your sensitivities around the implied guidance for the fourth quarter and taking a little bit of an advantage that we're early in December and already two months have gone past. Clearly, if we look at it implied low-end versus high-end, it's very widespread? So maybe help us understand and frame a little bit what are the risks getting closer to the lower end, which would be implied a little less than $1 versus the higher piece closer to $140, just to kind of understand where we're shaking out and where you think things are going out considering that two months are in?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Ben. So let me give you the puts and takes for the quarter and you can build it from there. I think in -- if you think about the grain business ag services, of course, this is the quarter in which the volumes come to North America for exports. And we see good volumes. China is buying for Q4, beans, Europe is buying corn for Q1. But we have -- although we have good volumes, we have not seen the margin expansion that maybe we have forecasted a couple of quarters or a couple of months ago. River logistics are good for December. We will have to monitor the weather for Q1, but so far so good. And calories in the market should help our interior assets. On a global trade perspective, volumes are strong and lower commodity prices are supporting feeding animals globally. So destination marketing margins are holding. On the crush side, I described before the decline in crush margins, you know, a lot of uncertainty about biofuels policy, of course. This margin compression could create timing depending on where prices are at the end of the year, we could see positive timing. So we will not be able to call that until we see the end of December. We have been selling our biodiesel book, but of course, it goes out to December. Unfortunately, with the lack of clarity over next year, you know, you could think that if we continue to crush at these levels, maybe oil inventories will climb and something we'll have to give for next -- for the first quarter. At this point, there is not a lot of margin for independent non-integrated plants to run in the first quarter. So you know, we may see a spike of RINs later in the quarter and we might have to maybe as industry slowdown crash in the first quarter. On a carb solutions perspective, it's kind of steady, if you will. Margins are good, volumes are good, manufacturing is operating well, so we get -- we are cranking on all the cost savings. We have implemented some of the automation projects that's given us benefits to that. So I would say we should see a little bit ethanol margins are always the variable here. They are slightly on the breakeven side. So hopefully, we finish the year strong there. And then on the nutrition side, we certainly, as Monish was saying in the outlook, we've seen improvements in animal nutrition, we've seen a balance of some revenue growth, but also some one-offs that we needed to address in the human side. So I will say better than last year, slightly lower than maybe the previous quarter, and we are putting all our efforts in finishing that plant, so we can have a 2025 cleaner of all those extra costs.\nMonish Patolawala: Just a couple more for you Ben is -- can I just add a couple more?\nBen Theurer: Yes, yes.\nMonish Patolawala: For insurance proceeds that is a partial settlement right now. If you add the three segments I gave you, in the fourth quarter, there is an assumption that we will get 100% reinsurance proceeds of $135 million. So that's the other variable. And then back on nutrition, what Juan said just for disclosure, currently based on where the team is seeing, we think with M&A, it's low-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. And on an organic basis, it's low-single-digits negative growth. And so that's the other piece. I just wanted to add to what Juan said. Thank you.\nBen Theurer: And to clarify, those insurance just similar as in the third quarter that will basically then be deducted in other, correct?\nMonish Patolawala: No, these are all 100% reinsurance proceeds, Ben. So they will -- so our captive insurance has reinsurance cover. And so we expect to get $135 million as a partial settlement for the Decatur East. And this will continue into '25 and '26 as we -- yes, it's different than 3Q where the captive was paying for it. Now we are expecting reinsurance proceeds.\nBen Theurer: Okay. Perfect. That explains a lot. Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nHeather Jones: Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nJuan Luciano: Good morning, Heather.\nHeather Jones: So you guys talked -- good morning. So you all have talked a lot about the challenging cycle we're in and as far as looking to '25, but wanted to get a sense of, I mean, what are some things that could be givebacks in '25. So I was just wondering if you could quantify how much take or pay hit you guys in '24? And then the cost impact of all the unplanned downtimes that presumably as you've gotten these plants running better, you should get back that's separate from the crush curve. So I was just wondering if you could first quantify those couple of things for me.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I would say, I'm not sure I have all of them top of my head for the full year, Heather. But let me say the following. I agree with you. I think and on the take or pay, first of all, we learned our lesson. So we're going to act differently, I think as ourselves and you know maybe even the whole industry. I think also the weather in Brazil is very good. So we expect to have probably 170 million tons type of crop next year that will avoid these issues. I will say all these resets in 2025, so we still have very little exposure of our take or pay. But I don't have top of my head what was the whole thing. And then on the manufacturing side, we have issues mostly in the Q3, I would say. Some of the plans when we look at our capacity, when we were down, sometimes it was things like Paraguay because we didn't have margins, so we shut it down ourselves. And then sometimes it was Ukraine or other plants like that. We had a plant in Des Moines, Iowa that we were a little bit waiting for a permit, so we couldn't bring it back. So there are improvements there. I don't know if Monish you have some numbers in your head. I will hesitate to quantify them myself. But...\nMonish Patolawala: Yes, so I would just on take or pay, Heather, it's year-to-date, it's approximately $40 million of impact. We'll have to see what 2025 brings and what the volume and what the revised take or pay contracts look like. And then on the downtime, again, it comes down to the teams are focused on trying to get that up. The cost has gone up per cost per ton, but I would not quantify that right now. I would just wait through as we get to, there should be upside as these plants start running, but I would not quantify because it's not like a systemic down of X over months, it's puts and takes of downtime.\nHeather Jones: Right.\nJuan Luciano: One thing, Heather, that you need to consider, sorry, in the manufacturing is we implemented our automation projects in the carb solutions business first because we run a pilot and it was good return. So we extended that. Now we have finished our first pilot in the oilseeds plant in one plant in Brazil, and the results are very encouraging. Based on those results, we might do the same thing than now that we did in automation in carb solutions into the oilseeds plant. That had given us improvements in not only yields, but also energy savings and you know, ex-same losses and things like that. So there is an upside there as well as we go into -- we're going to implement all of these in -- I think we have 15 projects going into 2025 for this. So I think that you should see that as a positive for us.\nMonish Patolawala: And Heather, I would add to Juan's piece on this is everyone looks at downtime and says cycle up or cycle down. What the team is actually doing is a very good lean-based approach. So they're actually going into deep root cause, looking at what equipment caused the failure, why did it caused the failure? Is there a way to automate? Is there a way to digitize? So in the long run, I put this under the pillar of operational excellence. Our factory should continue to run better in the longer term, and we'll put in the right appropriate of CapEx needed to make sure that we can over the long-term have sustained operating leverage from our factories.\nHeather Jones: Okay. Thank you. My follow-up is just, do you have an estimate of how much reinsurance proceeds will be in '25 and '26? I think you said it will continue into '26. So just give us a sense of what those just rough numbers, what those numbers will look like?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. So I'll start with just the overall possible loss that is there. And again, this is very preliminary. The teams are still working it through. But we believe Decatur West should be approximately in the $100 million of loss and Decatur East should be in the $300 million to $400 million of loss. We've got $95 million in Q3. We expect to get $135 million, give or take in Q4. We expect that in 2025, we should be somewhere in that $50 million to $100 million range and then and the rest will work over the next. Now all of this is based on information we have right now, all of this is based on still working through with the actuaries, with the insurance companies, et cetera. And our goal is to continue working it and we'll keep you posted as we get to know more, but this is truly based on what we know as of right now.\nOperator: We now turn to Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nManav Gupta: My question specifically is to you, Monish. You have been in the seat for some time, but looking at the next 12 months to 24 months, Monish, what are your key priorities? What are you going to be most focused on for the next couple of years to make ADM a stronger company?\nMonish Patolawala: Yes. First, Manav, I'll just say, yes, I've been here slightly over 90-days and it's been a blast to be here. It's a fantastic team. I've got a chance to go see some farms, I've got a chance to go see our operations. I've got a chance to go meet the teams in the field and it's a very exciting time to be here. I would tell you on my priorities, as I think about it, as I said in my prepared remarks, my first priority is the integrity and -- of our financial statements and remediating the material weakness. The team has already done a lot of work, but there's a lot more we can do in improving our processes, our internal controls and our systems. And that's what I'm focused in with the IT team and the finance teams to make sure that we have systems that can support all the reporting and all the revised pricing et cetera for intersegment sales. So that's one item. Then I come to the second piece, which is driving cash cost and capital. As Juan mentioned and I have said, there is a lot of opportunity here to control what we control and therefore, we are doubling down on our productivity efforts. And I'm working with the teams on multiple areas that we can simplify our business, reduce our cost, take advantage of our procurement savings as we should be getting into a slightly deflationary environment, while at the same time making sure that we are having functional excellence, which is we are delivering from the center what really the businesses need. So we are following a zero-based approach in certain of our functions. We are looking at all the cost and saying, what are we doing? Do we get the value for it or not. Similarly, when it thinks about capital, you've heard about capital allocation. When you think about CapEx, it's a stage-gate model. So making sure that we are investing in areas because there are tremendous opportunities for investment available to us, but at the same time, making sure that we're getting a return and we're going to follow a stage-gate approach, which means we'll fund you a little bit, we'll see what the return looks like at that point in time. If you hit the milestones, you get the next funding, otherwise, the money goes to somebody else. So create some internal tension to make sure that everyone is fighting for the last dollar of CapEx that's available. Then I go into digital and I think there's tremendous opportunity for you. The Kristy and team who's our CIO has done a really nice job. The company has done a nice job of improving the infrastructure that we have. We still have a long way to go in that, but I feel there's also a chance here to accelerate some of the ability to use data and data analytics to drive business outcomes. So that's another priority of mine. And then I would tell you back to portfolio. The company has always said they will look at portfolio. I've said that too in my prepared remarks in my three-month plus year, I've seen there are opportunities here that we are working on to make sure we simplify our portfolio. And I look at it from a simple lens of do I have a market and do I have a right to win first. And if I do, am I the rightful owner of that asset and what return are we getting. And Juan and I have spent quite some time together on talking about this. He has always been open to portfolio, and we are going to continue working on that. So Manav, I don't know if I answered your question, long answer to your short question, but lot of priorities. And then I'll end with where I started, which is back to the basics. You got to drive cost, cash and capital in this environment where we know that the commodity cycle may not be our best friend. So self-help is truly our best friend and that's what the teams are working on. So hopefully answered your question.\nManav Gupta: No, you absolutely did. My very quick follow-up and this is more on the policy side. We saw some news that there are some changes to China export taxes as it relates to UCO and maybe Chinese UCO will make its way less to the global markets. There's a little bit of possibility that President Trump might impose some tariffs on anyways UCO coming into the U.S. So I'm just trying to understand from the perspective of ADM, if China exports less Yuko to the global markets, how does -- how can that help ADM?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, thank you. Well, you see Manav what happened when the flood of UCO came into the U.S., so then basically soybean oil or canola oil lost percentage, it lost share as a percentage of feedstocks, if you will. And there were a lot of concerns on the origin of some of these UCO. And there have been a lot of questions by people about making sure we verify that origin, especially when you start seeing big palm oil producing countries being big exporters of UCO also. So I think part of that is to make sure that whoever is playing here is playing with the right rules. So I don't know about the regulation. There are a lot of speculation at this point in time about regulations. We just want a level-playing field. We just want to work on products that are real what they say they are. And I think that's what we aim for is transparency in the rules. Then we play by the rules.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSteven Haynes: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just coming back to the cost side of things. I think your SG&A is up quite a bit this year and accelerating a bit, maybe more than kind of what would be implied by normal inflation. So I guess when we're thinking about that kind of ramp-up this year, what are some of the key drivers there? And then how are we supposed to think about that going into next year pairing with your comments about you know more focus on controlling cost. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: So I'll just start with answering the question on what's driving the increase in SG&A, there are couple of drivers here. One is the higher litigation costs that we have in defending the or sorry, the higher litigation costs that we have with the material weakness that we have. So that's number one. Number two is the company has invested in digital transformation over the last few years and that's the cost that is increasing there to support the transformation of our ERPs. Number three is we got higher interest cost that we have, which is also reported -- sorry, you were just asking SG&A, not corporate. So those are my two big drivers that drive it, which is GT and then some litigation costs. We also have normal merit increase that goes into that, but that's partially offset by the lower incentive compensation that as we see the results of the company right now, you're going to see lower. So when you look at all of that back to your question also what are we going to do about all of this, as I said, a couple of things is, we need to continue investing in digital transformation as we go through that. Secondly, I would tell you that as we work through some of the zero-based budgeting exercises that we have here, we need to make sure that where there is opportunities, there is value being added for those activities, that's what we are working on. And then the third piece that is an add to the cost, which is M&A, so as we have bought four companies that closed in 2024, you get added cost that of course comes through into SG&A, but that's also where we have to keep looking at and saying making sure the synergies for those M&As are coming through too. So I would say in the long-run, when I look at this, this is where we clearly have an opportunity to continue driving our focus on cost. And I would do cost in two places. One is cost in SG&A. The second cost is our manufacturing cost, which Juan has already talked about and I've talked about where we should be able to keep driving efficiencies, which should help us reduce cost.\nSteven Haynes: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Tami Zakaria with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. My question is on crush volumes. I think I saw on your slide you expect high single-digit percent type volume growth in the fourth quarter. So I'm just curious, is that a good starting point for next year barring any policy developments or can you share any initial thoughts on how you're thinking about volumes?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I would say, as you said, if you take the regulatory uncertainty out and what's going to happen with people adjusting their crush because of their blender tax credit to producer tax credit issue, whenever that's going to be solved, I think that, that level that we are disclosing is probably a reasonable level on normal conditions, if you will, yes. And that basically is just the addition of Spiritwood -- is the addition of Spiritwood that is running at full capacity basically, almost full capacity.\nTami Zakaria: Understood. That's helpful. And then just following up on that tariff question from earlier, are you preparing for any either positive or negative impacts should the incoming new administration slap tariffs on foreign imports maybe starting in January, do you see any immediate opportunities or even risks to your business when initial tariffs go into effect?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, of course, our business is running a lot of scenario planning for what could happen. Normally, what we see in these circumstances is the trade flows adjust. At the end of the day, you continue to have certain demand in the world, is just satisfied in a different way. So that's where in those situations is where the footprint, the global footprint and the team of ADM normally shines because it allows us with a lot of agility to repurpose those trade flows to take advantage of the conditions. So we are remaining agile, and again doing a lot of scenario planning to be ready.\nTami Zakaria: Understood. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: You're welcome.\nOperator: We now turn to Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSalvator Tiano: Yes, thank you very much. You did make a comment early in the call about China increasing production of certain commodities that is impacting trade. And I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about that, what are these commodities you're talking about, and whether this is something that's more cyclical like higher crop production because of favorable weather or something more structural certainly more policy, I guess driven that could impact global trade in the longer-term?\nJuan Luciano: Yes, I think that China has shown this year that they wanted to encourage or incentivate their local corn production. And as such, they have reduced their -- they have to reduce their imports of corn. I think in -- that's probably what I was referring to, their imports of corn this year are going to be lower. I think in terms of soybeans, the situation is slightly different. I think they are preparing for the eventuality of having to or having to have, you know, tariffs or whatever. So they've been buying and they've been refreshing their reserves. So I think that in that sense the amount that they imported has been about the same. I would say it was more the corn comment.\nSalvator Tiano: Okay, perfect. And just want to follow-up a little bit on to ask about the depreciation in the Brazilian reis recently. And I'm just wondering what impact could this have most of your bottom line in Q4, but especially in 2025, given that's now under -- it's now over six.\nJuan Luciano: I think, Salvador, the biggest impact that happened with devaluations in Latin America is how they impact farmer selling. You see it in Argentina now that the currency and/or the spread with the you know the two exchange rates is just 10%, the farmer is a more normal seller, if you will, when they need cash and more a steady seller. In Brazil, now with the devaluation, the farmer has been more reluctant seller, if you will. So I would say when you look at Latin America, that's probably what impacts us the most is the ability of the farmer to be pressed to be a commercializer of grain.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'll now hand back to Megan Britt for any final remarks.\nMegan Britt: Thank you so much for joining the call today and for your interest in ADM. Please feel free to follow-up directly with me if you have any additional questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan. Hello and welcome to all who have joined the call. We sincerely appreciate your patience as we work expeditiously to amend the company's fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2024. We are pleased to now be able to share more context about our 2024 year-to-date financial results and our outlook. Even that we are holding this call later than usual, we're also in a position to provide qualitative color on how the fourth quarter is progressing. To start, let's recap our financial results for the company. ADM reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 and a total segment operating profit of $1 billion. This brings adjusted earnings per share to $3.61 and our total segment operating profit to $3.2 billion year-to-date for 2024. Our trailing four-quarter adjusted ROIC was 8.8%. Although we made progress on several important initiatives in 2024, this results are not consistent with the high bar that we have set for our team. While we have seen a decline in our total segment operating profit and a decline in operating cash flow before working capital changes, due to lower net earnings relative to the prior year period, discipline management of our balance sheet continues to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. In total, we have returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders with $744 million in the form of dividends and $2.3 billion in share repurchases year-to-date in 2024. Next slide, please. Entering 2024, we laid out key priorities for value creation based on the year we saw ahead of us. And as we moved into the fourth quarter, it's clear that certain expectations have not all play out as anticipated. The global commodity landscape has continued to shift. Stronger-than-expected supply has driven commodity prices down further than anticipated. Canola crash margins have been negatively impacted by regulatory uncertainty and higher seed prices. In addition, China has begun to increase local commodity production and has had a slower pace of demand recovery, negatively impacting the trade of certain commodities and uptake of animal nutrition solutions. We're also seeing the trailing effects of inflation in part of our business. Some new nutrition projects have been delayed as some customers look for opportunities to manage costs by simplifying their consumer offerings. We have also seen some softness in demand in other end markets such as pet treats and energy drinks where consumers are prioritizing their discretionary spending. The global regulatory environment has led to additional uncertainties. Programs such as EUDR and the U.S. producers tax credit are still not fully in place, which has left various stakeholders in the Ag supply-chain without the confidence of a clear path forward. Beyond these external factors creating downward pressure, we're also managing through a balance of both positive and challenging results across our own operational environment. In carbohydrate solutions, we've been able to improve production throughout the network, in part due to advancements in automation and digitization at the plant level, as well as by finding synergies across our milling network. We've seen similar improvements in our crush facilities in LatAm and EMEA, but this has been offset today by the fact that opportunities previously identified in some of our U.S. plants have been taking longer-than-expected to be completed. However, in October, we began to see improvements in unplanned downtime in our U.S. facilities. Nutrition has continued to manage through the downtime of our Decatur East facility, where our expected ramp up has been delayed from the end of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025 as safe restoration of operations is a top priority. And while the integration of our most recent Flavor acquisitions has driven positive results, we have experienced demand fulfillment issues due to the complexity of other integration efforts. We believe that our business is well-positioned to grow alongside enduring global trends such as the expansion of functional food and beverage alternatives, the replacement of petroleum-based products across multiple industries and the broader opportunity associated with decarbonization. As we look at the near-term in 2025, however, we anticipate that we could still be managing through a challenging cycle, and we have already begun taking necessary productivity actions with a clear focus on cost and cash management. This slide highlights several of the areas we have already taken action on in 2024, along with additional actions we are aggressively driving at the end of the year. As we manage through the current cycle, we've seen success in delivering expansion across strategic initiatives such as regen ag, BioSolutions and destination marketing, which achieved record volume handled in October, supporting supply and demand needs through increasing capacity. This is example in our Spiritwood facility, which has achieved near full run-rates in the month of October. And in ramping up the drive for execution excellence program, which has already begun to deliver toward our cost-saving goals. Moving forward, as we expand our focus on procurement and execution excellence, we believe that we can double this program's target cost savings over the next few years. In addition, the automation and digitization efforts that have already achieved millions in cost savings are being scoped and accelerated across the other plants in our footprint. Turning to Nutrition's recovery efforts. To-date we have strengthened our operational leadership, driven simplification and optimization opportunities and continued to expand our pipeline and win rates in part of the portfolio such as flavors. These efforts are now being supplemented to increase the pace of recovery. We have placed additional focus on demand generation, supply-chain improvement and rightsizing our production to better flex to the needs of the dynamic demand environment. And finally, from a strategic capital allocation perspective, we have already accelerated our return of cash to shareholders this year in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Going forward, we're being extremely prudent on focusing our attention on cash generation opportunities, while considering specific portfolio optimization efforts to simplify operations, enhance our focus and drive an improvement in ROIC. Along with all these actions, Monish joining as CFO has already brought new perspectives to the team. We are using his experience to help identify and accelerate paths for continuous recovery. With this, let me pass to Monish for a more detailed financial review. Monish? Yes. Thank you, Andrew. As you said, board crash rallied steadily from the lows in Q3, but has come under pressure in November. And it's basically a combination of things. First of all, demand for the products have been very good. Demand for meal is good, demand for oil around the world is good. But you see during November, we have the Argentine farmers started to sell again. So we've seen higher crush rates in Argentina. There are high crush rates in Brazil and NOPA here in North America, all our plants have been running well, so we have high crush in October. When you combine that with the regulatory uncertainty now we have in the oil side, that has created the problems that we have. The U.S. is exporting oil, the U.S. is exporting mill, but there is more pressure in the system with more crush being put and less regulatory clarity. So that's why overall message, Andrew, is as we look forward here, we think that given the soft markets and the regulatory uncertainty, our focus in ADM is on the things that we can control on the double down on productivity, looking at all our efforts in trying to control cost and cash and certainly portfolio management. So that's kind of our priority for the year. The markets remain robust. Soybean meal is the most competitive feed out there. So demand is strong and oil is needed for the biofuels market and oil is needed for human consumption. So I think that when we clear the regulatory environment or regulatory uncertainty, if you will, I think you're going to see things normalizing a bit. Yes. I think it's important never to lose an opportunity to get yourself extra feet. So we are taking this decline in margins as an opportunity to review everything from ADM and accelerate all the decisions that were already ongoing. So I will, you know it's too early in the year. There are too many unknowns, Andrew, to especially on the regulatory front to make a forecast for the year. But we know that focusing on the things we can control continue to drive cash flows, that's an important thing for our shareholders and that will improve returns. Yes, thank you, Tom, for the question. Listen, I think I will take it by pieces. If you take human nutrition, you have to separate. We have a big issue with the plant that is down. That plant is a significant cost. It was down for a full-year, now it's going to be down for the first quarter. And so that's an issue that is a little bit of extraordinary that we're fixing, and we thank all the engineers and everybody working expeditiously to bring it back safe. On the rest of the business is the flavors business and the health and wellness business, we continue to see opportunities. We've seen in the positive side, if you will, we've seen growth of flavors -- revenue flavors in Europe of about 7% like-for-like, so organic growth year-to-date. We have seen 5% in North America. These are not the growth rate that we were expected when we started the year because there has been some categories like energy drinks where although still growing, is growing at less -- at lower rates than we expected at the beginning of the year and our customers have expected at the beginning of the year. Some launches has been postponed, but still is a robust category and we still see growth. But as you said, we are adjusting a little bit our supply-chain to make sure we match the new realities. When you look at the other piece of human nutrition, which is health and wellness, the probiotics part, which is the part there that is the future, it is the growth part has grown so far 14% year-over-year on a revenue side, and even higher than that in operating profit side. So I think that there are good signs, but we continue to flex this. This is a year in which, as you understand, nutrition is not where we want them to be, and we are working hard to fix it. But there are on the customer side, there are positive signs that makes us believe that when we put some of these supply issues behind, we're going to see the results coming to the P&L in a bigger way. Yes. Thank you, Ben. So let me give you the puts and takes for the quarter and you can build it from there. I think in -- if you think about the grain business ag services, of course, this is the quarter in which the volumes come to North America for exports. And we see good volumes. China is buying for Q4, beans, Europe is buying corn for Q1. But we have -- although we have good volumes, we have not seen the margin expansion that maybe we have forecasted a couple of quarters or a couple of months ago. River logistics are good for December. We will have to monitor the weather for Q1, but so far so good. And calories in the market should help our interior assets. On a global trade perspective, volumes are strong and lower commodity prices are supporting feeding animals globally. So destination marketing margins are holding. On the crush side, I described before the decline in crush margins, you know, a lot of uncertainty about biofuels policy, of course. This margin compression could create timing depending on where prices are at the end of the year, we could see positive timing. So we will not be able to call that until we see the end of December. We have been selling our biodiesel book, but of course, it goes out to December. Unfortunately, with the lack of clarity over next year, you know, you could think that if we continue to crush at these levels, maybe oil inventories will climb and something we'll have to give for next -- for the first quarter. At this point, there is not a lot of margin for independent non-integrated plants to run in the first quarter. So you know, we may see a spike of RINs later in the quarter and we might have to maybe as industry slowdown crash in the first quarter. On a carb solutions perspective, it's kind of steady, if you will. Margins are good, volumes are good, manufacturing is operating well, so we get -- we are cranking on all the cost savings. We have implemented some of the automation projects that's given us benefits to that. So I would say we should see a little bit ethanol margins are always the variable here. They are slightly on the breakeven side. So hopefully, we finish the year strong there. And then on the nutrition side, we certainly, as Monish was saying in the outlook, we've seen improvements in animal nutrition, we've seen a balance of some revenue growth, but also some one-offs that we needed to address in the human side. So I will say better than last year, slightly lower than maybe the previous quarter, and we are putting all our efforts in finishing that plant, so we can have a 2025 cleaner of all those extra costs. Good morning, Heather. Yes, I would say, I'm not sure I have all of them top of my head for the full year, Heather. But let me say the following. I agree with you. I think and on the take or pay, first of all, we learned our lesson. So we're going to act differently, I think as ourselves and you know maybe even the whole industry. I think also the weather in Brazil is very good. So we expect to have probably 170 million tons type of crop next year that will avoid these issues. I will say all these resets in 2025, so we still have very little exposure of our take or pay. But I don't have top of my head what was the whole thing. And then on the manufacturing side, we have issues mostly in the Q3, I would say. Some of the plans when we look at our capacity, when we were down, sometimes it was things like Paraguay because we didn't have margins, so we shut it down ourselves. And then sometimes it was Ukraine or other plants like that. We had a plant in Des Moines, Iowa that we were a little bit waiting for a permit, so we couldn't bring it back. So there are improvements there. I don't know if Monish you have some numbers in your head. I will hesitate to quantify them myself. But... One thing, Heather, that you need to consider, sorry, in the manufacturing is we implemented our automation projects in the carb solutions business first because we run a pilot and it was good return. So we extended that. Now we have finished our first pilot in the oilseeds plant in one plant in Brazil, and the results are very encouraging. Based on those results, we might do the same thing than now that we did in automation in carb solutions into the oilseeds plant. That had given us improvements in not only yields, but also energy savings and you know, ex-same losses and things like that. So there is an upside there as well as we go into -- we're going to implement all of these in -- I think we have 15 projects going into 2025 for this. So I think that you should see that as a positive for us. Yes, thank you. Well, you see Manav what happened when the flood of UCO came into the U.S., so then basically soybean oil or canola oil lost percentage, it lost share as a percentage of feedstocks, if you will. And there were a lot of concerns on the origin of some of these UCO. And there have been a lot of questions by people about making sure we verify that origin, especially when you start seeing big palm oil producing countries being big exporters of UCO also. So I think part of that is to make sure that whoever is playing here is playing with the right rules. So I don't know about the regulation. There are a lot of speculation at this point in time about regulations. We just want a level-playing field. We just want to work on products that are real what they say they are. And I think that's what we aim for is transparency in the rules. Then we play by the rules. So I'll just start with answering the question on what's driving the increase in SG&A, there are couple of drivers here. One is the higher litigation costs that we have in defending the or sorry, the higher litigation costs that we have with the material weakness that we have. So that's number one. Number two is the company has invested in digital transformation over the last few years and that's the cost that is increasing there to support the transformation of our ERPs. Number three is we got higher interest cost that we have, which is also reported -- sorry, you were just asking SG&A, not corporate. So those are my two big drivers that drive it, which is GT and then some litigation costs. We also have normal merit increase that goes into that, but that's partially offset by the lower incentive compensation that as we see the results of the company right now, you're going to see lower. So when you look at all of that back to your question also what are we going to do about all of this, as I said, a couple of things is, we need to continue investing in digital transformation as we go through that. Secondly, I would tell you that as we work through some of the zero-based budgeting exercises that we have here, we need to make sure that where there is opportunities, there is value being added for those activities, that's what we are working on. And then the third piece that is an add to the cost, which is M&A, so as we have bought four companies that closed in 2024, you get added cost that of course comes through into SG&A, but that's also where we have to keep looking at and saying making sure the synergies for those M&As are coming through too. So I would say in the long-run, when I look at this, this is where we clearly have an opportunity to continue driving our focus on cost. And I would do cost in two places. One is cost in SG&A. The second cost is our manufacturing cost, which Juan has already talked about and I've talked about where we should be able to keep driving efficiencies, which should help us reduce cost. Yes, I would say, as you said, if you take the regulatory uncertainty out and what's going to happen with people adjusting their crush because of their blender tax credit to producer tax credit issue, whenever that's going to be solved, I think that, that level that we are disclosing is probably a reasonable level on normal conditions, if you will, yes. And that basically is just the addition of Spiritwood -- is the addition of Spiritwood that is running at full capacity basically, almost full capacity. Yes, of course, our business is running a lot of scenario planning for what could happen. Normally, what we see in these circumstances is the trade flows adjust. At the end of the day, you continue to have certain demand in the world, is just satisfied in a different way. So that's where in those situations is where the footprint, the global footprint and the team of ADM normally shines because it allows us with a lot of agility to repurpose those trade flows to take advantage of the conditions. So we are remaining agile, and again doing a lot of scenario planning to be ready. You're welcome. Yes, I think that China has shown this year that they wanted to encourage or incentivate their local corn production. And as such, they have reduced their -- they have to reduce their imports of corn. I think in -- that's probably what I was referring to, their imports of corn this year are going to be lower. I think in terms of soybeans, the situation is slightly different. I think they are preparing for the eventuality of having to or having to have, you know, tariffs or whatever. So they've been buying and they've been refreshing their reserves. So I think that in that sense the amount that they imported has been about the same. I would say it was more the corn comment. I think, Salvador, the biggest impact that happened with devaluations in Latin America is how they impact farmer selling. You see it in Argentina now that the currency and/or the spread with the you know the two exchange rates is just 10%, the farmer is a more normal seller, if you will, when they need cash and more a steady seller. In Brazil, now with the devaluation, the farmer has been more reluctant seller, if you will. So I would say when you look at Latin America, that's probably what impacts us the most is the ability of the farmer to be pressed to be a commercializer of grain."

            "content": "Thank you, Juan. First, I would like to take a moment to say how excited I am to be joining the ADM team at such an important point in the company's trajectory. While I've only been on the job for a few months, I have enjoyed the opportunity to personally engage with our teams and learn the company. I want to thank all my ADM colleagues for their warm welcome. Turning to Slide 6. On a year-to-date basis, AS&O segment operating profit of $1.8 billion was 42% lower versus the prior year period as ample supplies out of South America have driven lower commodity prices and margins across the segment. Ag services sub-segment operating profit of $461 was 52% lower versus the prior year, driven by lower South American origination margins and volumes, in part due to industry take-or-pay contracts. The stabilization of trade flows has also led to fewer opportunities in our global trade business, leading to lower results. Crushing sub-segment operating profit of $632 million was 30% lower versus the prior year period. Slower farmer selling and lower crush rates in Argentina, coupled with solid demand has supported soy crush margins leading to a year-to-date executed soy crush margin of approximately $50 per metric ton, which is lower, compared to the prior year. While year-to-date executed canola crush margins are lower by approximately $15 per ton, compared to the prior year, margins have moderated significantly in the second-half of the year so far, as higher seed prices and regulatory uncertainty drove lower margins. There were net negative timing impacts of approximately $120 million year-over-year. In the refined products and other sub segment, increased pre-treatment capacity at renewable diesel facilities and higher imports of used cooking oil has negatively impacted both refining and biodiesel margins, leading to sub-segment operating profit that was 58% lower versus the prior year. There were net negative timing impacts of approximately $360 million year-over-year. As we look forward, we anticipate AS&O fourth quarter results to be lower than the prior year quarter. The seasonal shift to our North American weighted footprint and strong North American crop should be supportive of volumes. But recent elevation margins are below the levels we expected when we put our guidance in place in November. In crushing, the ramp-up of our Spiritwood facility is expected to support high-single-digit volume improvement. However, we expect lower results due to lower soya and canola crush margins versus the prior year. The addition of new pre-treatment capacity has continued to weigh on margins within the RPO business and on the food oil side, margins for free-to-sell opportunities have been under pressure, due to increased competition. Based on the information available today, we also anticipate 100% reinsurance proceeds of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter related to both Decatur West and East. We continue to monitor the impact of uncertainty related to regulation and trade flows on the operating environment as we look forward to the end of the year. Year-to-date, carbohydrate solutions segment operating profit of $1.1 billion in the year-to-date period was roughly in line with the prior year as lower margins in the EMEA region and ethanol were mostly offset by strong volumes and improved manufacturing costs. As we look forward, a strong North American corn supply and robust export demand is export expected to be supportive of VCP. However, North American ethanol production continues to outpace demand, driving lower margins. We expect to see solid demand and margins in North American starches and sweeteners as we finish the year. Wheat milling margins are expected to moderate from elevated prior-year levels. Based on information available today, we also anticipate 100% reinsured insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter related to both Decatur East and West incident of approximately $35 million. Taken together, we anticipate the carbohydrate solutions fourth quarter results to be in line with the prior year period. Year-to-date, revenues from nutrition were $5.6 billion, up 2%, compared to the prior year. On an organic basis, segment revenue was down 3%. Human nutrition was flat organically as headwinds related to Decatur East and texturants pricing offset growth in flavors and health and wellness. Animal nutrition revenue declined 5%, driven by unfavorable mix, negative currency impacts in Brazil and low volumes due to demand fulfillment challenges. Year-to-date nutrition sub-segment operating profit of $298 million was 32% lower versus the prior year. Human nutrition results of $265 million were 40% lower, compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by unplanned downtime at Decatur East. Animal nutrition results of $33 million were slightly higher, compared to the prior year, due to an improvement in margins. As we finish the year, we expect continued weak consumer demand, lower texturants prices and ongoing operational challenges to be a headwind. And as Juan previously mentioned, we now anticipate the start-up of our Decatur East facility to be delayed until the first quarter of 2025. We expect the impact of prolonged downtime at Decatur East to be partially offset by 100% reinsurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of approximately $50 million based on the information available today. We expect animal nutrition results in the fourth quarter to be better than the prior year with tailwinds from our turnaround efforts and as we continue to work through operational challenges in pet solutions. Taken together, we expect nutrition results for the fourth quarter likely lower than the third quarter of 2024, but to be higher than the prior year, which had negative impact of approximately $64 million in non-recurring items. Please turn to slide seven. Year-to-date in 2024 the company has generated cash flow from operations before working capital of approximately $2.3 billion, down relative to the same period last year, due to lower segment operating profit. Despite the decline, solid cash generation has supported our ability to invest in our business and return excess cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, the company has returned $3.1 billion in cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Allocated $1.1 billion to capital expenditures and nearly $1 billion to M&A announced in 2023 and completed in January 2024. Our capital structure continues to provide the financial flexibility to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. We continue to see opportunities to drive enhanced cash generation through operating improvements both in our facilities and through better management of working capital. We believe investing in organic opportunities gives us the best return. While we will always look at opportunistic M&A as a way to enhance return, it is essential that we prioritize maximizing returns from the assets that we have already acquired and also ensuring that we are the best owners of all our assets. Now let's transition to a discussion of guidance for 2024 on slide eight. In early November, we announced that we lowered our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.50 per share to $5 per share. The lowering of our guide takes into account our year-to-date results and headwinds from slow market demand and internal operational challenges. Additionally, we now anticipate our corporate cost to be within the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and our corporate net interest expense to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion. We are also increasing our effective tax-rate guidance to the range of 20% to 22%, due to the non-deductible impairment of Wilmar taken in the third quarter. Our expectations for our leverage ratio and D&A are unchanged. Let's turn to slide nine to close the call with a reflection on the key priorities that we are driving with our team to deliver improvement and enhance return. First, my top priority is ensuring integrity and accuracy in our internal controls and financial reporting. I echo Juan's earlier statement and add my particular thanks for the extraordinary efforts of our team to amend and file the restated financials for fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2024. We are continuing to focus on implementing enhancements to our internal controls to remediate the previously identified material weakness and are taking action to enhance the integrity and accuracy within internal controls and financial reporting related to intersegment sales. Among other things, the design and documentation of the execution of pricing and measurement and reporting controls for segment disclosure purposes and projected financial information used in impairment analysis have been enhanced and the testing of these controls will continue throughout the balance of the year. Further, training for relevant personnel on the measurement of intersegment sales and application of relevant accounting guidance to intersegment sales has been provided and remains ongoing. In the broader category of improving focus and execution, the team will remain adaptable and focus on items within our control. On the cost side, we are optimizing our cost structure and enhancing operational resilience initiatives. In this vein, we have the opportunity to create a more cohesive digital strategy. Today, we have invested in numerous efforts to improve our systems and enable a more digital footing for our business. However, we have the opportunity to connect these efforts to accelerate outcomes around how we serve our customers, operate our assets and run the enterprise, while also delivering structural cost improvement. Similarly, we have room in our portfolio and broader asset network to optimize through targeted divestitures or rationalization and we are evaluating numerous actions that we could take to improve our footprint performance and generate cash. We will also maintain a sharp focus on working capital management to further strengthen our cash position. Lastly, we'll remain disciplined in capital allocation, seeking opportunities to drive ROIC and enhance returns. I see maintaining our capital discipline as essential to value creation. We will work to ensure that we maintain a healthy balance sheet that continues to create strong cash flow and that we rigor investment opportunities appropriately by applying a stage-gated model to ensure that we are achieving key milestones and meeting our return objectives to continue to invest. In closing, I want to take a moment to thank our ADM colleagues for their hard work and dedication this quarter. I am optimistic that today we can successfully tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy and focus on delivering value for our shareholders. With that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question. Andrew, I echo what Juan just said, it's back to the basics of cash cost and capital. And that's what we are focused on right now. Lot of opportunities head-down, get 2024 closed and we'll come back when we're ready to discuss 2025. But we know the environment is going to be soft and that's why the teams are controlling what they control. Just a couple more for you Ben is -- can I just add a couple more? For insurance proceeds that is a partial settlement right now. If you add the three segments I gave you, in the fourth quarter, there is an assumption that we will get 100% reinsurance proceeds of $135 million. So that's the other variable. And then back on nutrition, what Juan said just for disclosure, currently based on where the team is seeing, we think with M&A, it's low-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. And on an organic basis, it's low-single-digits negative growth. And so that's the other piece. I just wanted to add to what Juan said. Thank you. No, these are all 100% reinsurance proceeds, Ben. So they will -- so our captive insurance has reinsurance cover. And so we expect to get $135 million as a partial settlement for the Decatur East. And this will continue into '25 and '26 as we -- yes, it's different than 3Q where the captive was paying for it. Now we are expecting reinsurance proceeds. Yes, so I would just on take or pay, Heather, it's year-to-date, it's approximately $40 million of impact. We'll have to see what 2025 brings and what the volume and what the revised take or pay contracts look like. And then on the downtime, again, it comes down to the teams are focused on trying to get that up. The cost has gone up per cost per ton, but I would not quantify that right now. I would just wait through as we get to, there should be upside as these plants start running, but I would not quantify because it's not like a systemic down of X over months, it's puts and takes of downtime. And Heather, I would add to Juan's piece on this is everyone looks at downtime and says cycle up or cycle down. What the team is actually doing is a very good lean-based approach. So they're actually going into deep root cause, looking at what equipment caused the failure, why did it caused the failure? Is there a way to automate? Is there a way to digitize? So in the long run, I put this under the pillar of operational excellence. Our factory should continue to run better in the longer term, and we'll put in the right appropriate of CapEx needed to make sure that we can over the long-term have sustained operating leverage from our factories. Yes. So I'll start with just the overall possible loss that is there. And again, this is very preliminary. The teams are still working it through. But we believe Decatur West should be approximately in the $100 million of loss and Decatur East should be in the $300 million to $400 million of loss. We've got $95 million in Q3. We expect to get $135 million, give or take in Q4. We expect that in 2025, we should be somewhere in that $50 million to $100 million range and then and the rest will work over the next. Now all of this is based on information we have right now, all of this is based on still working through with the actuaries, with the insurance companies, et cetera. And our goal is to continue working it and we'll keep you posted as we get to know more, but this is truly based on what we know as of right now. Yes. First, Manav, I'll just say, yes, I've been here slightly over 90-days and it's been a blast to be here. It's a fantastic team. I've got a chance to go see some farms, I've got a chance to go see our operations. I've got a chance to go meet the teams in the field and it's a very exciting time to be here. I would tell you on my priorities, as I think about it, as I said in my prepared remarks, my first priority is the integrity and -- of our financial statements and remediating the material weakness. The team has already done a lot of work, but there's a lot more we can do in improving our processes, our internal controls and our systems. And that's what I'm focused in with the IT team and the finance teams to make sure that we have systems that can support all the reporting and all the revised pricing et cetera for intersegment sales. So that's one item. Then I come to the second piece, which is driving cash cost and capital. As Juan mentioned and I have said, there is a lot of opportunity here to control what we control and therefore, we are doubling down on our productivity efforts. And I'm working with the teams on multiple areas that we can simplify our business, reduce our cost, take advantage of our procurement savings as we should be getting into a slightly deflationary environment, while at the same time making sure that we are having functional excellence, which is we are delivering from the center what really the businesses need. So we are following a zero-based approach in certain of our functions. We are looking at all the cost and saying, what are we doing? Do we get the value for it or not. Similarly, when it thinks about capital, you've heard about capital allocation. When you think about CapEx, it's a stage-gate model. So making sure that we are investing in areas because there are tremendous opportunities for investment available to us, but at the same time, making sure that we're getting a return and we're going to follow a stage-gate approach, which means we'll fund you a little bit, we'll see what the return looks like at that point in time. If you hit the milestones, you get the next funding, otherwise, the money goes to somebody else. So create some internal tension to make sure that everyone is fighting for the last dollar of CapEx that's available. Then I go into digital and I think there's tremendous opportunity for you. The Kristy and team who's our CIO has done a really nice job. The company has done a nice job of improving the infrastructure that we have. We still have a long way to go in that, but I feel there's also a chance here to accelerate some of the ability to use data and data analytics to drive business outcomes. So that's another priority of mine. And then I would tell you back to portfolio. The company has always said they will look at portfolio. I've said that too in my prepared remarks in my three-month plus year, I've seen there are opportunities here that we are working on to make sure we simplify our portfolio. And I look at it from a simple lens of do I have a market and do I have a right to win first. And if I do, am I the rightful owner of that asset and what return are we getting. And Juan and I have spent quite some time together on talking about this. He has always been open to portfolio, and we are going to continue working on that. So Manav, I don't know if I answered your question, long answer to your short question, but lot of priorities. And then I'll end with where I started, which is back to the basics. You got to drive cost, cash and capital in this environment where we know that the commodity cycle may not be our best friend. So self-help is truly our best friend and that's what the teams are working on. So hopefully answered your question."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\nMegan Britt: Thank you, Eliot. Hello and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Webcast for ADM. Starring to tomorrow a replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website. Please turn to slide 2. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance, and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risk and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on filed with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. On today\u2019s webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano will discuss our second quarter results and share recent accomplishment on our strategic priority. Our Chief Financial Officer, Ismael Roig will review segment level performance and provide an update on our cash generation and capital allocation action. Juan will have some closing remarks and then he and Ismael will take your questions. Please turn to slide 4. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Megan and good morning to all of who have joined for today\u2019s call. Today, ADM report its second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1 billion. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.7%. We delivered a strong cash flow from operations before working capital at $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, this equates to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.49 and an adjusted segment operating profit of $2.3 billion. Our team delivered solid results in challenging market conditions, highlighting the efforts of our teams across the business to manage through the commodity down cycle while putting our nutrition business on a path to recovery. Additionally, we saw signs of improving fundamentals within crush and ethanol later in the quarter, positioning us for a strong second half. We're also flexing our capital allocation strategy to return cash to shareholders, completing our planned share repurchases for the quarter and delivering our 370th consecutive quarterly dividend. Next slide, please. Let's start by reviewing the top-line results of our business units alongside our efforts to manage the cycle through productivity and innovation. Our service analysis results are significantly lower than the record results of prior years due to the ongoing rebalancing of the supply and demand environment and overall lower farmer selling. In anticipation of this year's challenges, we focus on driving stronger production volumes and actively leveraging our footprint to match supply to demand around the globe. We've also focused on differentiation opportunities, extending margins and growing volumes by more than 20% year-over-year in areas like destination marketing, achieving our targeted run rate in our Green Bison JV for renewable green diesel feedstocks, and bringing new solutions to our customers through innovations such as our recent EUDR-compliant fully traceable soybean program and the expansion of our regenerative agriculture partnerships and acreage. These regenec programs highlight our leadership in this space. ABM was named the finalist in Fast Company's world changing ideas in May. And just last week we released our second annual regenec report detailing the data backed results we are achieving across our global operations. Carbohydrate Solutions have continued the solid performance trajectory driven by strong margins for sweeteners, starches, and flour with higher volumes year-over-year. Ethanol margins also strengthened as industry production tried to keep pace with robust export and domestic demand. Along with this performance, we are continuing to drive innovation-based growth through the sustainability centered evolution of the business. We have delivered 7% year-to-date volume expansion across our BioSolutions platform, increased starch capacity in our Marshall, Minnesota facility to meet growing demand from food, beverage, and industrial customers, and in a milestone for our strategic partnership, Solugen recently broke ground on a 500,000 square foot biomanufacturing facility that will use ADM source dextrose for applications in water treatment, agriculture, energy, and home and personal care. Within our productivity agenda, the drive for execution excellence is continuing to deliver simplification and cost-saving opportunities across the enterprise. In Q2, we advance hundreds of projects that put us clearly on the path to the plan $500 million in cost reduction over the next two years. We are accelerating these efforts and expect to see a significant portion of these savings by the end of 2024. Our focus on returning nutrition to its growth trajectory is also taking hold, and we are seeing sequential top-line improvement as compared to our previous two quarters. While we are experiencing some downward pressure with texture and some protein demand, we draw strong growth in health and wellness sales, along with flavor sales growth, and excellent contributions from our recent acquisitions. In our targeted areas of focus, we are continuing to make progress. We continue to improve demand fulfillment for Flavors in our EMEA region, following the implementation of one ADM. We're optimizing cost across the Animal Nutrition portfolio, building the foundation to drive continued sequential improvement across the core of the segment. The use of our refined M&A playbook with our recent flavor acquisitions has proven to be an important accelerator to integration and the ongoing growth of our leading global Flavors business. And our innovation agenda is paying off, driving Human Nutrition revenues up 6% year-to-date, driven by flavors and our science-backed health and wellness portfolio. Our capital allocation efforts continued through the second quarter as we completed our planned shared repurchases and announced our most recent dividend. We have already returned $2.8 billion of capital to shareholders to date. The second quarter marked an important point in our efforts to manage through the market realities of 2024 and deliver on our priorities. Across all three businesses, we are evolving to drive new pockets of growth in the near term while positioning ADM to take full advantage of macro trends of sustainability, health and well-being, and food security in the longer term. As we continue to drive operational excellence and make progress on our key priorities, we have confidence in our full year expectations despite uncertainties in the external environment. Before I hand over to Ismael for a detailed review of our second quarter results, I would like to first thank him for his leadership and guidance as Interim CFO through the first half of the year. It's the hallmark of ADM leaders to step up when our organization asks for their support, and Ismael has shown that his experience, passion, and knowledge of our business set him apart as one of our best. We are excited to be welcoming Monish Patolawala to ADM as our new CFO in August, and know Ismael has important work to do as he returns to lead EMEA and Animal Nutrition's continued growth. Ismael, over to you.\nIsmael Roig : Thank you, Juan. Let me begin by sharing my own thanks and congratulations for what our finance team has accomplished over the first six months of this year. As a 20-plus year employee of the company, I have seen amazing things our colleagues can accomplish when we work collectively to achieve them. And this was, again, the reality as I stepped in as Interim CFO. I'm proud to have served the company in this capacity over the last several months, and I'm excited to welcome and support Monish as he joins the team. For the second quarter ended June 30th, 2024, earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $0.98. Segment operating profit on a GAAP basis was $1 billion and included charges of $7 million, or approximately $0.01 per share related to impairments. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1 billion for the second quarter, a 37% decrease versus the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.03. Lower pricing and execution margins led to a decline of $1.03 per share versus the prior year period, largely reflecting the impact of lower crush and origination margins. Volume improvement represented a $0.19 per share increase versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting higher volumes in AS&O and Carbohydrate Solutions. Higher costs of $0.07 per share were primarily related to $0.06 per share of unplanned downtime at Decatur East. Share repurchases represented a $0.10 per share increase versus the prior year. During the quarter, there was approximately a $0.02 per share negative impact from mark-to-market timing in the AS&O segment. Please turn to slide 7. For the second quarter, the Ag Services & Oilseeds Team delivered $459 million in operating profit, reflecting on a challenging operating environment compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, mark-to-market timing for the segment was relatively muted. As Juan mentioned, strong supplies out of South America have led to a rebalancing of the supply and demand environment, while also shifting export market competitiveness from North America to South America. These ample supplies have also pressured commodity prices compared to the past two years, resulting in slower-than-expected farmer selling relative to last year and the five year averages. From the demand side, inclusion rates for meal continue to be robust, supporting domestic and export demand. Oil values were pressured during the quarter as imports of used cooking oil as a feedstock for renewable diesel continue to grow. Ag Services results were lower than the prior year, primarily driven by lower results in South American origination, as lower farmers selling due to a smaller-than-expected crop in Mato Grosso and higher logistic costs related to industry take or pay contracts led to lower margins. North America origination saw lower volumes and margins as strong crop yields out of both Brazil and Argentina led to a shift in export competitiveness to South America, as well as limited carries and trading opportunities. As we began the quarter, global demand for both meal and oil remained strong. However, the return of Argentinian crush combined with the increased imports of used cooking oil also weighed on crush margins. As we progress later in the quarter, slower farmers selling in Argentina brought tighter S&D dynamics, driving an improvement in both crush. The team performed well in this environment, leading to an executed soy crush margin of approximately $45 per metric ton for the quarter. While fundamentals supported improving crush margins as we expected, the more balanced S&D environment led to lower margins versus the prior year, translating to lower results. During the quarter, there were approximately $15 million of negative timing impacts versus negative timing impacts of approximately $195 million in the comparable period. In refined products and other, results were lowered due primarily to the reversal of prior positive mark-to-market timing impacts. In North America, increased pretreatment capacity at renewable diesel plants and higher imports of used cooking oil caused refining margins to ease relative to the record levels of last year. The biodiesel margin structure has also come off of record levels versus the prior year as a result of lower LCFS credits and RIN values. During the quarter, there were approximately $90 million of negative timing impacts versus positive timing impacts of approximately $90 million in the comparable period. Equity earnings from Wilmar of $60 million were lower compared to the prior year quarter. Moving to slide 8, the Carbohydrate Solutions team executed well, delivering $357 million in operating profit for the second quarter, which was higher versus the prior year. Industry fundamentals in the Starches & Sweeteners space continue to be supported by strong sweetener demand and an improving starch market. Within ethanol, markets became more constructive as we advanced later in the quarter and stocks moved lower, firming up both domestic and export margins. Demand for ethanol remained robust, supported by summer driving season in the U.S., solid domestic blending rates and export demand. The Starches & Sweeteners subsegment results were higher year-over-year as strong margins and volumes in North America were partially upset by lower margins in the EMEA region as they came off historically high levels. And our operational excellence efforts have helped streamline our processes and overall efficiencies, leading to improved cost positions. In the Vantage Corn Processing subsegment, strong export demand for ethanol supported solid ethanol margins, leading to higher year-over-year results. Moving to slide 9. Nutrition revenues were $1.9 billion for the second quarter, up 3% on a year-over-year basis and sequentially improved from the first quarter. Our Human Nutrition subsegment grew 10% year-over-year, as strong M&A revenue contributions as well as improved volumes and mix and flavors, combined with strong growth in our health and wellness business, more than upset headwinds from lower pricing in the texturants market and lower plant-based protein demand. Our Animal Nutrition subsegment had lower revenues versus the prior year, as lower pricing and mix was partially upset by improved volumes in the base business. Please turn to slide 10. The second quarter marked another quarter of progress with sequential improvement in operating profit for the Nutrition business, when comparing to the prior year quarter, Human Nutrition results were lower, primarily driven by unplanned downtime at Decatur East and lower texturants pricing in the specialty ingredients business. Within Flavors, we have continued to improve operations, which has led to higher shipments sequentially. In Animal Nutrition, results were higher versus the prior year, as improved execution in the base business has led to higher volumes, and cost-optimization actions and lower commodity prices helped support margins, partially upset by lower pet solutions performance in North America and Brazil. Turning to slide 11. For the second quarter, Other segment operating profit was $96 million, up 12% compared to the prior year period, supported by higher captive insurance results due to lower claim activity. ADM investor services results decreased on lower interest income. In corporate for the second quarter, an allocated corporate cost increased on higher global technology investments to support digital transformation efforts, increased legal fees, and increased securitization fees. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows on slide 12, through the second quarter, the company has continued to generate healthy cash flows with $1.7 billion of operating cash flow before working capital. Our current leverage ratio is now within our targeted range, reflecting our disciplined approach to balance sheet management and robust cash flow generation. With robust financial flexibility, we have been able to support both strategic initiatives to support long-term growth and also leverage excess cash for enhanced shareholder returns. During the quarter, we repurchased over 16 million shares through our open market repurchase program, returning approximately $1 billion of capital, thus making the completion of our targeted $2.3 billion of share repurchases for the year. In total, we have returned $2.8 billion of capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends so far in 2024. We also continue to invest in the business with an enhanced focus on the reliability of our asset performance, allocating $700 million to capital expenditures. Now breaking down our expectations for the third quarter by segment on slide 13, in AS&O we anticipate the third quarter to be lower versus the prior year, but improved from the cyclical low margin environment from the second quarter. We anticipate demand for both meal and oil to remain robust and support crush margins, however, likely lower than the levels in the prior year. We anticipate improved process volumes in the third quarter as we enhance our focus on operational excellence across our network, and as our Green Bison JV achieves full run rates. It is also important to note the prior year period also included a $48 million insurance recovery related to damages from Hurricane Ida. In Carbohydrate Solutions, we anticipate a strong third quarter, but lower than the prior year as wheat milling margins moderate off elevated levels. Network optimization and operational excellence will continue to support strong earnings in the second half. We anticipate solid demand for ethanol both domestically and in the export markets, and upside opportunities could be presented if fundamentals hold. In Nutrition, we expect the third quarter to be higher than the prior year period. The team is systematically optimizing the organizational and operational structure across both Human and Animal Nutrition, which are expected to continue to yield cost benefits throughout the year. Coupling this with our efforts to convert pipeline opportunities and drive improved volumes, we anticipate to see continued sequential improvement in the Nutrition business throughout the year. Turning to slide 14 to discuss our full year guidance assumptions. We anticipated increased crop production in South America would lead to lower margins across the AS&O segment in 2024. And the global soybean crush margins would likely be in the range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton for the year, with performance around the midpoint determined by the strength of soybean meal and oil demand. Though the larger crop production in South America did materialize, we experienced slower than average farmers selling in that region, as well as fewer merchandising opportunities in North America through the first half, which weighed negatively on margins in act services. We expect these dynamics to continue to pressure margins in our third quarter. On soybean crush margins, we continue to see robust soybean meal demand based on solid livestock margins and some supply tightness among competing feedstuffs. From the soybean oil side, we expect that as renewable diesel production continues to grow in the second half, the demand for vegetable oil will remain well supported. And with the prospects of a large crop in North America, we perceive increased opportunities for our interior elevator network and processing plants within Oilseeds and Carbohydrates Solutions in the second half. Taking this all together, our expected crush margin remains unchanged from $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton, with recent fundamentals supporting margins above the midpoint. With the first half results largely in line and balancing an improving crush environment with less opportunities and merchandising in the second half, our 2024 earnings per share range remains unchanged. Looking at the other metrics included in our total consolidated guidance, our full year 2024 indications remain unchanged. Back to you, Juan.\nJuan Luciano : Thank you, Ismael. As we think about the rest of 2024 and the lead-up to 2025, we remain optimistic about ADM's ability to execute against our priorities while remaining agile in an evolving environment. The pressures of the current commodity cycle do not seem to be demand-driven, as we see continued robust demand for meal and oil. We will continue to focus on how we can actively manage our global footprint to best match these realities moving through the remainder of the year. Our processing capacities are improving through the year across our production operations, including the ramp-up of Green Bison to full capacity and growing production in Ukraine. And our forward book indicates that ADM is well-positioned to drive value through improved margin opportunities as we move into the back half of the year. AS&O results have remained robust, and we expect solid demand through 2024. Assuming fundamentals hold, we have an opportunity for upside in this part of the business through the year. Our initiatives to manage through the current cycle are expanding additional margin opportunities and opening up new channels to our customers, whether in the growth of destination marketing, the expansion of digital technologies focused on farmer needs, the extension of our Regen Act programs and partnerships, or the growth of our BioSolutions platform. So as market conditions improve, ADM has even more exciting platforms for growth and differences. As noted, we expect to see a significant portion of the planned $500 million cost savings driven by the drive for execution excellence to be realized by the end of this initial year of the program, setting up for potential upside in 2025 as more projects are identified and executed. Our Nutrition business have move beyond green shoots of positive momentum. We now see cyclical improvement across the broader portfolio, flavors, health and wellness, animal nutrition. As this continues through year end, we expect a return to growth that will continue and expand in 2025. In short, progress against our priorities, along with our experienced team's ability to pivot in response to an ever changing external environment, give us confidence in a solid close to the year and set ADM up well for a continued growth trajectory for our full business in 2025. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I wanted to ask about the guidance. It seems like you tempered a little bit the language on the AS&O side. And nothing else really was changed, and you kept the EPS guidance. And so I guess I'm curious if there are kind of any other underlying offsets, or if you're thinking about kind of the range differently at all. And maybe, as we've seen more crush margin strength materialized through the year, how much visibility you have to that?\nJuan Luciano : Yes, thank you, Andrew. Listen, as you know, we have three businesses. Ag Services, I know it is in this, what we call a transition year, if you will, a rebalancing year from tight supplies to more comfortable S&D. So we expected to have a Q2 that was facing challenging conditions, which we did. And I think we navigated well. As we look at the rest of the year and the improvements we have over the quarter in terms of crush margins, we are executing at this point in time, even outside the range of $35 to $60 per metric ton that we gave so. But of course, when you think about our forecast for Ag Services & Oilseeds was heavily weighted on Q4. So to a certain degree, until we can put more businesses into Q4, it's probably that we have the same kind of visibility we had before. That's where we decided not to touch the range. On the other hand, Carb Solutions continue to be improving. And I think that as Ismael said in his remarks, if current ethanol margins that have improved over the quarter continue to stay that way, we could have an upside there. And certainly Nutrition continues to make significant improvements year-over-year now versus just being sequential before. So we're optimistic about the second half. We just didn't want to change the guidance at this point in time since it's heavily loaded towards Q4.\nOperator: We now turn to Tom Palmer with Citi.\nTom Palmer: Good morning, and thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the Nutrition side, you reiterated the outlook for a second profit to increase year-over-year for the full year. I first just wanted to confirm that this is after adding back the write-down in the fourth quarter, so off I think kind of a $495 billion base. And then second, I wondered if you could elaborate a bit on the key drivers of these improvements over the next couple of quarters. The implication would seem to be that 3Q is up year-over-year. And sorry, the implication of 3Q being up year-over-year, would it seem to imply like a pretty meaningful increase between 2Q and 3Q. I think historically we've seen the opposite where 2Q is a bit more reasonably strong. So just any help on that sequential improvement and then off just the base that we're looking to grow as we look at this year. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano : Yes, Tom. Yes, the base is what you describe, you are correct in your assumption there. Let me give you some feel here. The sequential improvement continues in the business, as we said, and that's when we start looking at Q3, it looks like it's going to be year-over-year improvement, which marks a significant improvement in Q3 versus Q2. If I go through the different segments, if you will, Flavors continues to do well. I think the business is up in sales 6%, excluding M&A. Of course, it's still reeling with some higher cost because of all the demand fulfillment improvements we needed to make. But demand is coming back to normal, recovering after this tuck-in period. So we feel good about our pipeline there. We feel good about our prospects for Flavor. Specialty ingredients continue to have a challenge in time. Demand is often we are working through our plant issues. Also, we have the issue of texturants or more specifically emulsifiers in that area are coming down after significant record prices last year, if you will. Health and wellness continue to be very strong. Biotic sales growth is up to 22%. And I think that the pipeline there and the prospects continue to be very strong. When you think about Animal sector, in Animal Nutrition, excluding pet, improvement continues. And based on a strong self-help plan, so it's pretty much under our control, so we feel good about that. Pet Solutions is finding mixed results around the globe. If, I would say, Brazil market conditions continue to be challenging, North America, specifically the US, is still having some demand fulfillment issues. But we are looking good in terms of the improvements we are making towards Q3. And Mexico, our B2C business continues to be very strong. So I would say, overall, with the exception of specialty ingredients, which is the weak part, the rest of the business is looking good. So we expect significant improvements sequentially. And I will start making them improvements year-over-year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research.\nHeather Jones: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to ask about oilseed process volumes. So they were up 1% for the quarter. But in Q1, they were up nearly 9%. And you remarked that utilization of Spiritwood was full for the quarter. So, I was just wondering if there were one-time issues during the quarter and if so, there's been rectified in order to reach all mid to high single-digit growth outlook for the year.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. Thank you, Heather. As you said, yes, Spiritwood is performing very well, so is coming up in volumes. Traditionally, I would say in North America, when we have our low part of the cycle in North America, where South America has all the capacity, we take shutdowns in anticipation of demand not being very strong and we want to have our plants ready for the harvest. So, I think that's a traditional seasonal slowdown that we do. So, nothing unusual in that regard.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to maybe drill in on some of the cost and productivity initiatives that you have underway right now. And I think, one, there's a target of $500 million savings by the end of 2025, kind of split between the two years. Can you maybe provide an update on what you've realized to date in 2024, what the 2024 savings kind of are expected to be on a net basis and maybe any additional color in terms of where within the portfolio those are actually hitting the P&L? I really appreciate it. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano : Yes, thank you, Adam, for the question. Yes, we're very proud of how this initiative that we put together at the beginning of the year has continued to accelerate. So far, we are on track. If you think about $500 million in over two years. That's about %125 million per half. We delivered about $127 million in the first half. So we're pretty much on track there. But this group of activities and projects and ideas continue to accelerate. So that's not going to be linear. It's going to be an accelerated bringing up to the P&L and to the bottom line. So we feel very good about it. We are very confident that our forecast shows that we're going to deliver on the $500 million way before the two year mark. With regard to what's the distribution of that, of course, sometimes when you have more bigger manufacturing units or bigger energy consumption, like in Carb Solutions, you have more opportunities to bring that. So I would say, if I were to name a ranking today. Initially, out of the gate, we see more in Carb Solutions and Nutrition because of some of the improvements we needed to make in demand fulfillment, and maybe Ag Services & Oilseeds having to pick a momentum during the second half, so we will see that. So but overall, I think good distribution of projects around the four geographies and the three businesses, and again, catching momentum when you have a big organization that you need to promote all these activities, so not everybody starts at the same time, so we feel very good by being on track, and again, we think ahead of schedule for our $500 million over two years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays.\nBen Theurer: Hi, yes, good morning, Juan, Ismael. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the Nutrition business and just understand a little bit what your cadence is into the back half as the Decatur East plan is going to come back in. You've selected the $25 million higher fixed cost observation. We just wanted to understand how immediately are you going to be able to gain this back, so as we move into the ramp-up of this, the East part of Decatur, how should we think about those cost headwinds that we've seen over the past? Is that to be recovered in \u201824, or is that more of the \u201825 thing? Thank you.\nIsmael Roig : Yes, thank you for the question. From the point of view of plant protein, we do expect the plants to come online again in Q4, so we will see some of that recovery coming in. I think as we look at the second half, we significantly pulled quite a bit of volume out in 2023 as a result, obviously, of the Decatur East facility, but also, we had in demand fulfillment. So I did report -- we did report a 3% revenue growth, as we look into the second half, we are seeing an acceleration of that, and we expect to grow, to be on track to deliver roughly in the mid-single digit growth when we bring back some of these facilities and demand fulfillment capabilities that we had lost in the second half of \u201823.\nJuan Luciano : I would say that maybe complimenting Ismael, I think is a \u201925 impact not very much \u201924 impact given in the Q4 so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS.\nManav Gupta: Hi. A quick question. We are seeing a very strong rebound in ethanol margins, and it's just seasonal. Is it what's else going out there? Do you think this sustains itself in the second half, and then how does that position you well in the Sweeteners and Starches business across in the second half? Thank you.\nJuan Luciano : Yes, thank you, Manav, for the question. We have been seeing for a while that exports have been increasing year-over-year, so ethanol continues to be one of the cheapest alkoxylates out there, and it's very competitive with gasoline in many parts of the world. So we have seen a strong domestic demand because of miles driven in the U.S., especially now with the summer. We have been seeing good blending in the U.S. I think the price of ethanol is very competitive to encourage blending. And we have seen exports at levels that we've never seen before, probably north of 1.7, maybe even 1.9 billion gallons per year. So I think that was a very logical kind of when you see that the strong demand was very logical, that prices will rebound. And, again, we don't see any change for now. It will depend on how much the U.S. produces, of course, of ethanol. But at this point in time, margins are holding, and we think that it bodes well for a strong Q3. In terms of Sweeteners and Starches, that business continues to have very robust volumes and very good margins. If anything, you can see a little bit of a pullback of the energy complex, if you will. That bodes well for manufacturing costs, because these are big facilities that consume a lot of energy. So natural gas prices being close to $2 is a little bit of a tailwind for us. So, Carb Solution is having a very good year so, and we expect that to continue.\nIsmael Roig : I'd like to compliment on the Sweeteners & Starches side, as you know, there's been a fairly low corn crop in Mexico, and that has certainly helped with exports of sweetener and starches products into Mexico. So it's created a demand pool into Mexico that has helped the overall market structure for our business in North America.\nOperator: We now turn to Salvator Tiano with Bank of America.\nSalvator Tiano: Thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify a little bit on the crush margins. So again, I think you made in your prepared remarks a comment that soybean crush margins were $45 per ton in Q2, and at least based on the report, EBITDA, I don't know if I'm missing something, and I may not be fully comparable, but it looks like your crush margins per ton were much, much lower than that. So what am I missing here? Are you easier, I guess, benchmarked the way you're presenting the $35 to $60 material different from what we would see, for example, on Bloomberg synthetic margin? And you made also the comment that you recently executed the trades, I guess, above the top end of the range, above $60. So can you elaborate a little bit on that? Are we talking about just one of trades, or is it something that you're actually consistently generating so far in Q3?\nJuan Luciano : Sure. Let me clarify for you. First of all, the $45 per ton is the $45 per ton we made this year. So we can work offline to walk you through the arithmetic, if you will, but there's nothing strange on that. If I go around the world, if you will, on crush margins, at this point between $60 to $70 in the US, that's where we are making businesses, about similar margins for soy in Europe, Brazil may be something between $10 and $50 depending on their domestic plants or export plants, China, $20 to $25, that kind of the margin environment. I would say when we started the quarter, we were doing margins in the low end of our range and as maybe Argentine farmers did not sell, as maybe the industry was expecting, we saw more demand for soybean milk coming into North America that make an improvement in our crush margins, so we finished the quarter a little bit better than maybe we thought, about the $45 per ton. We are selling, we said before that we were relatively open going out. We have some of the Q3 sold, what we don't have sold, we are selling at about $60 to $70 per ton. So that's the crush realities at this point in time. So I think that then we're going to leap into Q4 where we have hopefully a very large crop here in the US. Crops look terrific so far in the US, so we expect to have plenty of raw materials in that. And demand for soybean milk continues to be strong around the world and I think low prices have incentivated demand. Demand is driven a lot by poultry, as you know, and soybean milk has been increasing in the Russians. And then on the oil side, we continue to see a little bit more RGG plants coming on the stream on the second half, so that will bode well as well. So we are positive about crush margins for the rest of the year for North America.\nOperator: We now turn to Dushyant Ailani with Jefferies.\nDushyant Ailani: Hi. Can you hear me? Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to talk on the CapEx guide. I think it's improved or it\u2019s increased by about $300 million. I just wanted to see what's driving that.\nIsmael Roig : Yes. I think CapEx is always, the prioritization of CapEx is always NDE, so maintenance and safety and quality we do first. So whatever the plants need at any point in time. So that's a bottom up, roll up of their respective needs. Then we fill it up with cost projects, which the execution excellence challenge that we have to deliver $500 million and bring in more ideas, some of those ideas require CapEx. So you can see that growing and then there are growth projects around the world. So I would say nothing specifically is a little bit of everybody else executing on their plans. So I would say nothing. There is a little bit of CapEx inflation as well in our numbers because things are a little bit more expensive than maybe they were two years ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley.\nSteven Haynes: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to Argentina. You mentioned it's kind of been a bit of a tailwind kind of towards the end of the second quarter on some slower than expected farmer selling. So how are you kind of thinking about how that evolves over the balance of the year and what's you kind of helps us think about the risk Argentia kind of coming back into the market in a more meaningful way going forward? Thank you.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. So what happened in Argentina, there was a big expectation for the unification of the exchange rate. And of course that hasn't happened so far. On the contrary, the GAAP has increased to about 50% or 55%. So at this point in time, when you combine low commodity prices because of all the abundant production and then the exchange rate, it's not very favorable for the farmer to sell. So the farmer in Argentina is selling a little bit more corn but trying to hold the beans. Will the government, so the question is, will the government be able to unify the exchange rate? I think the government's priorities right now is to fight inflation. And that was the whole plan. So they don't have a lot of room to maneuver to change something because the moment you divide, you change the exchange rate, everything is translated into prices. And the priority right now is to control prices. So I think this is for the good of Argentina long-term as a country, but I think short term will present a problem for the farmer to sell. So I think the farmer will hold as much as possible unless there is a special program that the government rolls out that they don't seem to have a lot of latitude to do so at this point in time. So I think we need to be cautious about the thinking that a lot of the crop will come as a glut to Argentina. It hasn't happened so far.\nOperator: We have a follow up question from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research.\nHeather Jones: Thanks for taking the follow up. I wanted to ask about the Chinese UCO into the U .S. situation. So our understanding is those are slow some and then there is an expectation that with Europe imposing anti-dumping duties on Chinese biodiesel that China may shift more of their UCO to that market and not as much as the U.S. And just wondering what you all are seeing there and how you are expecting that to evolve throughout the year?\nJuan Luciano : Yes, thank you, Heather. So of course there was a lot of noise by the industry about the prospects of maybe some adulterated or not quite truly UCO coming into the U.S. and checking for that. So we have seen some significant moderation of that coming. I don't want to pinpoint a particular reason, but part of that what you mentioned maybe in Europe is true as well. Europe will not allow raw crops to be part of that. So as they start to build SIF, they will have to use more UCO. So it's naturally that some of those flows would move to Europe. The current North American feedstock market is better balanced after the situation we have in Q1. So I think also we saw palm oil going up in prices. So I think that it's bodes better for soybean oil going forward for the U.S.\nOperator: We have another follow-up from Salvator Tiano with Bank of America.\nSalvator Tiano: Yes. Thank you very much. I just want to ask about the ethanol outlook, and I know you talked about a lot of factors here, but clearly your commentary on the starches and sweeteners, which include, I guess, the wet meals, was more negative, saying about lower ethanol margins year-on-year, whereas VCP, being the dry meals, it was much, much higher year-on-year. So can you discuss a little bit the differentiation there, and it seems like a lot of the delta is from the export side. So essentially, are you seeing different pricing, different margins from the exports, and as they become a much more important part of the ethanol mix, which we weren't used to in the past, is this something that besides being a driver of demand and operating rates, is it something that's margin accretive, or do the netbacks tend to be lower for export ethanol?\nJuan Luciano : Yes, there are several factors, Salvator, here in place. So first of all, the ethanol margins are the ethanol margins, and they are better right now. They are probably twice as big as they were at the beginning of the quarter. There are some particular export markets where we can export as a premium, and we're taking advantage on that. I don't have top of my head where we export those from in terms of plants. But at this point in time, I would say the challenge, not the challenge, but maybe the activity has been on the logistics side to make sure that we can fulfill all the exports and we can get the materials to the ports, because, as you said, and I said before, demand has been very strong, and margins are very good, so we need to take advantage on that. Plants are running well. As I said, costs are coming a little bit lower, so this all bodes well for the forecast. And there's no reason for demand to change significantly outside of the world. We have a basket of countries where we are exporting is very well balanced. So at this point in time, we're looking at Q3 with optimism.\nOperator: We have another follow-up from Andrew Strelzik with BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you. I wanted to just get your perspective on broader biofuels policy. As we get deeper into the back part of the year here, we're getting close to some upcoming upcoming changes obviously the PTC maybe decisions around the RBO import export dynamic so just was curious for some updated thoughts about how those policy shifts will impact your business and whether you think there's risk on the timing of some of those things getting done. It feels like some of the timing around biofuels policy has been a moving target in a number of different ways. So just curious for how you're thinking about that progressing and impacting your business from here? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano : Yes. I think all these regulatory frameworks creates movements and uncertainty, the more clarity the industry can have of course the better. I think you have to think about the message around biodiesel blenders credit to a producer credit is, at the end of the day we still have a higher mandate for 2025 and a real deficit in 2024. So I think that you have to think that vegetables oil will be part of the solution to filling that mandate, ultimately the pie is getting bigger here and not the vegetable oil should be gaining on the low CI products especially now that California's CFS credits have come down a little bit. So I think that the problem with these are the short terms gyrations of that is very difficult to know what's going to happen Q4 so maybe we have accelerated buying in Q4 maybe we have a little bit of a slowdown in Q1. But I think overall as we look at that overall policy is constructive for all these and we see more demand and the pie getting bigger. So I think it's all positive for crush margins in the medium or long term calling it by quarter is more difficult.\nOperator: We have no further questions, so I'll now hand back to Megan Britt for closing remarks.\nMegan Britt : Thank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up with me if you have additional questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call is now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Juan Luciano",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan and good morning to all of who have joined for today's call. Today, ADM report its second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1 billion. Our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.7%. We delivered a strong cash flow from operations before working capital at $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, this equates to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.49 and an adjusted segment operating profit of $2.3 billion. Our team delivered solid results in challenging market conditions, highlighting the efforts of our teams across the business to manage through the commodity down cycle while putting our nutrition business on a path to recovery. Additionally, we saw signs of improving fundamentals within crush and ethanol later in the quarter, positioning us for a strong second half. We're also flexing our capital allocation strategy to return cash to shareholders, completing our planned share repurchases for the quarter and delivering our 370th consecutive quarterly dividend. Next slide, please. Let's start by reviewing the top-line results of our business units alongside our efforts to manage the cycle through productivity and innovation. Our service analysis results are significantly lower than the record results of prior years due to the ongoing rebalancing of the supply and demand environment and overall lower farmer selling. In anticipation of this year's challenges, we focus on driving stronger production volumes and actively leveraging our footprint to match supply to demand around the globe. We've also focused on differentiation opportunities, extending margins and growing volumes by more than 20% year-over-year in areas like destination marketing, achieving our targeted run rate in our Green Bison JV for renewable green diesel feedstocks, and bringing new solutions to our customers through innovations such as our recent EUDR-compliant fully traceable soybean program and the expansion of our regenerative agriculture partnerships and acreage. These regenec programs highlight our leadership in this space. ABM was named the finalist in Fast Company's world changing ideas in May. And just last week we released our second annual regenec report detailing the data backed results we are achieving across our global operations. Carbohydrate Solutions have continued the solid performance trajectory driven by strong margins for sweeteners, starches, and flour with higher volumes year-over-year. Ethanol margins also strengthened as industry production tried to keep pace with robust export and domestic demand. Along with this performance, we are continuing to drive innovation-based growth through the sustainability centered evolution of the business. We have delivered 7% year-to-date volume expansion across our BioSolutions platform, increased starch capacity in our Marshall, Minnesota facility to meet growing demand from food, beverage, and industrial customers, and in a milestone for our strategic partnership, Solugen recently broke ground on a 500,000 square foot biomanufacturing facility that will use ADM source dextrose for applications in water treatment, agriculture, energy, and home and personal care. Within our productivity agenda, the drive for execution excellence is continuing to deliver simplification and cost-saving opportunities across the enterprise. In Q2, we advance hundreds of projects that put us clearly on the path to the plan $500 million in cost reduction over the next two years. We are accelerating these efforts and expect to see a significant portion of these savings by the end of 2024. Our focus on returning nutrition to its growth trajectory is also taking hold, and we are seeing sequential top-line improvement as compared to our previous two quarters. While we are experiencing some downward pressure with texture and some protein demand, we draw strong growth in health and wellness sales, along with flavor sales growth, and excellent contributions from our recent acquisitions. In our targeted areas of focus, we are continuing to make progress. We continue to improve demand fulfillment for Flavors in our EMEA region, following the implementation of one ADM. We're optimizing cost across the Animal Nutrition portfolio, building the foundation to drive continued sequential improvement across the core of the segment. The use of our refined M&A playbook with our recent flavor acquisitions has proven to be an important accelerator to integration and the ongoing growth of our leading global Flavors business. And our innovation agenda is paying off, driving Human Nutrition revenues up 6% year-to-date, driven by flavors and our science-backed health and wellness portfolio. Our capital allocation efforts continued through the second quarter as we completed our planned shared repurchases and announced our most recent dividend. We have already returned $2.8 billion of capital to shareholders to date. The second quarter marked an important point in our efforts to manage through the market realities of 2024 and deliver on our priorities. Across all three businesses, we are evolving to drive new pockets of growth in the near term while positioning ADM to take full advantage of macro trends of sustainability, health and well-being, and food security in the longer term. As we continue to drive operational excellence and make progress on our key priorities, we have confidence in our full year expectations despite uncertainties in the external environment. Before I hand over to Ismael for a detailed review of our second quarter results, I would like to first thank him for his leadership and guidance as Interim CFO through the first half of the year. It's the hallmark of ADM leaders to step up when our organization asks for their support, and Ismael has shown that his experience, passion, and knowledge of our business set him apart as one of our best. We are excited to be welcoming Monish Patolawala to ADM as our new CFO in August, and know Ismael has important work to do as he returns to lead EMEA and Animal Nutrition's continued growth. Ismael, over to you. Thank you, Ismael. As we think about the rest of 2024 and the lead-up to 2025, we remain optimistic about ADM's ability to execute against our priorities while remaining agile in an evolving environment. The pressures of the current commodity cycle do not seem to be demand-driven, as we see continued robust demand for meal and oil. We will continue to focus on how we can actively manage our global footprint to best match these realities moving through the remainder of the year. Our processing capacities are improving through the year across our production operations, including the ramp-up of Green Bison to full capacity and growing production in Ukraine. And our forward book indicates that ADM is well-positioned to drive value through improved margin opportunities as we move into the back half of the year. AS&O results have remained robust, and we expect solid demand through 2024. Assuming fundamentals hold, we have an opportunity for upside in this part of the business through the year. Our initiatives to manage through the current cycle are expanding additional margin opportunities and opening up new channels to our customers, whether in the growth of destination marketing, the expansion of digital technologies focused on farmer needs, the extension of our Regen Act programs and partnerships, or the growth of our BioSolutions platform. So as market conditions improve, ADM has even more exciting platforms for growth and differences. As noted, we expect to see a significant portion of the planned $500 million cost savings driven by the drive for execution excellence to be realized by the end of this initial year of the program, setting up for potential upside in 2025 as more projects are identified and executed. Our Nutrition business have move beyond green shoots of positive momentum. We now see cyclical improvement across the broader portfolio, flavors, health and wellness, animal nutrition. As this continues through year end, we expect a return to growth that will continue and expand in 2025. In short, progress against our priorities, along with our experienced team's ability to pivot in response to an ever changing external environment, give us confidence in a solid close to the year and set ADM up well for a continued growth trajectory for our full business in 2025. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, thank you, Andrew. Listen, as you know, we have three businesses. Ag Services, I know it is in this, what we call a transition year, if you will, a rebalancing year from tight supplies to more comfortable S&D. So we expected to have a Q2 that was facing challenging conditions, which we did. And I think we navigated well. As we look at the rest of the year and the improvements we have over the quarter in terms of crush margins, we are executing at this point in time, even outside the range of $35 to $60 per metric ton that we gave so. But of course, when you think about our forecast for Ag Services & Oilseeds was heavily weighted on Q4. So to a certain degree, until we can put more businesses into Q4, it's probably that we have the same kind of visibility we had before. That's where we decided not to touch the range. On the other hand, Carb Solutions continue to be improving. And I think that as Ismael said in his remarks, if current ethanol margins that have improved over the quarter continue to stay that way, we could have an upside there. And certainly Nutrition continues to make significant improvements year-over-year now versus just being sequential before. So we're optimistic about the second half. We just didn't want to change the guidance at this point in time since it's heavily loaded towards Q4. Yes, Tom. Yes, the base is what you describe, you are correct in your assumption there. Let me give you some feel here. The sequential improvement continues in the business, as we said, and that's when we start looking at Q3, it looks like it's going to be year-over-year improvement, which marks a significant improvement in Q3 versus Q2. If I go through the different segments, if you will, Flavors continues to do well. I think the business is up in sales 6%, excluding M&A. Of course, it's still reeling with some higher cost because of all the demand fulfillment improvements we needed to make. But demand is coming back to normal, recovering after this tuck-in period. So we feel good about our pipeline there. We feel good about our prospects for Flavor. Specialty ingredients continue to have a challenge in time. Demand is often we are working through our plant issues. Also, we have the issue of texturants or more specifically emulsifiers in that area are coming down after significant record prices last year, if you will. Health and wellness continue to be very strong. Biotic sales growth is up to 22%. And I think that the pipeline there and the prospects continue to be very strong. When you think about Animal sector, in Animal Nutrition, excluding pet, improvement continues. And based on a strong self-help plan, so it's pretty much under our control, so we feel good about that. Pet Solutions is finding mixed results around the globe. If, I would say, Brazil market conditions continue to be challenging, North America, specifically the US, is still having some demand fulfillment issues. But we are looking good in terms of the improvements we are making towards Q3. And Mexico, our B2C business continues to be very strong. So I would say, overall, with the exception of specialty ingredients, which is the weak part, the rest of the business is looking good. So we expect significant improvements sequentially. And I will start making them improvements year-over-year. Yes. Thank you, Heather. As you said, yes, Spiritwood is performing very well, so is coming up in volumes. Traditionally, I would say in North America, when we have our low part of the cycle in North America, where South America has all the capacity, we take shutdowns in anticipation of demand not being very strong and we want to have our plants ready for the harvest. So, I think that's a traditional seasonal slowdown that we do. So, nothing unusual in that regard. Yes, thank you, Adam, for the question. Yes, we're very proud of how this initiative that we put together at the beginning of the year has continued to accelerate. So far, we are on track. If you think about $500 million in over two years. That's about %125 million per half. We delivered about $127 million in the first half. So we're pretty much on track there. But this group of activities and projects and ideas continue to accelerate. So that's not going to be linear. It's going to be an accelerated bringing up to the P&L and to the bottom line. So we feel very good about it. We are very confident that our forecast shows that we're going to deliver on the $500 million way before the two year mark. With regard to what's the distribution of that, of course, sometimes when you have more bigger manufacturing units or bigger energy consumption, like in Carb Solutions, you have more opportunities to bring that. So I would say, if I were to name a ranking today. Initially, out of the gate, we see more in Carb Solutions and Nutrition because of some of the improvements we needed to make in demand fulfillment, and maybe Ag Services & Oilseeds having to pick a momentum during the second half, so we will see that. So but overall, I think good distribution of projects around the four geographies and the three businesses, and again, catching momentum when you have a big organization that you need to promote all these activities, so not everybody starts at the same time, so we feel very good by being on track, and again, we think ahead of schedule for our $500 million over two years. I would say that maybe complimenting Ismael, I think is a '25 impact not very much '24 impact given in the Q4 so. Yes, thank you, Manav, for the question. We have been seeing for a while that exports have been increasing year-over-year, so ethanol continues to be one of the cheapest alkoxylates out there, and it's very competitive with gasoline in many parts of the world. So we have seen a strong domestic demand because of miles driven in the U.S., especially now with the summer. We have been seeing good blending in the U.S. I think the price of ethanol is very competitive to encourage blending. And we have seen exports at levels that we've never seen before, probably north of 1.7, maybe even 1.9 billion gallons per year. So I think that was a very logical kind of when you see that the strong demand was very logical, that prices will rebound. And, again, we don't see any change for now. It will depend on how much the U.S. produces, of course, of ethanol. But at this point in time, margins are holding, and we think that it bodes well for a strong Q3. In terms of Sweeteners and Starches, that business continues to have very robust volumes and very good margins. If anything, you can see a little bit of a pullback of the energy complex, if you will. That bodes well for manufacturing costs, because these are big facilities that consume a lot of energy. So natural gas prices being close to $2 is a little bit of a tailwind for us. So, Carb Solution is having a very good year so, and we expect that to continue. Sure. Let me clarify for you. First of all, the $45 per ton is the $45 per ton we made this year. So we can work offline to walk you through the arithmetic, if you will, but there's nothing strange on that. If I go around the world, if you will, on crush margins, at this point between $60 to $70 in the US, that's where we are making businesses, about similar margins for soy in Europe, Brazil may be something between $10 and $50 depending on their domestic plants or export plants, China, $20 to $25, that kind of the margin environment. I would say when we started the quarter, we were doing margins in the low end of our range and as maybe Argentine farmers did not sell, as maybe the industry was expecting, we saw more demand for soybean milk coming into North America that make an improvement in our crush margins, so we finished the quarter a little bit better than maybe we thought, about the $45 per ton. We are selling, we said before that we were relatively open going out. We have some of the Q3 sold, what we don't have sold, we are selling at about $60 to $70 per ton. So that's the crush realities at this point in time. So I think that then we're going to leap into Q4 where we have hopefully a very large crop here in the US. Crops look terrific so far in the US, so we expect to have plenty of raw materials in that. And demand for soybean milk continues to be strong around the world and I think low prices have incentivated demand. Demand is driven a lot by poultry, as you know, and soybean milk has been increasing in the Russians. And then on the oil side, we continue to see a little bit more RGG plants coming on the stream on the second half, so that will bode well as well. So we are positive about crush margins for the rest of the year for North America. Yes. So what happened in Argentina, there was a big expectation for the unification of the exchange rate. And of course that hasn't happened so far. On the contrary, the GAAP has increased to about 50% or 55%. So at this point in time, when you combine low commodity prices because of all the abundant production and then the exchange rate, it's not very favorable for the farmer to sell. So the farmer in Argentina is selling a little bit more corn but trying to hold the beans. Will the government, so the question is, will the government be able to unify the exchange rate? I think the government's priorities right now is to fight inflation. And that was the whole plan. So they don't have a lot of room to maneuver to change something because the moment you divide, you change the exchange rate, everything is translated into prices. And the priority right now is to control prices. So I think this is for the good of Argentina long-term as a country, but I think short term will present a problem for the farmer to sell. So I think the farmer will hold as much as possible unless there is a special program that the government rolls out that they don't seem to have a lot of latitude to do so at this point in time. So I think we need to be cautious about the thinking that a lot of the crop will come as a glut to Argentina. It hasn't happened so far. Yes, thank you, Heather. So of course there was a lot of noise by the industry about the prospects of maybe some adulterated or not quite truly UCO coming into the U.S. and checking for that. So we have seen some significant moderation of that coming. I don't want to pinpoint a particular reason, but part of that what you mentioned maybe in Europe is true as well. Europe will not allow raw crops to be part of that. So as they start to build SIF, they will have to use more UCO. So it's naturally that some of those flows would move to Europe. The current North American feedstock market is better balanced after the situation we have in Q1. So I think also we saw palm oil going up in prices. So I think that it's bodes better for soybean oil going forward for the U.S. Yes, there are several factors, Salvator, here in place. So first of all, the ethanol margins are the ethanol margins, and they are better right now. They are probably twice as big as they were at the beginning of the quarter. There are some particular export markets where we can export as a premium, and we're taking advantage on that. I don't have top of my head where we export those from in terms of plants. But at this point in time, I would say the challenge, not the challenge, but maybe the activity has been on the logistics side to make sure that we can fulfill all the exports and we can get the materials to the ports, because, as you said, and I said before, demand has been very strong, and margins are very good, so we need to take advantage on that. Plants are running well. As I said, costs are coming a little bit lower, so this all bodes well for the forecast. And there's no reason for demand to change significantly outside of the world. We have a basket of countries where we are exporting is very well balanced. So at this point in time, we're looking at Q3 with optimism. Yes. I think all these regulatory frameworks creates movements and uncertainty, the more clarity the industry can have of course the better. I think you have to think about the message around biodiesel blenders credit to a producer credit is, at the end of the day we still have a higher mandate for 2025 and a real deficit in 2024. So I think that you have to think that vegetables oil will be part of the solution to filling that mandate, ultimately the pie is getting bigger here and not the vegetable oil should be gaining on the low CI products especially now that California's CFS credits have come down a little bit. So I think that the problem with these are the short terms gyrations of that is very difficult to know what's going to happen Q4 so maybe we have accelerated buying in Q4 maybe we have a little bit of a slowdown in Q1. But I think overall as we look at that overall policy is constructive for all these and we see more demand and the pie getting bigger. So I think it's all positive for crush margins in the medium or long term calling it by quarter is more difficult."

            "name": "Ismael Roig",
            "content": "Thank you, Juan. Let me begin by sharing my own thanks and congratulations for what our finance team has accomplished over the first six months of this year. As a 20-plus year employee of the company, I have seen amazing things our colleagues can accomplish when we work collectively to achieve them. And this was, again, the reality as I stepped in as Interim CFO. I'm proud to have served the company in this capacity over the last several months, and I'm excited to welcome and support Monish as he joins the team. For the second quarter ended June 30th, 2024, earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $0.98. Segment operating profit on a GAAP basis was $1 billion and included charges of $7 million, or approximately $0.01 per share related to impairments. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1 billion for the second quarter, a 37% decrease versus the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.03. Lower pricing and execution margins led to a decline of $1.03 per share versus the prior year period, largely reflecting the impact of lower crush and origination margins. Volume improvement represented a $0.19 per share increase versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting higher volumes in AS&O and Carbohydrate Solutions. Higher costs of $0.07 per share were primarily related to $0.06 per share of unplanned downtime at Decatur East. Share repurchases represented a $0.10 per share increase versus the prior year. During the quarter, there was approximately a $0.02 per share negative impact from mark-to-market timing in the AS&O segment. Please turn to slide 7. For the second quarter, the Ag Services & Oilseeds Team delivered $459 million in operating profit, reflecting on a challenging operating environment compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, mark-to-market timing for the segment was relatively muted. As Juan mentioned, strong supplies out of South America have led to a rebalancing of the supply and demand environment, while also shifting export market competitiveness from North America to South America. These ample supplies have also pressured commodity prices compared to the past two years, resulting in slower-than-expected farmer selling relative to last year and the five year averages. From the demand side, inclusion rates for meal continue to be robust, supporting domestic and export demand. Oil values were pressured during the quarter as imports of used cooking oil as a feedstock for renewable diesel continue to grow. Ag Services results were lower than the prior year, primarily driven by lower results in South American origination, as lower farmers selling due to a smaller-than-expected crop in Mato Grosso and higher logistic costs related to industry take or pay contracts led to lower margins. North America origination saw lower volumes and margins as strong crop yields out of both Brazil and Argentina led to a shift in export competitiveness to South America, as well as limited carries and trading opportunities. As we began the quarter, global demand for both meal and oil remained strong. However, the return of Argentinian crush combined with the increased imports of used cooking oil also weighed on crush margins. As we progress later in the quarter, slower farmers selling in Argentina brought tighter S&D dynamics, driving an improvement in both crush. The team performed well in this environment, leading to an executed soy crush margin of approximately $45 per metric ton for the quarter. While fundamentals supported improving crush margins as we expected, the more balanced S&D environment led to lower margins versus the prior year, translating to lower results. During the quarter, there were approximately $15 million of negative timing impacts versus negative timing impacts of approximately $195 million in the comparable period. In refined products and other, results were lowered due primarily to the reversal of prior positive mark-to-market timing impacts. In North America, increased pretreatment capacity at renewable diesel plants and higher imports of used cooking oil caused refining margins to ease relative to the record levels of last year. The biodiesel margin structure has also come off of record levels versus the prior year as a result of lower LCFS credits and RIN values. During the quarter, there were approximately $90 million of negative timing impacts versus positive timing impacts of approximately $90 million in the comparable period. Equity earnings from Wilmar of $60 million were lower compared to the prior year quarter. Moving to slide 8, the Carbohydrate Solutions team executed well, delivering $357 million in operating profit for the second quarter, which was higher versus the prior year. Industry fundamentals in the Starches & Sweeteners space continue to be supported by strong sweetener demand and an improving starch market. Within ethanol, markets became more constructive as we advanced later in the quarter and stocks moved lower, firming up both domestic and export margins. Demand for ethanol remained robust, supported by summer driving season in the U.S., solid domestic blending rates and export demand. The Starches & Sweeteners subsegment results were higher year-over-year as strong margins and volumes in North America were partially upset by lower margins in the EMEA region as they came off historically high levels. And our operational excellence efforts have helped streamline our processes and overall efficiencies, leading to improved cost positions. In the Vantage Corn Processing subsegment, strong export demand for ethanol supported solid ethanol margins, leading to higher year-over-year results. Moving to slide 9. Nutrition revenues were $1.9 billion for the second quarter, up 3% on a year-over-year basis and sequentially improved from the first quarter. Our Human Nutrition subsegment grew 10% year-over-year, as strong M&A revenue contributions as well as improved volumes and mix and flavors, combined with strong growth in our health and wellness business, more than upset headwinds from lower pricing in the texturants market and lower plant-based protein demand. Our Animal Nutrition subsegment had lower revenues versus the prior year, as lower pricing and mix was partially upset by improved volumes in the base business. Please turn to slide 10. The second quarter marked another quarter of progress with sequential improvement in operating profit for the Nutrition business, when comparing to the prior year quarter, Human Nutrition results were lower, primarily driven by unplanned downtime at Decatur East and lower texturants pricing in the specialty ingredients business. Within Flavors, we have continued to improve operations, which has led to higher shipments sequentially. In Animal Nutrition, results were higher versus the prior year, as improved execution in the base business has led to higher volumes, and cost-optimization actions and lower commodity prices helped support margins, partially upset by lower pet solutions performance in North America and Brazil. Turning to slide 11. For the second quarter, Other segment operating profit was $96 million, up 12% compared to the prior year period, supported by higher captive insurance results due to lower claim activity. ADM investor services results decreased on lower interest income. In corporate for the second quarter, an allocated corporate cost increased on higher global technology investments to support digital transformation efforts, increased legal fees, and increased securitization fees. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows on slide 12, through the second quarter, the company has continued to generate healthy cash flows with $1.7 billion of operating cash flow before working capital. Our current leverage ratio is now within our targeted range, reflecting our disciplined approach to balance sheet management and robust cash flow generation. With robust financial flexibility, we have been able to support both strategic initiatives to support long-term growth and also leverage excess cash for enhanced shareholder returns. During the quarter, we repurchased over 16 million shares through our open market repurchase program, returning approximately $1 billion of capital, thus making the completion of our targeted $2.3 billion of share repurchases for the year. In total, we have returned $2.8 billion of capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends so far in 2024. We also continue to invest in the business with an enhanced focus on the reliability of our asset performance, allocating $700 million to capital expenditures. Now breaking down our expectations for the third quarter by segment on slide 13, in AS&O we anticipate the third quarter to be lower versus the prior year, but improved from the cyclical low margin environment from the second quarter. We anticipate demand for both meal and oil to remain robust and support crush margins, however, likely lower than the levels in the prior year. We anticipate improved process volumes in the third quarter as we enhance our focus on operational excellence across our network, and as our Green Bison JV achieves full run rates. It is also important to note the prior year period also included a $48 million insurance recovery related to damages from Hurricane Ida. In Carbohydrate Solutions, we anticipate a strong third quarter, but lower than the prior year as wheat milling margins moderate off elevated levels. Network optimization and operational excellence will continue to support strong earnings in the second half. We anticipate solid demand for ethanol both domestically and in the export markets, and upside opportunities could be presented if fundamentals hold. In Nutrition, we expect the third quarter to be higher than the prior year period. The team is systematically optimizing the organizational and operational structure across both Human and Animal Nutrition, which are expected to continue to yield cost benefits throughout the year. Coupling this with our efforts to convert pipeline opportunities and drive improved volumes, we anticipate to see continued sequential improvement in the Nutrition business throughout the year. Turning to slide 14 to discuss our full year guidance assumptions. We anticipated increased crop production in South America would lead to lower margins across the AS&O segment in 2024. And the global soybean crush margins would likely be in the range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton for the year, with performance around the midpoint determined by the strength of soybean meal and oil demand. Though the larger crop production in South America did materialize, we experienced slower than average farmers selling in that region, as well as fewer merchandising opportunities in North America through the first half, which weighed negatively on margins in act services. We expect these dynamics to continue to pressure margins in our third quarter. On soybean crush margins, we continue to see robust soybean meal demand based on solid livestock margins and some supply tightness among competing feedstuffs. From the soybean oil side, we expect that as renewable diesel production continues to grow in the second half, the demand for vegetable oil will remain well supported. And with the prospects of a large crop in North America, we perceive increased opportunities for our interior elevator network and processing plants within Oilseeds and Carbohydrates Solutions in the second half. Taking this all together, our expected crush margin remains unchanged from $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton, with recent fundamentals supporting margins above the midpoint. With the first half results largely in line and balancing an improving crush environment with less opportunities and merchandising in the second half, our 2024 earnings per share range remains unchanged. Looking at the other metrics included in our total consolidated guidance, our full year 2024 indications remain unchanged. Back to you, Juan. Yes, thank you for the question. From the point of view of plant protein, we do expect the plants to come online again in Q4, so we will see some of that recovery coming in. I think as we look at the second half, we significantly pulled quite a bit of volume out in 2023 as a result, obviously, of the Decatur East facility, but also, we had in demand fulfillment. So I did report -- we did report a 3% revenue growth, as we look into the second half, we are seeing an acceleration of that, and we expect to grow, to be on track to deliver roughly in the mid-single digit growth when we bring back some of these facilities and demand fulfillment capabilities that we had lost in the second half of \u201823. I'd like to compliment on the Sweeteners & Starches side, as you know, there's been a fairly low corn crop in Mexico, and that has certainly helped with exports of sweetener and starches products into Mexico. So it's created a demand pool into Mexico that has helped the overall market structure for our business in North America. Yes. I think CapEx is always, the prioritization of CapEx is always NDE, so maintenance and safety and quality we do first. So whatever the plants need at any point in time. So that's a bottom up, roll up of their respective needs. Then we fill it up with cost projects, which the execution excellence challenge that we have to deliver $500 million and bring in more ideas, some of those ideas require CapEx. So you can see that growing and then there are growth projects around the world. So I would say nothing specifically is a little bit of everybody else executing on their plans. So I would say nothing. There is a little bit of CapEx inflation as well in our numbers because things are a little bit more expensive than maybe they were two years ago."

        "content": "Megan Britt: Hello and welcome to ADM's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Juan Luciano, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Ismael Roig, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks on the call today, which are posted on the investor relations section of the ADM website and through the link to our webcast. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance, and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risk and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Megan. Today, ADM reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.46, adjusted segment operated profits of $1.3 billion, and a trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC of 11.2%. Our first quarter operating cash flow before working capital was $900 million. In a year where the buildup of grain and oil seeds supply is expected to create pressure on margins, our teams are proactively taking action to manage through the cycle, driving structural earnings, ROIC, and cash flow generation. Our strong performance and disciplined management of our balance sheet continue to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. Next slide, please. Last month, we laid out three priorities for value creation in 2024. One, managing through the cycle. Two, nutrition recovery. And three, enhanced return of cash to shareholders. We made progress on each of these priorities in the first quarter. Our efforts to manage through the cycle highlight ADM's ability to mitigate challenging headwinds while building structurally on enduring global trends, such as sustainability. To share a few examples of progress in the first quarter, we have been ramping up production at our Green Bison joint venture with Marathon, with increased volumes and utilization in [indiscernible]. And we're expecting to be at sustained full run rates for harvest this fall. We're continuing to evolve the carbohydrate solutions business through decarbonization, driving nearly 10% volume growth in bio solutions in Q1, while managing solid demand across the core business. Driven by increasing demand for sustainable resource feedstocks and solutions, we are announcing today that we're not only exceeded our 2023 goal of 2 million acres in our regenerative ag programs, we have also increased our 2025 acreage goal from 4 million to 5 million acres. This growth highlights the leadership role ADM is playing across the regenerative ag landscape, which is built upon the longstanding relationships we have with our more than 200,000 farmers partners. The Drive for Excellence program is focused on uncovering efficiency and effectiveness opportunities across ADM, taking action to improve outcomes and deliver cost savings. To-date, we have generated a pipeline of nearly 1,200 validated proposals. Many of these are already delivering results. For example, colleagues in Thailand had developed Chatbot to automate processing of thousands of logistic transactions previously done with a manual process, reducing errors and dramatically improving operating performance. Colleagues in Spain have released capacity in our Valencia extract facility by more than 35% by adjusting the extraction time. These projects and more like this will support us in achieving our aggressive cost savings objective of $500 million over the next two years. Moving to nutrition, the team is focused on actions across all areas of planned recovery, and we've seen expected sequential improvement coming out of the fourth quarter. The impact of these actions will accelerate in the back half of the year, consistent with what we mentioned in the last earnings call. Let me provide a few examples of progress we're making across the targeted areas. Our focus on operations and supply chain has helped us debottleneck some of our demand fulfillment challenges, particularly in EMEA Flavors, where the team has rallied to adjust our fulfillment processes following the go-live of 1ADM and improved volumes delivered sequentially. We're leveraging our improved M&A playbook to support the integration of our most recent Flavor acquisitions and now forecast better results than the initial deal model estimates. To increase speed, agility, and responsiveness to customer needs while delivering more wins across each market segment, we have fine-tuned our go-to-market and COE organizations to best align to demand. Looking to our capital allocation efforts, we have maintained our balanced capital allocation approach while leveraging excess cash flow for enhanced returns to shareholders. We returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders to date as we repurchased more than 20 million shares. As mentioned last month, our focus for excess capital deployment will remain centered on the shareholders. In summary, we are making measurable progress across each of our three major priority areas in 2024, which is setting us up well to navigate the market headwinds we are facing this year and delivering in line with our expectations. I would now like to turn the call over to Ismael for more detail on the first quarter financial results. Ismael?\nIsmael Roig: Thank you, Juan. Let's start on Slide six, which provides overall segment operating profit and EPS for the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a 24% decrease versus the prior year. At a high level, operating profit was primarily down year-over-year in ag services and oil seeds and nutrition. In the other segment, which includes ADMIS and Captive Insurance, we had a 25% increase in operating profit. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.46 for the quarter. Lower pricing and execution margins primarily driven by margin normalization in the AS&O business led to a $1 per share decrease. This includes lower mark-to-market impact in AS&O of approximately $0.38 per share. Our enhanced focus on operational excellence and improving the reliability of our assets, as well as the ramp-up of our Green Bison JV, led to volume improvement in the AS&O segment, resulting in a $0.20 per share increase in EPS versus the prior year. Lower manufacturing costs and input costs led to a $0.15 per share increase versus the prior year, partially offset by negative impacts associated with unplanned downtime at our Decatur East facility. Higher equity earnings, primarily related to Wilmar, attributed a $0.07 per share increase versus the prior year. Increased corporate costs related to the 1ADM implementation and legal fees drove a decrease of $0.11 per share versus the prior year. In other, benefits from share repurchases more than offset negative impacts related to a higher adjusted income tax rate, leading to a $0.06 per share increase versus the prior year. Moving to Slide seven, let's look at our segment performance for AS&O. For the first quarter, the AS&O team delivered $864 million in operating profit, reflecting increasing headwinds from lower commodity prices and ample supplies, partially offset by improvements in process volumes and manufacturing costs, as we enhanced our focus on items within our control. The Ag Services subsegment operating profit was lower versus the prior year, primarily due to the stabilization of trade flows leading to lower global trade and risk management results. Slower farmer selling also negatively impacted export volumes and margins in South America. Crushing subsegment operating profit for the quarter of $232 million was lower versus the prior year. Increased imports of used cooking oil and the anticipation of large South American supplies negatively impacted North American soy crush margins, more than offsetting the benefits from improved process volumes and lower manufacturing costs. There were positive mark-to-market timing impacts during the quarter of approximately $40 million versus positive timing impacts of approximately $240 million in the first quarter of 2023. Refined products and other subsegment results were $157 million. Results were driven by weaker North American refining margins due to the increased imports of used cooking oil, as well as negative mark-to-market timing impacts of approximately $30 million versus positive impacts of approximately $40 million in the prior year. Equity earnings from Willmar were $149 million during the first quarter, higher than the prior year. Moving to Slide eight, let's look at carbohydrate solutions. For the first quarter of 2024, carbohydrate solution segment operating profit was $248 million. The team executed well in a solid demand environment, as well as advance our BioSolutions platform with strong volume growth. Turning to the subsegments. In the starches and sweeteners subsegment, strong starches and sweeteners margins in North America were offset by pressured domestic ethanol margins due to strong industry production and elevated stocks, as well as moderating margins in the EMEA region. In the vantage corn processing subsegment, strong export demand for sustainably certified ethanol supported both volumes and improved margins, leading to an improvement in year-over-year results. Please turn to Slide nine. Nutrition revenues were $1.8 billion for the quarter. In the human nutrition subsegment, strong M&A revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions, as well as price and mixed benefits in flavors, were partially offset by lower volumes in plant-based proteins and normalizing pricing in the texturants markets. Our animal nutrition subsegment had lower revenues versus the prior year, driven by lower pricing and mix. Demand creation has remained strong and provided significant revenue pipeline opportunities. We anticipate steady improvement in demand fulfillment throughout the course of the year, recovering a significant portion of volumes in the second half of the year. Please turn to Slide 10. While we have room to go on our commitment to restore the growth trajectory of the nutrition business, we believe Q1 was an important first step, showing sequential improvement from a challenged fourth quarter, evidencing progress in our operations. For the first quarter, nutrition segment operating profit was $84 million. Human nutrition subsegment results of $76 million were lower than the prior year, driven primarily from headwinds in the specialty ingredients business due to higher fixed cost absorption at Decatur East and normalizing texturants pricing. Animal nutrition subsegment results of $8 million were higher compared to the prior year, primarily driven by cost optimization efforts and lower commodity prices supporting margins. Please turn to Slide 11. For the first quarter, other segment operating profit was $121 million, up 25% compared to the prior year. The improvement was largely driven by improved Captive Insurance results on higher program premiums and lower claim losses. In corporate, unallocated corporate costs increased versus the prior year on higher global technology investments to support digital transformation efforts, as well as increased legal fees. Other corporate was unfavorable compared to the prior year due to an investment valuation loss of approximately $18 million. Please turn to Slide 12. With healthy cash flows and a strong balance sheet, we have maintained our balanced capital allocation approach while leveraging excess cash flow for enhanced returns to shareholders. We entered 2024 with momentum, which has allowed us to return $1.3 billion to shareholders via repurchases during the quarter, with $1 billion being executed through an accelerated share repurchase program. We intend to actualize the additional $1 billion of share repurchases approved last quarter throughout the remainder of the year. We still anticipate capital expenditures will be held at a level aligned with depreciation and amortization, focused largely on investments to secure reliability of asset performance through modernization and digitization efforts. Now, let's transition to a discussion on our full year guidance on Slide 13. Our first quarter results were largely in line with expectations, and in turn, our 2024 planning assumptions and EPS guidance remain unchanged. We are raising our corporate net interest expense guidance from approximately $500 million to approximately $525 million, as the Federal Reserve has signaled that the probability of interest rate cuts in 2024 has decreased. Last month, we mentioned that the global grain and oil seeds supply is expected to increase as anticipated improvements in weather would support larger production levels in key South American countries. With this, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to ease from the recent highs of the past two years and that trade flows will adjust at the dislocations. As a result, we anticipate the global soybean crush margins would moderate in 2024, likely moving into a range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton. During the first quarter, the team executed well on a strong forward book supported by meal demand, leading to executed soy crush margins of approximately $55 per metric ton. As we look today, we see that the forward curves reflect the assumption of ample South American supplies and the return of Argentinian production, specifically in Q2 and Q3. While the supply side certainly has pushed forward curves to the lower end of that range in the near term, we remain constructive from the demand side. We continue to expect vegetable oil demand growth from renewable diesel as large facilities ramp up in Q2 and Q3, despite the increase in imports of used cooking oil. From the soybean meal side, lower soybean meal prices are incentivizing demand, supporting producer profitability and, in turn, leading to higher inclusion rates. Now moving to the breakdown of expectations by segment for Q2 2024 on Slide 14. In AS&O, we anticipate the second quarter to be significantly lower versus elevated prior year levels. We anticipate our average global soy crush margin to be towards the lower end of the guided range during the second quarter as the market balances strong soybean availability against increased crush capacity. We still remain confident in our full year planning assumptions as we move through the seasonally lower middle of the year as the world pivots to South American production. In carbohydrate solutions, we anticipate the second quarter to be higher versus the prior year, driven by solid demand and margins in North American starches and sweeteners, partially offset by moderating margins in wheat milling and international corn milling after elevated results in the prior year period. We anticipate solid demand for ethanol, both domestically and in the export markets, similar to the prior year. For nutrition, the second quarter is expected to be lower versus the prior year as we face headwinds in specialty ingredients. We anticipate to see another quarter of sequential improvement as we continue to make progress in demand fulfillment. Back to you, Juan.\nJuan Luciano: Thank you, Ismael. Please turn to Slide 15. As you can see, our team is continuing to improve execution excellence across our strategic and operational priorities, which requires a level of agility that is a hallmark of ADM's workforce. We're focusing the organization on a combination of productivity and innovation to help offset increasingly challenging market conditions based on growing commodity supply. Our teams are looking for every opportunity to manage what we can control, remaining nimble to adjust quickly to external circumstances while advancing our strategy. When we look ahead to the rest of the year, our business priorities in 2024 put us in a position to manage through this cycle. Through the differentiation and evolution of our business models in ag services and oil seeds and carb solutions, our drive for excellence program, the recovery of our nutrition business, and continued focus on shareholder returns, we have confidence in our outlook for the full year. Thanks for your time today. We look forward to taking your questions. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO. Andrew, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Strelzik: I guess I wanted to ask about the interplay. I wanted to ask about the interplay between US and South America crops and timing and farmer selling in terms of the implications for crush margins and how you're thinking about that. It seems like we've got some delayed farmer selling out of South America that could push out the timing to which that crop comes to market. And so I guess I'm just curious how you're thinking about the balance there and ultimately kind of the confidence that you have as we get into the back part of the year that you see crush margins consistent with your expectations. Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So what we're seeing in South America at the moment, Brazil has had a little bit of a better selling last couple of weeks from the farmer perspective, given that with the harvest and also some of the devaluation of the real. So we've seen the crush margins there for Q2 improving a little bit around our portfolio of products. In Argentina, a little bit more difficult to read, Argentina with the economic plans and the uncertainty about how the government navigates through the difficult times. There are also a lot of, even when the farmer may agree to sell, there are some strikes, like right now, there are some strikes in Argentina that are popping through every sector of the economy. So a little bit more difficult to predict, but the reality is all that crop will come to the market. And we're starting to see that in crush margins, and you can see that. So what Ismael was reading in his remark is that, we highlighted a range of crush for the year. We operated in the first quarter, mostly in the higher part of that range, we will move in the second and third quarter, as traditionally happened when South America has a big crop, toward the low end of that range. And then we see at the end of the year, September onward, when we have a crop here in the U.S., where our margins will recover. So that's the way we see the year. We continue to see a strong meal demand as soybean meal becomes cheaper, and it gets more favor in the inclusions, especially when we see some maybe bottom out of profitability from the poultry sector. So that bodes well for our demand. And we have new RGD plants coming in on the stream in the U.S., whether it's Q2 or Q4, that will bring like another half a million ton more of soybean oil demand for the U.S. And don't forget that Brazil increased their mandate to B14, which represents another half a million tons of soybean oil. So all in all, I think that all that oil demand and meal demand will be important to bring back crush margins to the higher part of the range at the end of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBen Bienvenu: So I want to ask in the carbohydrate solution segment, you point to a pretty robust outlook for the remainder of the year for starches and sweeteners. In particular, you call out strong volumes. That's a bit of a recovery from what we saw last year. Can you talk about some of the dynamics that you're seeing around volume and the pace of recovery that you're seeing in volume that makes you call out this year?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I would say we've seen strong demand, I would say, I don't know, strong or solid demand across all our segments. Margins have been good. We continue to get a lift on margins by the reduction in chemicals, the reduction in energy prices, a little bit better operations of our facilities. And I would say the main difference maybe versus last year was the last year we have exceptional margins in international milling and also in the corn business in Europe. Those have moderated a little bit, but still the business remained very strong. So I would say all the sweeteners and starches contracted for the year, we're pleased with it. And we expect strong exports to Mexico, other countries pulling well. So I would say, we feel strongly about having a Q2 that's going to be better than last year. So all in all, the uncertainty continues to stay on the ethanol side in which we are cautiously optimistic that, the maintenance systems will balance inventories, if you will, and lift a little bit of margins there. But for the rest of the business, rest of the business is operating very solidly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTom Palmer: I wanted to maybe dive in a little more on refined products. You noted lower biodiesel margin expectations for the year and then in prepared remarks and pressure from imported used cooking oil. I guess, what do you see on more of a regional basis when we think about those refined spreads and more pressured U.S. and other places? And then you did have some timing gains a year ago. We saw a bit of an unwind in 1Q. Just any help on the expected progression of those as we move through 2024? Thanks.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. So let me deconstruct a little bit the RPO part. The difference in Q1, so results were lower significantly than last year where we had the record year. Main reason for that is North America, as you described, the imports of used cooking oil negatively impacted North America refining margins. Actually, in EMEA, our results were higher. We executed on the strong biodiesel margins. And I would say refining there is in line with the prior year. I would say we have additional volumes that offset a little bit lower refining premiums. South American results in biodiesel and packages, margins are stronger in the current year, supported by, as I said, increased biodiesel mandate. That's half a million tons per year of new demand that really impacted that. So overall, I think the dynamic will be similar for second quarter in which you will see refining margins lower in North America and crush margins and refining margins a little bit better in South America.\nTom Palmer: Thanks. And just any help on the timing, Juan?\nJuan Luciano: Oh, yes. Well, year-over-year, there was a $72 million negative of net timing impacts in Q1. So we had a negative mark-to-market this quarter of $30 million versus the previous year where we had a positive of 42. So that's the arithmetics, if you will, of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Gupta of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nManav Gupta: Good morning. My only question is, can you provide the path to the full restart of the Decatur East plant? Like where are we in the restart regulatory or construction, if you could help us out with that? Thank you very much.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, Manav. Good morning. Listen, there's a lot of activity going on there. But we have said, I think this is something we've got nutrition is going to carry as a headwind during the whole year. We expect that plant reasonably to be operating in Q4. I cannot provide any more details or granularity on that as we're going through all the projects, but I would say as soon as we have more specifics, we will be updating all you guys on that. But at this point in time, I think you need to think that the headwinds for nutrition in specialty ingredients and a lot of that driven by this will carry through the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nHeather Jones: I was just hoping you could help me. I just want to discuss the crush margin outlook a little more specifically on the soy side. So thank you for the cadence information you provided earlier. But I just wanted to dig in a little bit more. So at present, the curve for the U.S. has margins below the range. And then on a cash basis, in certain regions, they're materially below that 35. So when I think about the rest of the year, are y'all assuming that regions like Brazil and Europe are going to provide a material uplift to offset the U.S.? Or is it you think the increased soybean oil demand, et cetera., will make U.S. margins materially better than the curve is indicating at present? So just trying to think about how you all are thinking about that.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Heather, good to hear from you. Listen, the way we're seeing it at the moment, so North America, as we said, Q2 and probably Q3 will move to the lower part of the range. Then as we come through the year and we get more beans here in the U.S. and we get more renewable green diesel volume coming from probably 1 billion gallon more of capacity that's coming, we think that, that and inclusion rates will drive Q4 higher. In the Q2, Q3 area, if you will, we see right now, crush margins in Brazil have gotten better across all our plants, not only the domestic ones, but also the export ones. So as the farmer has been selling a little bit more, as you get more through the harvest there in Latin America, farmers start to move a little bit more volume. In Brazil, it was helped by the devaluation. So we saw that easing the pressure that we have in getting beans and helping crush margins. Europe, we expect it to be around $40 per ton, so it's a little bit in the middle of the pack. China, we don't have a lot of visibility in China, but it seems to be very spot in China at the moment. So it's a little bit hand to mouth over there. So in general, as I said, we see for ADM, at least, a big correction going into the second quarter, also a soft third quarter, and then we start to see coming back up in the Q4. But mostly, the curve of the U.S., if you will, with a little bit moderation provided by the other areas.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSalvator Tiano: I wanted to ask a little bit about ethanol. And specifically, it seems like your commentary on ethanol was a little bit different between starches and sweeteners and VCP. It seems like you talked about lower ethanol margins in the former and better ethanol demand margins, et cetera, in VCP. So can you clarify why this, I guess, ethanol margins from the 2 different types of mills diverged? And also specifically, what are you seeing on the ethanol export front, and why is that benefiting VCP more than Starches and Sweeteners?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. The reference we made to that is because VCP results were helped by stronger export demand for sustainably certified ethanol, and we get a premium for sustainably certified ethanol. So that supported volumes and margins. In general, Salvator, ethanol is a very cheap oxygenate, so it's getting a lot of demand from the rest of the world. So exports are expected to be north of 1.5 billion gallons. And blending demand inside the U.S. domestically has been good. It's just that this is the time of the year in which the plants have produced a lot. I always said the plants are exothermic. So in a time of cold temperature, they produce a lot, and that's a time where we drive the least. So now we're going into more the maintenance period of those plants. And I think that inventories for the industry, we hope will come a little bit more into balance, and we expect that to higher driving miles during the summer to balance margins a little bit better. But we expect for the whole year for exports to remain very healthy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Just wanted to follow up on some of the initiatives you're doing within the Nutrition business. And Juan, you talked about it at the beginning as it relates to like just simplification, portfolio optimization. So as you've looked through the assets and obviously, it's been volatile here and somewhat soft, obviously impacted by some of the onetime items. But as you think about Nutrition going forward and past some of the issues with the plant downtime, et cetera. How do you want to structure this business? Where do you want to take it to? What do you think is going to be the Nutrition, call it, maybe 2.0 version in 2 to 3 years time? What's the contribution, animal, human? How should we think about this?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Good question. Listen, if you see the sequential improvement that we have had right now, is we're taking a lot of the one-offs we received last year or even in Q4 out of the picture, if you will. Some of them completely. Some of them, they're going to continue to improve as the business improve the reliability of our supply, if you will. I would say, in the short-term, you need to be able to see through some of the headwinds that we will get in revenue because of the correction of raw materials. So there are some parts of the Nutrition business, what we call Specialty Ingredients, if you will, that were either related to proteins or emulsifiers. Those things tend to correct revenue because they are related to soy or corn at the end of the day, so they moderate. And that business is a business that from a volume perspective, there is a reshuffle of the demand in terms of plant-based proteins. And there's a lot of exciting stuff that the industry is doing. Listen, there is a lot of emerging technologies, novel ingredients and new culinary techniques that will come to revitalize that demand over time, but that's a shift that we're going through and you're not going to see that in 2024. But that's something that, long term, we still believe in that piece. Right now, in the present time, flavor, we continue to see strong demand for flavor, whether it's in North America or whether it's in Europe. To the extent that we can release our supply constraints, we will be able to capitalize more on that. And U.S. has been doing better, faster than maybe Europe, and we're correcting those things in Europe but we feel strongly about that. On the Health & Wellness perspective, biotics continues to excel. Biotics have increased OP by like 100% in the first quarter. So we're doing very well. We're getting some headwinds from the fibers perspective, but I think that's a matter of competitive materials. But over time, fibers has a very positive prognosis as all of us are trying to incorporate more protein and fibers in our diet and reduce fats and sugar that's where the world nutrition trends are moving. And then when you think about the Animal Nutrition side, Animal Nutrition is probably the most undervalued, if you will, story given their potential. Because we are doing a lot of self-help, and that self-help continues to be seen in the P&L. But some of the protein sector issues have impacted the demand there. I would say there in the Animal Nutrition area is where we're probably going to see more of the refinement of the portfolio, if you will, just because there are unevenness across sectors in terms of our ability to achieve the right returns on the long-term. So in some part of the sectors, it's more like self-help. In other parts, it's more innovation driven. And even if you go to things like pet, where the demand is very strong, there are pieces of the world that are doing exceptionally well for us like Mexico. There are pieces where demand is very strong, like in North America, so maybe we need to fix some supply issues. And there are parts of the world, like maybe like South America, where structurally it becomes a little bit more difficult to make money. So we are applying different recipes to the different parts of the world. But I still see a very complete Nutrition business, if you will, going forward, more focus on the maybe fewer platforms, fewer customers to be able to execute our pipeline faster. Maybe in the past, we have a big pipeline with a percentage of conversion that we expect it to be higher on a maybe a more focused, concentrated pipeline. That's the way I tend to think about it.\nIsmael Roig: Can I offer a complementary view? I just wanted to offer you a complementary view on Juan's comments with regard to Animal Nutrition, but I think it also applies to the broader portfolio, which is I fully agree with Juan in the sense that the base business in Animal Nutrition is now experiencing the benefits of the cost improvement programs that we put in place, and we've seen that evolution quarter-on-quarter. But to Juan's observations on a going-forward basis, you will see a business that is looking to become more focused on the specialty side of its portfolio. As Juan alluded to at the beginning, part of the revenue calculation for the platform is partly impacted by the fact that there is a soy mill commodity component to some of the products that are produced. Over time, it's a business that will evolve to become more specialty focused, more higher margin focused. I think it bodes well for the growth and margin structure of that business as we look forward into 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSteven Haynes: Maybe just two quick follow-ups on Nutrition. So I think your income was down slightly and based on your kind of prior comments about there being some price component, were your volumes, I guess, organic volumes, positive in the quarter? That would be the first one. And then the second question is on the full year, you mentioned that the recent M&A is kind of coming in ahead of your kind of deal model expectations. How much operating profit contribution are you baking into the full year guide from M&A? Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Steven. So let me tell me that we are very pleased with the 2 M&As. The 2 M&As contributed to revenue in the first quarter and not yet to OP because of start-up costs and all that. But we still expect revenue, even despite the headwinds that I mentioned before relative to commodity prices, moderating in some of our less specialty categories. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of mid-single digit for full year. We expect probably operating profit to be a little bit better than that given that our cost should be down year-over-year. So what was the other question there?\nIsmael Roig: Yes. So in terms of overall volume, volume was a complementary question. Overall, we've seen volume hold up well. The exception to that would be, obviously, the Specialty Ingredients business and specifically, the impacts of the Decatur East plant. But all of the other elements of our business have generally performed well volume-wise. So you've seen a bit of a deterioration of the volume on a revenue basis, but you have seen a general improvement except for the SI business when it came to volume.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: So I guess I got two questions. Maybe first, as we think about the outlook for the year where you talked about improvement in soy meal demand and inclusion ratios later in the year. Can you maybe help us be a bit more specific? Just that doesn't seem to you as implied by the curves. Most forecasts on poultry supply in different parts of the world don't really project a sizable uptick in production. So could you just help us a little bit on the areas where you're actually seeing that or getting that signal from your feed customers? And then an unrelated question, as I think about some of the cost actions and productivity savings that you've targeted for this year and next. Would love if you could maybe a bit more specificity to the areas where the $500 million are really coming from, both in terms of the category of spend, but also whether they're in the operating segments or in corporate unallocated as we think about the outlook for the next couple of years. Thank you.\nJuan Luciano: Yes, sure. Adam, listen, I think what you need to realize, so first of all, we are early in the year, of course, and we are making predictions on Q4. So this is a transition period for the industry, if you will. We're going from a couple of years of tight supplies to ample supplies. So we're seeing here a customer base that is very uncovered, if you will, farmer selling that is a little slow. And we're going to go through that transition. On top of that, you have a proteins industry that was in the unprofitable territory, if you will, and still is for certain for, if you will, beef or some parts of pork, but now it seemed to have based and seeing growth trends in poultry. So we see that in different parts of the world, whether it's in Thailand, in Turkey, in other parts of the world. But I think the main issue is that pricing is doing its effect. So you see some trade flows changing. We see some soybean oil being exported out of the U.S., as we see used cooking oil coming into the U.S. We're starting to see maybe Brazil becoming less of an exporter of soybean oil, maybe more competition in mills, but the U.S. is still very competitive in mill. So I think that we will have to see all that shift during the year. What we are seeing is we're looking at our customers, we're looking at our book. And we just think that, again, with 1 billion gallon more of RGD capacity in the U.S. with 500,000 tons more soybean oil coming from the biodiesel mandate in Brazil, that will be a very big determinant of crush margins for the year. With that, I think Ismael will cover the drive for excellence profitability.\nIsmael Roig: Yes. Adam, on the drive for excellence, we're actually quite encouraged by the progress. As Juan mentioned during the remarks, we have more than 1,200 initiatives, but they can be grouped into substantial areas or themes of effort and focus, working on plant process optimization, working on business process optimization, also very important on supply chain and demand fulfillment , which is part of the challenges that we've had in Nutrition. So these would be the large buckets that we're working on. And we've seen the platform progress very well. And we have at least about 1/3rd line of sight of the $500 million already for 2024. So we're very encouraged about the ability of this drive for excellence impacting 2024 already in the measures that I've just outlined.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Kallo of Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBen Kallo: Just how do we think about or you think about the dynamic of the blenders tax credit changing over to a producers tax credit and the carbon intensity being a factor for overall soy oil demand in the U.S. next year?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Thank you, Ben, for the question. So as you know, the $1 blenders tax credit will expire at the end of '24 and transition to a production tax credit. And this will be administered by the US Treasury. They issued guidance on, I think, at the end of last year that will allow the use of grid CA modeling in addition to CORSIA. Of course, we favor including grid. We're successful in grid being officially included. We're still delayed in the EPA ruling on that. So I think that we have been doing a lot of advocacy in encouraging government officials to make sure that we remove this uncertainty out of the equation here. I think that a transition without guidance of whether the crop-based biofuels will generate credits will create a very difficult price discovery mechanism in the coming months, as participants are trying to begin locking 2025 volume. So I think that's an important clarification that needs to happen. These are industries that are investing in the U.S., and I think that providing regulatory certainty are very important for those investments to come to fruition on time and as expected.\nBen Kallo: Just a follow-up there. What are you seeing with the renewable diesel refiners, producers in terms of them transitioning to using waste fats or other materials?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Listen, there is a reality in the world that palm oil production is flat and not being able to cope with demand. So we know that the U.S. and renewable green diesel was going to have to be met with a lot of feedstocks, of which soybean oil is an important component. But of course, the industry is trying to gather every kind of feedstock that they can find. And there was inventory of used cooking oil. The U.S. has imported a lot of that, but still is not going to be enough because how much are you going to grow the used cook oil inventory around the world to supply, as I said, an industry is going to have 1 billion gallon more capacity this year. So we still expect that we are adjusting to these temporary imports of used cook oil. But we still expect that soybean oil will recover their percentage of the used from maybe 30% to again, the 40% we used to be.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSalvator Tiano: I just had a follow-up. So as we look a little bit into a couple of items, can you help us understand the Green Bison contribution now? So for example, the process volume growth that you showed, roughly how much came from that? And also, I believe you had the $10 million non-controlling interest loss. Well, I guess, the JV, among others, are the loss. So how much, I guess, of that was the Green Bison JV, and at which point do you expect it to turn into a profitable JV on a net income basis, so for that NCI line?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. Salvator, maybe I give you what I have at the top of my mind. But we were very pleased with the increase in volumes in oilseeds or in crush during the first quarter. It was 9% increase. Part of that was Spiritwood coming online, part of that were our plants improvements in general across the footprint. Part of that was Paraguay and Ukraine also coming to crush. So that all happened at different points in the quarter. So I don't have a full recollection of what happened to what volume at any part of the quarter. The Green Bison joint venture will be a contributor to profit during 2024. So it's ramping up. It's going to get to full capacity very soon. So it will be a meaningful contributor. I don't have top of my head what was the contribution on first quarter, to be honest.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nHeather Jones: Just wanted to ask really quickly what exactly you're doing for the dry mills as far as sustainability sourcing? And the doubling of your region acreage, is that related to like proactively getting ahead of this EU deforestation regime or more stringent carb requirements? Just wondering what's driving that?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. So Heather, in carb solutions, we have a whole decarbonization strategy. Actually, across ADM, we have a decarbonization strategy, driven partly by our Strive 35 goals that we need to decarbonize ourselves, part driven by our customers and the need for either awaiting Scope 3 emissions from the side of our customers, but also by providing some low carbon intensity characteristics of some of our products that has also commanding a premium out there. So what are we doing? We are working on increasing our carbon capture sequestration. We're going to go from 2 wells, 1 well and 1 experimental well, but let's say 2 wells to 7 wells, so we're going to be able to increase significantly our capacity. And let me remind you, we have already captured 4.5 million tons of CO2 in the last 10 years that we've been operating. So that has been successful. For the dry mills specifically, what we're doing is we are building pipelines to bring that to our carbon capture and sequestration units indicator. We have 1 pipeline that has been ongoing, the project, and we are looking for solutions for the other dry mills. So that's what is happening. The second part of the question, Heather, I'm not remembering exactly what...\nHeather Jones: I was just wondering about the region.\nJuan Luciano: Oh, yes.\nHeather Jones: Yes, on the region acreage, just wondering, is that doubling in anticipation of like the EU deforestation regime or more stringent carb standards? Just wondering what's driving that. Or is it all voluntary market-driven growth?\nJuan Luciano: Yes. I would say there is excitement on both sides. There is excitement on the farmer side to adhere to all these practices, but there's also a lot of demand pull from the customer side in terms of we continue to sign contracts for more of these as people need to, again, have an answer to their Scope 3. So we have been setting goals, and we have been beating those goals and increasing those goals. Now we have expanded that to Europe and Latin America, and we continue to see demand for these activities around the world. And to be honest, the team has been doing an excellent job. So I think that this program is perceived as the leading program in the world there.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we currently have no further questions. So I'll hand back to Juan Luciano for any further remarks.\nJuan Luciano : Okay. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your interest in ADM, and have a great day.\nIsmael Roig: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You can now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Megan. Today, ADM reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.46, adjusted segment operated profits of $1.3 billion, and a trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC of 11.2%. Our first quarter operating cash flow before working capital was $900 million. In a year where the buildup of grain and oil seeds supply is expected to create pressure on margins, our teams are proactively taking action to manage through the cycle, driving structural earnings, ROIC, and cash flow generation. Our strong performance and disciplined management of our balance sheet continue to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. Next slide, please. Last month, we laid out three priorities for value creation in 2024. One, managing through the cycle. Two, nutrition recovery. And three, enhanced return of cash to shareholders. We made progress on each of these priorities in the first quarter. Our efforts to manage through the cycle highlight ADM's ability to mitigate challenging headwinds while building structurally on enduring global trends, such as sustainability. To share a few examples of progress in the first quarter, we have been ramping up production at our Green Bison joint venture with Marathon, with increased volumes and utilization in [indiscernible]. And we're expecting to be at sustained full run rates for harvest this fall. We're continuing to evolve the carbohydrate solutions business through decarbonization, driving nearly 10% volume growth in bio solutions in Q1, while managing solid demand across the core business. Driven by increasing demand for sustainable resource feedstocks and solutions, we are announcing today that we're not only exceeded our 2023 goal of 2 million acres in our regenerative ag programs, we have also increased our 2025 acreage goal from 4 million to 5 million acres. This growth highlights the leadership role ADM is playing across the regenerative ag landscape, which is built upon the longstanding relationships we have with our more than 200,000 farmers partners. The Drive for Excellence program is focused on uncovering efficiency and effectiveness opportunities across ADM, taking action to improve outcomes and deliver cost savings. To-date, we have generated a pipeline of nearly 1,200 validated proposals. Many of these are already delivering results. For example, colleagues in Thailand had developed Chatbot to automate processing of thousands of logistic transactions previously done with a manual process, reducing errors and dramatically improving operating performance. Colleagues in Spain have released capacity in our Valencia extract facility by more than 35% by adjusting the extraction time. These projects and more like this will support us in achieving our aggressive cost savings objective of $500 million over the next two years. Moving to nutrition, the team is focused on actions across all areas of planned recovery, and we've seen expected sequential improvement coming out of the fourth quarter. The impact of these actions will accelerate in the back half of the year, consistent with what we mentioned in the last earnings call. Let me provide a few examples of progress we're making across the targeted areas. Our focus on operations and supply chain has helped us debottleneck some of our demand fulfillment challenges, particularly in EMEA Flavors, where the team has rallied to adjust our fulfillment processes following the go-live of 1ADM and improved volumes delivered sequentially. We're leveraging our improved M&A playbook to support the integration of our most recent Flavor acquisitions and now forecast better results than the initial deal model estimates. To increase speed, agility, and responsiveness to customer needs while delivering more wins across each market segment, we have fine-tuned our go-to-market and COE organizations to best align to demand. Looking to our capital allocation efforts, we have maintained our balanced capital allocation approach while leveraging excess cash flow for enhanced returns to shareholders. We returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders to date as we repurchased more than 20 million shares. As mentioned last month, our focus for excess capital deployment will remain centered on the shareholders. In summary, we are making measurable progress across each of our three major priority areas in 2024, which is setting us up well to navigate the market headwinds we are facing this year and delivering in line with our expectations. I would now like to turn the call over to Ismael for more detail on the first quarter financial results. Ismael? Thank you, Ismael. Please turn to Slide 15. As you can see, our team is continuing to improve execution excellence across our strategic and operational priorities, which requires a level of agility that is a hallmark of ADM's workforce. We're focusing the organization on a combination of productivity and innovation to help offset increasingly challenging market conditions based on growing commodity supply. Our teams are looking for every opportunity to manage what we can control, remaining nimble to adjust quickly to external circumstances while advancing our strategy. When we look ahead to the rest of the year, our business priorities in 2024 put us in a position to manage through this cycle. Through the differentiation and evolution of our business models in ag services and oil seeds and carb solutions, our drive for excellence program, the recovery of our nutrition business, and continued focus on shareholder returns, we have confidence in our outlook for the full year. Thanks for your time today. We look forward to taking your questions. Operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So what we're seeing in South America at the moment, Brazil has had a little bit of a better selling last couple of weeks from the farmer perspective, given that with the harvest and also some of the devaluation of the real. So we've seen the crush margins there for Q2 improving a little bit around our portfolio of products. In Argentina, a little bit more difficult to read, Argentina with the economic plans and the uncertainty about how the government navigates through the difficult times. There are also a lot of, even when the farmer may agree to sell, there are some strikes, like right now, there are some strikes in Argentina that are popping through every sector of the economy. So a little bit more difficult to predict, but the reality is all that crop will come to the market. And we're starting to see that in crush margins, and you can see that. So what Ismael was reading in his remark is that, we highlighted a range of crush for the year. We operated in the first quarter, mostly in the higher part of that range, we will move in the second and third quarter, as traditionally happened when South America has a big crop, toward the low end of that range. And then we see at the end of the year, September onward, when we have a crop here in the U.S., where our margins will recover. So that's the way we see the year. We continue to see a strong meal demand as soybean meal becomes cheaper, and it gets more favor in the inclusions, especially when we see some maybe bottom out of profitability from the poultry sector. So that bodes well for our demand. And we have new RGD plants coming in on the stream in the U.S., whether it's Q2 or Q4, that will bring like another half a million ton more of soybean oil demand for the U.S. And don't forget that Brazil increased their mandate to B14, which represents another half a million tons of soybean oil. So all in all, I think that all that oil demand and meal demand will be important to bring back crush margins to the higher part of the range at the end of the year. Yes. I would say we've seen strong demand, I would say, I don't know, strong or solid demand across all our segments. Margins have been good. We continue to get a lift on margins by the reduction in chemicals, the reduction in energy prices, a little bit better operations of our facilities. And I would say the main difference maybe versus last year was the last year we have exceptional margins in international milling and also in the corn business in Europe. Those have moderated a little bit, but still the business remained very strong. So I would say all the sweeteners and starches contracted for the year, we're pleased with it. And we expect strong exports to Mexico, other countries pulling well. So I would say, we feel strongly about having a Q2 that's going to be better than last year. So all in all, the uncertainty continues to stay on the ethanol side in which we are cautiously optimistic that, the maintenance systems will balance inventories, if you will, and lift a little bit of margins there. But for the rest of the business, rest of the business is operating very solidly. Yes. So let me deconstruct a little bit the RPO part. The difference in Q1, so results were lower significantly than last year where we had the record year. Main reason for that is North America, as you described, the imports of used cooking oil negatively impacted North America refining margins. Actually, in EMEA, our results were higher. We executed on the strong biodiesel margins. And I would say refining there is in line with the prior year. I would say we have additional volumes that offset a little bit lower refining premiums. South American results in biodiesel and packages, margins are stronger in the current year, supported by, as I said, increased biodiesel mandate. That's half a million tons per year of new demand that really impacted that. So overall, I think the dynamic will be similar for second quarter in which you will see refining margins lower in North America and crush margins and refining margins a little bit better in South America. Oh, yes. Well, year-over-year, there was a $72 million negative of net timing impacts in Q1. So we had a negative mark-to-market this quarter of $30 million versus the previous year where we had a positive of 42. So that's the arithmetics, if you will, of that. Yes, Manav. Good morning. Listen, there's a lot of activity going on there. But we have said, I think this is something we've got nutrition is going to carry as a headwind during the whole year. We expect that plant reasonably to be operating in Q4. I cannot provide any more details or granularity on that as we're going through all the projects, but I would say as soon as we have more specifics, we will be updating all you guys on that. But at this point in time, I think you need to think that the headwinds for nutrition in specialty ingredients and a lot of that driven by this will carry through the year. Yes. Heather, good to hear from you. Listen, the way we're seeing it at the moment, so North America, as we said, Q2 and probably Q3 will move to the lower part of the range. Then as we come through the year and we get more beans here in the U.S. and we get more renewable green diesel volume coming from probably 1 billion gallon more of capacity that's coming, we think that, that and inclusion rates will drive Q4 higher. In the Q2, Q3 area, if you will, we see right now, crush margins in Brazil have gotten better across all our plants, not only the domestic ones, but also the export ones. So as the farmer has been selling a little bit more, as you get more through the harvest there in Latin America, farmers start to move a little bit more volume. In Brazil, it was helped by the devaluation. So we saw that easing the pressure that we have in getting beans and helping crush margins. Europe, we expect it to be around $40 per ton, so it's a little bit in the middle of the pack. China, we don't have a lot of visibility in China, but it seems to be very spot in China at the moment. So it's a little bit hand to mouth over there. So in general, as I said, we see for ADM, at least, a big correction going into the second quarter, also a soft third quarter, and then we start to see coming back up in the Q4. But mostly, the curve of the U.S., if you will, with a little bit moderation provided by the other areas. Yes. The reference we made to that is because VCP results were helped by stronger export demand for sustainably certified ethanol, and we get a premium for sustainably certified ethanol. So that supported volumes and margins. In general, Salvator, ethanol is a very cheap oxygenate, so it's getting a lot of demand from the rest of the world. So exports are expected to be north of 1.5 billion gallons. And blending demand inside the U.S. domestically has been good. It's just that this is the time of the year in which the plants have produced a lot. I always said the plants are exothermic. So in a time of cold temperature, they produce a lot, and that's a time where we drive the least. So now we're going into more the maintenance period of those plants. And I think that inventories for the industry, we hope will come a little bit more into balance, and we expect that to higher driving miles during the summer to balance margins a little bit better. But we expect for the whole year for exports to remain very healthy. Yes. Good question. Listen, if you see the sequential improvement that we have had right now, is we're taking a lot of the one-offs we received last year or even in Q4 out of the picture, if you will. Some of them completely. Some of them, they're going to continue to improve as the business improve the reliability of our supply, if you will. I would say, in the short-term, you need to be able to see through some of the headwinds that we will get in revenue because of the correction of raw materials. So there are some parts of the Nutrition business, what we call Specialty Ingredients, if you will, that were either related to proteins or emulsifiers. Those things tend to correct revenue because they are related to soy or corn at the end of the day, so they moderate. And that business is a business that from a volume perspective, there is a reshuffle of the demand in terms of plant-based proteins. And there's a lot of exciting stuff that the industry is doing. Listen, there is a lot of emerging technologies, novel ingredients and new culinary techniques that will come to revitalize that demand over time, but that's a shift that we're going through and you're not going to see that in 2024. But that's something that, long term, we still believe in that piece. Right now, in the present time, flavor, we continue to see strong demand for flavor, whether it's in North America or whether it's in Europe. To the extent that we can release our supply constraints, we will be able to capitalize more on that. And U.S. has been doing better, faster than maybe Europe, and we're correcting those things in Europe but we feel strongly about that. On the Health & Wellness perspective, biotics continues to excel. Biotics have increased OP by like 100% in the first quarter. So we're doing very well. We're getting some headwinds from the fibers perspective, but I think that's a matter of competitive materials. But over time, fibers has a very positive prognosis as all of us are trying to incorporate more protein and fibers in our diet and reduce fats and sugar that's where the world nutrition trends are moving. And then when you think about the Animal Nutrition side, Animal Nutrition is probably the most undervalued, if you will, story given their potential. Because we are doing a lot of self-help, and that self-help continues to be seen in the P&L. But some of the protein sector issues have impacted the demand there. I would say there in the Animal Nutrition area is where we're probably going to see more of the refinement of the portfolio, if you will, just because there are unevenness across sectors in terms of our ability to achieve the right returns on the long-term. So in some part of the sectors, it's more like self-help. In other parts, it's more innovation driven. And even if you go to things like pet, where the demand is very strong, there are pieces of the world that are doing exceptionally well for us like Mexico. There are pieces where demand is very strong, like in North America, so maybe we need to fix some supply issues. And there are parts of the world, like maybe like South America, where structurally it becomes a little bit more difficult to make money. So we are applying different recipes to the different parts of the world. But I still see a very complete Nutrition business, if you will, going forward, more focus on the maybe fewer platforms, fewer customers to be able to execute our pipeline faster. Maybe in the past, we have a big pipeline with a percentage of conversion that we expect it to be higher on a maybe a more focused, concentrated pipeline. That's the way I tend to think about it. Yes. Thank you, Steven. So let me tell me that we are very pleased with the 2 M&As. The 2 M&As contributed to revenue in the first quarter and not yet to OP because of start-up costs and all that. But we still expect revenue, even despite the headwinds that I mentioned before relative to commodity prices, moderating in some of our less specialty categories. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of mid-single digit for full year. We expect probably operating profit to be a little bit better than that given that our cost should be down year-over-year. So what was the other question there? Yes, sure. Adam, listen, I think what you need to realize, so first of all, we are early in the year, of course, and we are making predictions on Q4. So this is a transition period for the industry, if you will. We're going from a couple of years of tight supplies to ample supplies. So we're seeing here a customer base that is very uncovered, if you will, farmer selling that is a little slow. And we're going to go through that transition. On top of that, you have a proteins industry that was in the unprofitable territory, if you will, and still is for certain for, if you will, beef or some parts of pork, but now it seemed to have based and seeing growth trends in poultry. So we see that in different parts of the world, whether it's in Thailand, in Turkey, in other parts of the world. But I think the main issue is that pricing is doing its effect. So you see some trade flows changing. We see some soybean oil being exported out of the U.S., as we see used cooking oil coming into the U.S. We're starting to see maybe Brazil becoming less of an exporter of soybean oil, maybe more competition in mills, but the U.S. is still very competitive in mill. So I think that we will have to see all that shift during the year. What we are seeing is we're looking at our customers, we're looking at our book. And we just think that, again, with 1 billion gallon more of RGD capacity in the U.S. with 500,000 tons more soybean oil coming from the biodiesel mandate in Brazil, that will be a very big determinant of crush margins for the year. With that, I think Ismael will cover the drive for excellence profitability. Yes. Thank you, Ben, for the question. So as you know, the $1 blenders tax credit will expire at the end of '24 and transition to a production tax credit. And this will be administered by the US Treasury. They issued guidance on, I think, at the end of last year that will allow the use of grid CA modeling in addition to CORSIA. Of course, we favor including grid. We're successful in grid being officially included. We're still delayed in the EPA ruling on that. So I think that we have been doing a lot of advocacy in encouraging government officials to make sure that we remove this uncertainty out of the equation here. I think that a transition without guidance of whether the crop-based biofuels will generate credits will create a very difficult price discovery mechanism in the coming months, as participants are trying to begin locking 2025 volume. So I think that's an important clarification that needs to happen. These are industries that are investing in the U.S., and I think that providing regulatory certainty are very important for those investments to come to fruition on time and as expected. Yes. Listen, there is a reality in the world that palm oil production is flat and not being able to cope with demand. So we know that the U.S. and renewable green diesel was going to have to be met with a lot of feedstocks, of which soybean oil is an important component. But of course, the industry is trying to gather every kind of feedstock that they can find. And there was inventory of used cooking oil. The U.S. has imported a lot of that, but still is not going to be enough because how much are you going to grow the used cook oil inventory around the world to supply, as I said, an industry is going to have 1 billion gallon more capacity this year. So we still expect that we are adjusting to these temporary imports of used cook oil. But we still expect that soybean oil will recover their percentage of the used from maybe 30% to again, the 40% we used to be. Yes. Salvator, maybe I give you what I have at the top of my mind. But we were very pleased with the increase in volumes in oilseeds or in crush during the first quarter. It was 9% increase. Part of that was Spiritwood coming online, part of that were our plants improvements in general across the footprint. Part of that was Paraguay and Ukraine also coming to crush. So that all happened at different points in the quarter. So I don't have a full recollection of what happened to what volume at any part of the quarter. The Green Bison joint venture will be a contributor to profit during 2024. So it's ramping up. It's going to get to full capacity very soon. So it will be a meaningful contributor. I don't have top of my head what was the contribution on first quarter, to be honest. Yes. So Heather, in carb solutions, we have a whole decarbonization strategy. Actually, across ADM, we have a decarbonization strategy, driven partly by our Strive 35 goals that we need to decarbonize ourselves, part driven by our customers and the need for either awaiting Scope 3 emissions from the side of our customers, but also by providing some low carbon intensity characteristics of some of our products that has also commanding a premium out there. So what are we doing? We are working on increasing our carbon capture sequestration. We're going to go from 2 wells, 1 well and 1 experimental well, but let's say 2 wells to 7 wells, so we're going to be able to increase significantly our capacity. And let me remind you, we have already captured 4.5 million tons of CO2 in the last 10 years that we've been operating. So that has been successful. For the dry mills specifically, what we're doing is we are building pipelines to bring that to our carbon capture and sequestration units indicator. We have 1 pipeline that has been ongoing, the project, and we are looking for solutions for the other dry mills. So that's what is happening. The second part of the question, Heather, I'm not remembering exactly what... Oh, yes. Yes. I would say there is excitement on both sides. There is excitement on the farmer side to adhere to all these practices, but there's also a lot of demand pull from the customer side in terms of we continue to sign contracts for more of these as people need to, again, have an answer to their Scope 3. So we have been setting goals, and we have been beating those goals and increasing those goals. Now we have expanded that to Europe and Latin America, and we continue to see demand for these activities around the world. And to be honest, the team has been doing an excellent job. So I think that this program is perceived as the leading program in the world there. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your interest in ADM, and have a great day."

            "name": "Ismael Roig",
            "content": "Thank you, Juan. Let's start on Slide six, which provides overall segment operating profit and EPS for the first quarter of 2024. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a 24% decrease versus the prior year. At a high level, operating profit was primarily down year-over-year in ag services and oil seeds and nutrition. In the other segment, which includes ADMIS and Captive Insurance, we had a 25% increase in operating profit. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.46 for the quarter. Lower pricing and execution margins primarily driven by margin normalization in the AS&O business led to a $1 per share decrease. This includes lower mark-to-market impact in AS&O of approximately $0.38 per share. Our enhanced focus on operational excellence and improving the reliability of our assets, as well as the ramp-up of our Green Bison JV, led to volume improvement in the AS&O segment, resulting in a $0.20 per share increase in EPS versus the prior year. Lower manufacturing costs and input costs led to a $0.15 per share increase versus the prior year, partially offset by negative impacts associated with unplanned downtime at our Decatur East facility. Higher equity earnings, primarily related to Wilmar, attributed a $0.07 per share increase versus the prior year. Increased corporate costs related to the 1ADM implementation and legal fees drove a decrease of $0.11 per share versus the prior year. In other, benefits from share repurchases more than offset negative impacts related to a higher adjusted income tax rate, leading to a $0.06 per share increase versus the prior year. Moving to Slide seven, let's look at our segment performance for AS&O. For the first quarter, the AS&O team delivered $864 million in operating profit, reflecting increasing headwinds from lower commodity prices and ample supplies, partially offset by improvements in process volumes and manufacturing costs, as we enhanced our focus on items within our control. The Ag Services subsegment operating profit was lower versus the prior year, primarily due to the stabilization of trade flows leading to lower global trade and risk management results. Slower farmer selling also negatively impacted export volumes and margins in South America. Crushing subsegment operating profit for the quarter of $232 million was lower versus the prior year. Increased imports of used cooking oil and the anticipation of large South American supplies negatively impacted North American soy crush margins, more than offsetting the benefits from improved process volumes and lower manufacturing costs. There were positive mark-to-market timing impacts during the quarter of approximately $40 million versus positive timing impacts of approximately $240 million in the first quarter of 2023. Refined products and other subsegment results were $157 million. Results were driven by weaker North American refining margins due to the increased imports of used cooking oil, as well as negative mark-to-market timing impacts of approximately $30 million versus positive impacts of approximately $40 million in the prior year. Equity earnings from Willmar were $149 million during the first quarter, higher than the prior year. Moving to Slide eight, let's look at carbohydrate solutions. For the first quarter of 2024, carbohydrate solution segment operating profit was $248 million. The team executed well in a solid demand environment, as well as advance our BioSolutions platform with strong volume growth. Turning to the subsegments. In the starches and sweeteners subsegment, strong starches and sweeteners margins in North America were offset by pressured domestic ethanol margins due to strong industry production and elevated stocks, as well as moderating margins in the EMEA region. In the vantage corn processing subsegment, strong export demand for sustainably certified ethanol supported both volumes and improved margins, leading to an improvement in year-over-year results. Please turn to Slide nine. Nutrition revenues were $1.8 billion for the quarter. In the human nutrition subsegment, strong M&A revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions, as well as price and mixed benefits in flavors, were partially offset by lower volumes in plant-based proteins and normalizing pricing in the texturants markets. Our animal nutrition subsegment had lower revenues versus the prior year, driven by lower pricing and mix. Demand creation has remained strong and provided significant revenue pipeline opportunities. We anticipate steady improvement in demand fulfillment throughout the course of the year, recovering a significant portion of volumes in the second half of the year. Please turn to Slide 10. While we have room to go on our commitment to restore the growth trajectory of the nutrition business, we believe Q1 was an important first step, showing sequential improvement from a challenged fourth quarter, evidencing progress in our operations. For the first quarter, nutrition segment operating profit was $84 million. Human nutrition subsegment results of $76 million were lower than the prior year, driven primarily from headwinds in the specialty ingredients business due to higher fixed cost absorption at Decatur East and normalizing texturants pricing. Animal nutrition subsegment results of $8 million were higher compared to the prior year, primarily driven by cost optimization efforts and lower commodity prices supporting margins. Please turn to Slide 11. For the first quarter, other segment operating profit was $121 million, up 25% compared to the prior year. The improvement was largely driven by improved Captive Insurance results on higher program premiums and lower claim losses. In corporate, unallocated corporate costs increased versus the prior year on higher global technology investments to support digital transformation efforts, as well as increased legal fees. Other corporate was unfavorable compared to the prior year due to an investment valuation loss of approximately $18 million. Please turn to Slide 12. With healthy cash flows and a strong balance sheet, we have maintained our balanced capital allocation approach while leveraging excess cash flow for enhanced returns to shareholders. We entered 2024 with momentum, which has allowed us to return $1.3 billion to shareholders via repurchases during the quarter, with $1 billion being executed through an accelerated share repurchase program. We intend to actualize the additional $1 billion of share repurchases approved last quarter throughout the remainder of the year. We still anticipate capital expenditures will be held at a level aligned with depreciation and amortization, focused largely on investments to secure reliability of asset performance through modernization and digitization efforts. Now, let's transition to a discussion on our full year guidance on Slide 13. Our first quarter results were largely in line with expectations, and in turn, our 2024 planning assumptions and EPS guidance remain unchanged. We are raising our corporate net interest expense guidance from approximately $500 million to approximately $525 million, as the Federal Reserve has signaled that the probability of interest rate cuts in 2024 has decreased. Last month, we mentioned that the global grain and oil seeds supply is expected to increase as anticipated improvements in weather would support larger production levels in key South American countries. With this, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to ease from the recent highs of the past two years and that trade flows will adjust at the dislocations. As a result, we anticipate the global soybean crush margins would moderate in 2024, likely moving into a range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton. During the first quarter, the team executed well on a strong forward book supported by meal demand, leading to executed soy crush margins of approximately $55 per metric ton. As we look today, we see that the forward curves reflect the assumption of ample South American supplies and the return of Argentinian production, specifically in Q2 and Q3. While the supply side certainly has pushed forward curves to the lower end of that range in the near term, we remain constructive from the demand side. We continue to expect vegetable oil demand growth from renewable diesel as large facilities ramp up in Q2 and Q3, despite the increase in imports of used cooking oil. From the soybean meal side, lower soybean meal prices are incentivizing demand, supporting producer profitability and, in turn, leading to higher inclusion rates. Now moving to the breakdown of expectations by segment for Q2 2024 on Slide 14. In AS&O, we anticipate the second quarter to be significantly lower versus elevated prior year levels. We anticipate our average global soy crush margin to be towards the lower end of the guided range during the second quarter as the market balances strong soybean availability against increased crush capacity. We still remain confident in our full year planning assumptions as we move through the seasonally lower middle of the year as the world pivots to South American production. In carbohydrate solutions, we anticipate the second quarter to be higher versus the prior year, driven by solid demand and margins in North American starches and sweeteners, partially offset by moderating margins in wheat milling and international corn milling after elevated results in the prior year period. We anticipate solid demand for ethanol, both domestically and in the export markets, similar to the prior year. For nutrition, the second quarter is expected to be lower versus the prior year as we face headwinds in specialty ingredients. We anticipate to see another quarter of sequential improvement as we continue to make progress in demand fulfillment. Back to you, Juan. Can I offer a complementary view? I just wanted to offer you a complementary view on Juan's comments with regard to Animal Nutrition, but I think it also applies to the broader portfolio, which is I fully agree with Juan in the sense that the base business in Animal Nutrition is now experiencing the benefits of the cost improvement programs that we put in place, and we've seen that evolution quarter-on-quarter. But to Juan's observations on a going-forward basis, you will see a business that is looking to become more focused on the specialty side of its portfolio. As Juan alluded to at the beginning, part of the revenue calculation for the platform is partly impacted by the fact that there is a soy mill commodity component to some of the products that are produced. Over time, it's a business that will evolve to become more specialty focused, more higher margin focused. I think it bodes well for the growth and margin structure of that business as we look forward into 2025. Yes. So in terms of overall volume, volume was a complementary question. Overall, we've seen volume hold up well. The exception to that would be, obviously, the Specialty Ingredients business and specifically, the impacts of the Decatur East plant. But all of the other elements of our business have generally performed well volume-wise. So you've seen a bit of a deterioration of the volume on a revenue basis, but you have seen a general improvement except for the SI business when it came to volume. Yes. Adam, on the drive for excellence, we're actually quite encouraged by the progress. As Juan mentioned during the remarks, we have more than 1,200 initiatives, but they can be grouped into substantial areas or themes of effort and focus, working on plant process optimization, working on business process optimization, also very important on supply chain and demand fulfillment , which is part of the challenges that we've had in Nutrition. So these would be the large buckets that we're working on. And we've seen the platform progress very well. And we have at least about 1/3rd line of sight of the $500 million already for 2024. So we're very encouraged about the ability of this drive for excellence impacting 2024 already in the measures that I've just outlined. Thank you."
