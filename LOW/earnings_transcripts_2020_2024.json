        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Lowe's Companies' Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Dave Denton, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  \n I would like to remind you that a notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2021. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.  \n Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in this morning's press release and on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their efforts to serve our customers and communities during the ongoing pandemic. In recognition of the efforts and the unique challenges posed by the pandemic, we invested over $100 million in incremental financial assistance for our frontline hourly associates in the quarter, which brought our total COVID-related support for hourly associates to over $900 million for the year.  \n We remain laser-focused on our highest priority, which has always been protecting the health and safety of our associates and communities. And in the quarter, we invested $65 million in support of store safety protocols and our communities. For the year, we invested nearly $1.3 billion in COVID-related support for our associates, store safety and our communities.  \n Now turning to our results. For the quarter, we delivered total company comparable sales growth of 28% over the prior year and 41% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.33. Those results cap off a fiscal 2020 where comp sales increased 26% and adjusted earnings per share grew 54% to $8.86. Looking at the fourth quarter results from a geographic perspective in the U.S., growth was broad-based, with comparable sales growth exceeding 19% across all 15 geographic regions and exceeding 25% for all U.S. divisions.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 121% as customers shifted more of their shopping online, especially over the holiday season. We continue to enhance our omnichannel retailing capabilities in store operations, on Lowes.com and across our supply chain, with our goal to meet customer demand to shop however, whenever and wherever they choose.  \n Once again, DIY comps outpaced Pro comps in the quarter, driven by consumer mindset that remains focused on the home. During the pandemic, the home has come to serve 4 primary purposes: a residence, a home school, a home office and the primary location for recreation and entertainment.\n In addition to the strength in the DIY customer, our continued focus on the Pro is a very important component of our total home market share acceleration strategy. And Pro continues to show strong momentum, evidenced by the mid-20s comp in the quarter and nearly a 20% comp for the year. \n Part of our Q4 success in Pro was driven by our steps to tailor our service offering for these busy customers, even redesigning the footprint of our stores to facilitate a fast, intuitive shopping experience for our small and medium-sized Pro. Pros are rewarding our efforts with their repeat business, returning to shop our stores over and over again. \n Looking forward, we're focused on further enhancing our service levels, both in-store and online, to meet the needs of our new and existing Pro customers. Joe will discuss our efforts to grow market share in Pro later on the call.  \n Now turning to Canada. We delivered comp growth in the mid-teens despite several COVID-related operating restrictions that went into effect during the quarter. The new Canadian leadership team made tremendous progress in 2020 and remains focused on improving operational efficiency by executing a retail fundamentals playbook to drive greater labor productivity and improve gross margins.  \n And as I mentioned earlier, we're gaining traction with our new Total Home strategy, which is our commitment at Lowe's to provide everything a customer needs for their home. As an example, during the quarter, we quickly pivoted from a successful holiday Season of Savings event to launch 2 events to support our Total Home strategy in January, a home organization event and a bath event.  \n During the home organization event, we provided our customers with storage solutions for their home and garages, freeing up valuable space for other activities. The bath event helped our customers find everything they need from paint to fixtures to toilets and tubs and even towels to upgrade their bathrooms. And for the customers who didn't want to do-it-yourself, we provided installation services. Truly a total home solution for a dream bathroom. Both events helped us to close out the fourth quarter with very strong sales in January. \n Looking forward, I am confident we're making the right investments to leverage our Total Home strategy, while we shift our focus from retail fundamentals to accelerating our efforts to gain market share. \n As a reminder, our Total Home strategy will drive market share acceleration by enhancing our investments in Pro, online, installation services, localization and elevating our product assortment. We are confident that these initiatives will allow us to drive sustainable market share growth as we deliver a total home solution for our Pro and DIY customers.  \n Before I close, I'd like to once again extend my heartfelt appreciation to our associates for their dedication to serving our communities in this time of need. Doing the most challenging personal and professional year in many of our lives, our associates made enormous sacrifices for our customers and communities. \n And I'm very pleased that the marketplace is taking notice as reflected by Fortune magazine recently recognizing Lowe's as the #1 Most Admired Specialty Retailer, bestowing that honor on Lowe's for the first time in 17 years. We're humbled by the recognition, but we also know that 2021 will be a very unpredictable year. \n Even with the vaccine rollout underway in the U.S. and Canada, we continue to grapple with numerous challenges presented by COVID-19. And although the business environment remains uncertain, we're confident that we will continue to drive market share gains and operating efficiency. \n Also, our newly developed operational agility allows us to quickly respond to a wide range of potential macro outcomes in 2021. And we will not lose focus on our #1 priority, which is supporting the health and safety of our associates and our customers. \n And with that, I turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. We delivered U.S. home improvement comparable sales growth of 28.6% in the fourth quarter. And consistent with the trends we've seen since the second quarter, growth was broad-based across both DIY and Pro customers, in-store and online and across all merchandising departments. In fact, all 15 merchandising departments generated positive comps of over 16%.  \n Great execution, combined with our compelling product offering of well-known national brands, balanced with high-value private brands, ensured that we were well positioned to meet the continued elevated demand for home-related projects during the quarter. \n Lumber was, once again, the top performer, driven by strong unit demand across Pro and DIY customers, as well as commodity inflation. Our merchants and our supply chain teams did an exceptional job in working with our vendor partners to keep up with demand and to ensure that our stores were stocked with job lot quantities. \n Several other categories posted comps above 30%, including building materials, which was driven by strong demand for roofing and gutters. An improved level of in-stock and an exceptional customer service have allowed us to continue to grow our Pro business in these Pro-focused building product categories. \n Our seasonal and outdoor living, lawn and garden and paint categories also delivered comps above 30% in the quarter, reflecting the consumers' continued focus on the home. Our seasonal and outdoor living team delivered a successful holiday season with a holiday trim a tree program that exceeded the customers' expectations. The team also leveraged our selection in key brands to drive strong sales in grills, patio heaters and fire pits, as these categories were strong throughout the quarter as consumers continue to enjoy their outdoor spaces. \n Outdoor power equipment was driven by sales of chore-related product, such as snowblowers, generators and pressure washers, as customers navigated the weather and worked to maintain their outdoor areas. \n Continuing the theme of enhancing the outdoors, we saw strength in lawn and garden, with notable outperformance in holiday-related live nursery, along with growth in hardscapes, outdoor planters and cleaning products.  \n And finally, our paint category also continued its strong performance with both interior and exterior stains delivering strong comps as the weather early in the quarter remained favorable. \n Now turning to our online results. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered sales growth of 121% on Lowes.com, our third consecutive quarter with over 100% comps online. And during the quarter, we continued to enhance the user experience as we simplified the search and checkout features to speed up the process for customers shopping online. \n And we are also now working on replatforming LowesForPros to the cloud to be completed in the first half of this year, which will significantly enhance the features that we offer to these time-pressed customers and then further build out our loyalty with the Pro.  \n As we discussed last quarter, we have been resetting the layout of our U.S. stores with approximately 95% of our resets now complete. We expect to drive greater sales productivity per square foot by achieving 3 key objectives with this investment. First, driving Pro sales through a more intuitive and faster shopping experience as we've now placed relevant products adjacent to each other and added a Pro flex area for grab-and-go products at the front of the store.  \n Second, increasing our localized product assortment by eliminating unproductive bays without planograms or what we call junk bays, which now opens up space for new products, better tailored to the local market. And then finally, third, driving more transactions by moving the basket-building category of cleaning products to the main power aisle of the store.  \n We're confident that our stores are now easier to shop for both Pro and DIY customers, which positions us well to accelerate our market share gains. I'd like to offer my sincere appreciation to all the teams across the company who work so diligently to execute on this strategic initiative in such a short period of time. \n We also continue to elevate our brand and product offerings. We are continuing to build on our position as the leading appliance retailer in the U.S. with the addition of Midea and Hisense appliances to our stores. \n And Lowe's will soon become the exclusive home improvement provider of Mansfield plumbing products. This addition will make Lowe's the only home improvement retailer to offer customers the top 3 toilet brands in the U.S.: Kohler, American Standard and Mansfield.  \n As we transition to spring, we're in a great position to safely serve customers, and our teams have already been preparing by completing our new spring sets as we anticipate the arrival of the season around the country. \n Leveraging our leading position in outdoor power equipment, we have a wide selection from EGO, the top-selling brand in battery-powered OPE, to John Deere, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Honda and Aaron's. In addition, we will have a terrific selection of patio furniture, including our refreshed allen + roth patio program, complemented by a wide array of grills as we continue to leverage the 2 leading brands in outdoor grilling, Weber and Char-Broil. \n We're confident that our products will inspire customers that are looking to upgrade their outdoor space, which we think will continue to remain a retreat for many this spring season.  \n We're continuing to make changes to improve traffic flow within our outdoor garden centers to ensure social distancing while shopping, as well as showcasing inspirational vignettes and utilizing enhanced vendor support, all of which will drive a great spring season in lawn and garden. \n And finally, we are excited to deliver new innovation in flooring with the launch of Pergo WetProtect technology available in laminate, engineered wood and rigid luxury vinyl, and offering guaranteed protection for both the flooring and subflooring. This new level of total moisture protection is a great Lowe's exclusive product that will provide peace of mind for consumers and further differentiate our flooring offering. \n This spring, we will demonstrate to consumers that we provide everything they need to make their homes and backyards functional and safe, a reflection of our Total Home strategy. I'm looking forward to sharing more with you about our reimagined approach to spring on our next call.  \n And before I close, I'd like to express my thanks for the resilience and dedication showed by our merchants and vendor partners during what was truly an extraordinary year as these teams work tirelessly to meet the high levels of demand for our products and services. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. This past year presented challenges that few of us could have imagined. Lowe's has always been at the forefront in responding to crisis in our communities, and our associates rose to the challenge once again in 2020. \n In recognition of the outstanding efforts of our associates, in January, we announced a bonus of $300 for each full-time associate and $150 for each part-time associate. This $80 million bonus brought the total COVID-related assistance to our associates to over $900 million in 2020. \n And I could not be more pleased to announce today that for the fourth quarter in a row, 100% of our stores are under \"Winning Together\" profit-sharing bonus totaling $90 million. And because of their efforts, once again exceeded expectations, this represents an incremental $30 million over the target payment level. \n And we're supporting our communities again through hiring as we bring on more than 50,000 seasonal and full-time retail associates this spring to ensure that our customers get the exceptional service they expect from Lowe's. This builds on the more than 90,000 associates hired into permanent roles over the past year. \n 2020 changed the way the customers shop with Lowe's. Nowhere is this more evident than the 111% sales growth on Lowes.com for the year. And with roughly 60% of these online orders fulfilled in our stores, we needed to dramatically expand our fulfillment capabilities to support this increased demand. We began by rapidly rolling out curbside pickup in the first quarter, and then we began to launch touchless BOPIS lockers in our stores a few months later.  \n We now have BOPIS lockers in over 1,200 stores with the goal of rolling out lockers to all U.S. stores by April. Providing multiple contactless pickup options for our customers, we are meeting consumer demands to shop Lowe's in whatever way they choose. \n And we've continued to enhance the mobile app to improve the customer pickup experience. This quarter, we began rolling out geofencing technology that alerts our stores when customers are on their way to pick up their orders, enabling quicker fulfillment when they arrive at the store. \n Last quarter, we announced that we were standing up dedicated fulfillment teams to handle all in-store fulfillment orders. All of these enhancements from the easy-to-use BOPIS lockers and the new geofencing technology, to the focus on the fulfillment teams, have already driven improvements in customer satisfaction and speed of service. \n Importantly, the fulfillment teams are also improving productivity as they leverage enhancements that we've made to the picking app. This is evidenced by a dramatic reduction in the number of hours needed to fulfill orders for pickup. In fact, we can now fulfill orders 6x faster on average than 1 year ago. \n Now let's turn to our performance with the Pro. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered mid-20s comps in the fourth quarter. We continue to enhance our Pro loyalty offering by providing Pros with the tools they need to get the job done. This time of the year, our Pros are focused on not only their project pipeline, but they also need to close their books just like any other business.  \n As a true partner to the Pro, we are now providing our Pro loyalty members with a $100 discount on TurboTax. Our Pro loyalty members can also export up to 24 months of transaction history, expediting their year-end close process. It's value-added offers like these that truly differentiate our Pro loyalty offering. \n Throughout 2020, we continue to raise the bar on our offering for the Pro, with better service levels, the right brands and products and the job lot quantities they need. Every day, we are demonstrating that Lowe's is executing our commitment to be the new home for Pros, which is reflected in the strong repeat rates that we're earning from new and existing customers.\n I'd like to offer a special thanks to the entire Pro team for a fantastic year. Job well done. And I'm looking forward to building on this momentum as we continue to grow our Pro penetration. \n And one way that will drive greater Pro penetration is through our newly launched Pro customer relationship management, or CRM tool. Rolled out to all stores in late January, this new technology provides our Pro desk with the tools to manage, grow and retain Pro accounts through consistent and data-driven selling actions. We will also be able to associate any transaction regardless of tender type to a specific Pro account, allowing us for better record-keeping for their business.  \n Store associate training is currently underway, and we expect that the targeted outreach enabled by this tool will facilitate stronger and more personal relationships with our Pro customers. \n Over the past few years, the store operations team has made considerable strides in improving productivity in our stores, with technology enhancements that free up our associates to spend more time in the aisles serving customers. \n As we move into 2021, we are kicking off a new productivity initiative in-store operations that we are calling our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI. This key productivity initiative will play a critical role in our continued multiyear improvement in operating profit. \n Through PPI, we will leverage new processes and technology to deliver continuous productivity enhancements. Some of the most significant technology initiatives under PPI are modernized checkout infrastructure, industry-leading in-store workforce management tools, new touchscreen POS, expanded rollout of digital signs, incremental functionality deployed to the handheld devices and enhanced store inventory management systems, to name a few.  \n These perpetual productivity improvements will help us to move toward our multiyear goal of achieving $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion in store OpEx productivity that we set at the December investor update. I look forward to updating you on the progress we are making towards these important productivity initiatives on future calls. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. \nDavid Denton: Thank you, Joe. I'll begin this morning with a few comments regarding the company's robust capital allocation strategy. In fiscal 2020, we generated $9.3 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating performance, and we returned $6.7 billion to our shareholders through both a combination of share repurchases and dividends.  \n During the fourth quarter alone, we paid $452 million in dividends at $0.60 per share. We also repurchased 21.1 million shares for $3.4 billion at an average price of approximately $160 a share. This brings the total to $5 billion in share repurchases for the year. We have approximately $20 billion remaining on our share repurchases authorization and plan to utilize our strong cash flow to drive significant long-term shareholder value.  \n Capital expenditures totaled $619 million in the quarter and $1.8 billion for the full year as we invest in the business to support our strategic growth initiatives. We ended 2020 with $4.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. And along with $3 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, we have immediate access to $7.7 billion in funds. We remain confident that we have ample liquidity to navigate any unforeseen circumstances. At the end of the fiscal year, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.2x. \n Now I'd like to turn to the income statement. In Q4, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32 compared to $0.66 last year, an increase of 100%. In the quarter, there was a very modest impact on operating income related to the previously announced Canadian restructuring. \n Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. \n In Q4, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.33, an increase of 41% compared to the prior year. These results were driven by higher-than-expected sales volume reflecting a continued consumer focus on the home, a modest benefit from the next round of government stimulus checks as well as strong execution across our operations.  \n Operating margin improved in the quarter as our strong focus on cost control and productivity continued to pay dividends. Q4 sales were $20.3 billion, driven by a comparable sales increase of 28.1%. This was due to comparable store average ticket growth of 14.2% and transaction growth of 13.9%, with strong repeat rates from both new and existing customers.  \n Commodity inflation drove a benefit of approximately 300 basis points to comps in the quarter as lumber continues to experience rising prices. U.S. comp sales were up 28.6% in the quarter. And consistent with our results for the past few quarters, growth was well balanced across both DIY and Pro customers, selling channels, merchandise departments and geographies. Our U.S. monthly comps accelerated through the quarter, were 23.8% in November, 28% in December and 35.7% in January.  \n As Marvin mentioned, the company pivoted quickly from a strong holiday selling season in late December to launch bath and home organization events in early January. January sales also benefited modestly from the second round of government stimulus. \n Adjusted gross margin was 31.8%, down 9 basis points from last year. Despite cycling over significant improvements last year in our process to more effectively manage product margin, product gross margin rate improved 125 basis points driven by continued execution on our pricing, cost management and promotional strategies.  \n We took a less promotional stance across all categories, including our focus on EDLP and appliances, which benefited margin in the quarter. In addition, strong demand from holiday products led to good sell-through and minimal seasonal write-offs in Q4. These benefits to adjusted gross margin were offset by 40 basis points of pressure from inventory shrink, 40 basis points of pressure from supply chain cost, 35 basis points of pressure from lumber installation and 20 basis points of pressure from lower credit revenue.  \n Adjusted SG&A of 22.3% levered 42 basis points to 2019. As we anticipated, we incurred approximately $165 million of COVID-related expenses. These investments included approximately $100 million in financial assistance for our frontline associates and approximately $60 million related to cleaning and other safety-related programs, as well as approximately $5 million in charitable contributions. These $165 million of COVID-related expenses negatively impacted SG&A leverage by approximately 80 basis points.  \n As expected, we incurred approximately $150 million in the U.S. stores reset project, which negatively impacted SG&A leverage by approximately 75 basis points. As Bill mentioned, the resets have been completed in approximately 95% of our stores. These incremental costs were offset by payroll leverage of approximately 105 basis points related to higher sales volume and improved store operating efficiencies, occupancy leverage of approximately 30 basis points and advertising leverage of approximately 25 basis points.  \n Adjusted operating income margin of 7.6% of sales for the quarter was up 41 basis points to the prior year as operational productivity improvements were offset somewhat by significant investments in our stores and supply chain to drive long-term growth. \n In addition, increasing investments in short-lived technology and store fixture assets is resulting in higher levels of depreciation versus our historical run rate. The adjusted effective tax was 25.8%. The tax rate was slightly lower than expected due to better-than-anticipated performance of our Canadian business in Q4. \n We continue to build up our inventory levels throughout the quarter to meet the sustained high levels of customer demand. At year-end, inventory was $16.2 billion, and lumber inflation increased inventory values by approximately $240 million. \n Now before I close, let me talk about our current trends and how we're planning our business in '21. Although February is the easiest comp this year, we are encouraged that the strong broad-based sales trends that we saw in the fourth quarter have continued this month, apart from the impact of the recent winter storms. \n Looking at the balance of the year, our approach to 2021 remains consistent with how we outlined our planning at our December investor update. Like many companies, we have limited visibility into future business trends. It remains unclear when there will be a widespread availability of the COVID vaccine and whether there will be additional COVID-related restrictions like we're experiencing in the Canadian business today. \n Given the near-term uncertainty, at our December investor update, we outlined 3 different market-based scenarios on how the mix-adjusted home improvement market might perform, be it weak, moderate or robust performance levels. Keep in mind that our business is more heavily weighted in DIY and less penetrated in online than the broader market, both of which create modest downward pressure on the Lowe's home improvement market outlook.  \n These 3 market scenarios would result in total sales expectations ranging from $82 billion to $86 billion for the year. While each scenario represents a top line decline from 2020 as we cycle this unprecedented industry growth, we continue to expect that our sales result will outperform the market as our initiatives are focused on delivering market share gains.  \n Additionally, in each scenario, we expect our adjusted operating margin to increase year-over-year, ranging from 11.2% to 12%, depending upon the demand environment. And consistent with my comments at the investor update in December, embedded in each of these scenarios are the incremental investments in frontline associate wages and equity programs that totaled $1.4 billion through 2019 and 2020.  \n At the same time, we have implemented a slate of perpetual productivity initiatives that Joe mentioned earlier. And we are investing to drive operational efficiencies in our business. We will also lap significant nonrecurring spend from 2020. \n While it's still very early in the year, we are seeing market trends essentially in line with the robust market scenario. This scenario assumes the relevant home improvement market will experience a modest contraction this year, and our sales would approach $86 billion. We will remain agile to react rapidly to any changes in the market, and we are able to quickly flex store labor, advertising and incentive comp expenses. \n And consistent with what we outlined at Investor Day, we are expecting $9 billion in share repurchases this year. Our repurchases activity should be roughly ratable by quarter but a little more concentrated in the first half of the year, given the robust cash flow generation driven by our spring selling season. And we are planning for approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures in '21. \n So in closing, we remain extremely excited about the future of our business and its ability to continue to deliver sustainable shareholder value. \n With that, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nSeth Sigman: Congrats on all the progress. Dave, I wanted to follow-up on the guidance point here. Obviously, not full guidance, but the scenarios you discussed in December. If I recall, it included gross margin relatively flat. Given the pressure as you saw in the fourth quarter, I'm just curious, should we be thinking about gross margin in '21 down slightly, but maybe more benefits from SG&A to still get to the same EBIT margin outlook? How should we be thinking about that? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Seth, Happy New Year. Good question. Just I think, most importantly, is we're really focused on operating income and margin expansion as we cycle into this year. Clearly, we're focused on improving our gross margin performance, as you've seen us do that consistently through 2020. We continue to make really nice progress from a product cost perspective. \n I think what you're also seeing us do is we're investing from a supply chain perspective to make sure that we're building out in the future to meet the needs and demands of consumers in the future. So I think we're excited about that. I do expect that gross margin over the longer term, think about it flattish. We are experiencing some headwinds as we think about inflation from lumber, but nothing has materially changed from what we discussed in December, Seth. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question about demand. Obviously, the strength you've seen has been pretty broad-based. Beyond some of the seasonal variations that you've been seeing, I'm just curious how you see the consumer or the customer evolving their focus in the category? How are the types of projects changing? And part of the question is whether you're seeing an acceleration in some of the bigger projects that may have been constrained during parts of this year. Because it does feel like the mid-20s Pro comp that you pointed to, does seem like that's an acceleration. So I just wanted to get a little bit more context on that. \nMarvin Ellison: So Seth, this is Marvin. I'll take part of that, and I'll let Joe comment a bit on Pro. As we've said, 2021, to state the obvious, is a very difficult environment to forecast. And I think all your questions are relevant. And what we can say is when you look at the comp cadence for the month during the quarter, you saw us accelerate throughout. You look at the month of January, which is a significant sales performer, and both Dave and I discussed the importance of our Total Home strategy leaning into those 2 events, the bath event and the home organization event, that gives you an indication that the customer is still in the project mindset as they continue to find ways to make their home more livable and more comfortable for all the various activities that COVID has forced upon us. \n So the short answer to your question is we feel great about the mood of the customer. We feel great about the trends relative to big ticket, small ticket, Pro and installations. And all the work that we put in place the last 2 years in our retail fundamental strategy just gave us a good position and platform to service the customer effectively across all those different categories. \n I'm going to let Joe talk a little bit about Pro because, again, we're very proud of the performance. As we mentioned in the prepared comments, we delivered mid-20% comps in the quarter for the year. We're hovering around 20% comps. And this was in an environment early in the year where the Pro business became very soft just because of the normal occurrences of customers not being comfortable allowing strangers in their homes. \n I'll let Joe discuss a little bit more on our excitement around Pro. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Marvin. And Seth, thank you for the question. You're correct, from Q3 to Q4, we did see a nice comp acceleration. We're excited about the underlying demand in the Pro space. As we look at the kind of robust pipeline that's out there in the Pro space, thinking about the expanded product offerings that we've had throughout the year. In addition, I mentioned in my prepared comments, the benefit from TurboTax and the progress that we're making to help these Pros expedite their year-end close. \n And then in addition, we've been focused on all the fundamentals. And as we continue to move forward, confident that things like our U.S. stores reset and the area that we created for Pros and the ease of Pros to shop. In addition, very excited about the growth of our new Pro loyalty platform, along with the integrated CRM that rolls out. And very excited about what's happening inside the Pro business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on the outlook or the perspective, if you will. Dave, you mentioned that the business is tracking towards a robust case. And I know robust, I don't know if it was couched as a base case for you or not, but I think we're interpreting it as one. Do you have any more confidence in that? Or are you expecting some twist and turns as the year goes? Or the fact that we're tracking there gives you confidence that -- more confidence in that scenario? \nDavid Denton: Listen, I think we're only a few weeks into the year, but I think we feel encouraged by the trends that we're seeing at the moment. So I think we -- as Joe and Marvin just articulated, I think the health of the Pro business is sustainable and it's actually accelerating a bit. So I think we feel really good about that. At the same time, the consumer remains healthy and continues to invest in the home to support both their living needs but also their educational needs for the kids, in many cases, and continue to invest to make sure that, that is an asset that is sustainable for them going forward. So we're encouraged at this point, but pretty early still. \nMarvin Ellison: Simeon, this is Marvin. And what I'll add to that is, we'll go back to the same theme that you'll probably hear us say all morning. Obviously, we can't predict with any high degree of precision what 2021 macro will look like. But we're confident in 2 things: number one, that we're going to take market share; and number two, we're going to improve operating income. And I think for us, we're just planting our flag on those 2 things. \n We believe that 2020 was not an anomaly. We believe it's a reflection of a lot of hard work and retail fundamental implementations we put in place across Lowes.com, Pro, merchandising, store operations, IT infrastructure. And we believe that those initiatives and our Total Home market acceleration strategy is going to allow us to continue to take market share and, at the same time, improving operating income. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And my follow-up is in the robust case of 120 basis points, I think, for margin expansion. I don't know if we said, but how much can you look at that amount and divide it among top line dependent versus internal execution or transformation dependent. I don't know if we looked at it that way or if we could bridge it versus the other scenarios. \nDavid Denton: Yes. I would just encourage you maybe to go back and look at our Analyst Day presentation. I had a building block slide in that presentation that walked us from kind of where we -- where our guidance was for the end of 2020 to a 12% margin rate perspective. And I think it does show a little bit of -- kind of how gross margin might perform as well as how SG&A is going to perform. And again, this is largely about, in aggregate, gross margin rates being relatively flat and us improving our SG&A performance across the business. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if there was any way you could update us on what Pro is as a percentage of your sales today? I feel like there is some ceiling with your stock price or valuation because the thinking is, is you just don't have as big of exposure to the Pro as your main competitor. But with the comps that you've put up in 2020 and all the initiatives, I wondered if there was any further insight into what that percentage of sales is today. \nMarvin Ellison: Kate, this is Marvin. The best way that I'll answer that is we're going to pretty much stick to our 20% to 25% penetration. We're going to reevaluate that, obviously, coming out of 2020. The key is that, as you know, DIY significantly outpenetrated the Pro during the year. So we know that the 2020 data may not be a good, consistent data set to look at relative to Pro and DIY penetration. So we probably need to cycle through the first half of 2021 to get that data really balanced out. What I can say is, in Joe's prepared comments and also in mine, we laid out some of the specific initiatives related to the Pro. \n One of the key things that we focused on arriving at Lowe's a little over 2 years ago, is one of the main reasons why we had a gap relative to sales per square foot productivity and operating income by store was because the Pro penetration was significantly less than what it should have been. Pros drive productivity in multiple product categories throughout the entire store. And so part of our focus on the Pro is because we know it's going to be critical for us to improve overall productivity from a space perspective as well as driving operating income throughout the store. So we'll get back to you later in the year on an answer. But the key is we're going to be focused on it, and we think we're making great improvements. \nDavid Denton: And Kate, I'll just add that we look at it a little bit the opposite. We are underpenetrated, but that is the big opportunity we have. And all the investments we're making is going to allow us to really accelerate in that business segment pretty significantly over the next several years. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And then my follow-up question is just on wages and how we should think about that in 2021 relative to what was paid in 2020, especially considering the number of bonuses that were given to associates during that time. \nMarvin Ellison: So Kate, this is Marvin. I'll take it. And if Dave wants to provide any additional financial analysis, he can. But I think at the highest level, what we've laid out for operating income targets for 2021, what we laid out at the investor update in December and what Dave mentioned in his prepared comments, reflect any investments we intend to make in our associates. The good news for us, and Dave mentioned this earlier in the morning, that from the year 2019 and 2020 made a $1.4 billion investment in incremental wages, equity programs and other associate-related benefits, and that was pre-COVID. \n So other retailers candidly are catching up to the work investment that we already made going into COVID, so we don't have an enormous bogey, so to speak, that we need to make from an investment standpoint to catch up. We've been on a pathway to get our wages up. That's why we're very proud to say that we are one of the highest wage retailers from an hourly associate perspective in the U.S. \n So we don't see 2021 as anything that will be materially different than that. Obviously, we'll look at how the business is tracking, we'll look at the needs of our associates. But any investments we plan to make has already been factored into any financial guidance or at least the range of guidance that Dave has discussed in December and this morning. \nJoseph McFarland: So Kate, it's Joe, and thanks for the question. I'll just add a few things to what Marvin said. And over the last 2 years, we've been taking steps from a store operation standpoint to simplify the store structure, if you think about some of the updates we've given, our 4 levels of sales associate on the sales floor and all the work we've done. And so in addition, the labor management tools and the workforce management initiatives the team has laid out, I feel very good about the balance of ticket and transactions in our transaction-based labor model, and that will continue, to be able to deliver on the operational efficiency we need to. \n And then finally, for the spring hiring season, we feel that we've done a nice job addressing any difficult-to-hire markets. We measure the pipeline of sales associates coming in by position by market, so we've made adjustments where we need to and feel confident going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Given the introduction of the PPI initiative, is it likely that you'll come in at the high end of the profitability scenario, even if you don't come in -- even if you come in at the middle end or low end of your sales scenario for 2021? \nDavid Denton: Michael, it's Dave here. Clearly, what we're doing is we're working really diligently to improve the productivity across our business. And Joe has kicked off a pretty major effort to do that. But we're doing it really across all segments of our operation. \n That's probably a little bit more specific guidance, if you will, so we're probably not going to go there. But I'll just say that as a management team and as a business, we're controlling what we can control. We're making sure that as we look at these sales scenarios over time is that we're improving our operating income performance. And we're dead set on improving that. We're very focused and adamant about going after that. And I think we have a very good line of sight to that. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. And it seems like you're going to have more takes than puts on your gross margin this year with supply chain pressures, probably inflation drag for at least the near term, and what's likely to be at least some return to a more promotional environment. So in that scenario, with your gross margin already declining in the fourth quarter, how do you keep it flat in 2021? What are the offsets? \nDavid Denton: Well, listen, we're focused in a few different areas. We've just enhanced our pricing and promotional tools, from a merchandising perspective. I think the merchants have just kind of taken a step back and looked at, from a promotional cadence perspective, how to think of more of an EDLP type environment, at the same time going out and negotiating special buys in certain areas to drive real value from a consumer perspective. I think we're getting a lot more efficient on how we layer in and out of our online business to drive both top line and improve profitability. At the same time, we do need to manage our supply chain to be more efficient as we think about same day, next day deliveries to the home and to the job site. \n So all those levers are things that we're working on that we're actively using to manage our gross margin performance. And yes, we do have some headwinds, but we're also -- that's part of our job is to manage those headwinds to improve performance over time. And again, with a real focus, once again, Michael, on improving our operating income flow through, that's the opportunity we have. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. And then... \nWilliam Boltz: Michael, this is Bill. I'll just add a couple of comments to that. As we've said over the last couple of years, we've been on a journey to get to more of an everyday competitive price. And so getting credit for what we're doing and less of this high-low approach that we had been typically on prior to this leadership team coming in. And then we have done a lot of work in the last 18 months around our localization initiative, and it's one of our key unlocks and part of our Total Home strategy as we go forward that gives us the opportunity from a margin perspective as well. So we're confident that we can deliver on what we said back in December. \nMichael Lasser: If you could just clarify that, though. Where do you stand today in terms of your pricing position versus where you might have been a year ago? If you can use that as a lever to offset some of the gross margin headwinds that you might experience in next couple of quarters. \nMarvin Ellison: Well, look, this is Marvin. What I'll say, Michael, is it's a work in progress. What I can tell you is the set of tools that Bill and the merchants currently have today versus what we had 2 years ago is truly a night and day difference. So it gives us the ability to have localized pricing and we can price now in more smaller clusters. I mean 2 years ago, we were using blunt instruments to price in broad markets. Now we can get down to individual locations. \n In addition to that, Joe talked about the expansion of things like digital signs. It may not sound like a big deal, but there are parts of the store where you have frequent, rather volatile price-changing activities, a lot of labor goes into that. And if you can put a digital process in place, it allows you to capture the different costs and retail changes in a way that actually can benefit gross margin. \n And localization, to Bill's point, solves a couple of major significant issues. But one is you have the right product in the right market. So your exit strategy doesn't just destroy your gross margin because you're clearancing everything just to get it out. I'd use the example at the December update when Bill, Joe and I walked in the store in West Philadelphia and saw riding lawn mowers and big, deep seating patio sets, and sheds and other products that was just waiting for markdown to happen because it was simply in the wrong location from a geographic perspective. \n So Bill's team is working to solve all of that, so we can have the right product in the right location so we don't take deep markdowns to exit. So all of those things will play a role in giving us -- to create our own internal headwind to go up against some of the investments we're making, like in supply chain. So we'll keep you updated on the activities. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I know, as you said, you're kind of trending or contemplating you'll probably be at the robust end of your guidance range. But I guess if you end up actually even slightly better than that, how should we think about operating margin opportunity? Would there be upside to that? Or would you reinvest and kind of maintain the cadence that you'd indicated previously? And then I had one follow-up. \nMarvin Ellison: Sure. Yes, ma'am. So Karen, this is Marvin. The best way to answer that question is the simple statement is that we expect to outperform the market and gain share in 2021. So if the market performs better than our robust scenario, that would be music to our ears, because we would believe that it would only provide us with upside opportunity on the top line and on the bottom line. So again, we're going to just have a very, very singular focus on taking market share and improving operating income. And if the macro improves better than our forecast and better than we anticipate, that will be only good news for us. \nKaren Short: Great. And then I just wanted to see, I don't know if you'd be willing to provide this, but would you be willing to give us some color on the number of Pro loyalty members and then just a quick update on timing of combining the Lowe's credit card with the low -- with the Pro loyalty program? Or does all of that happen at the same time as you migrate to the cloud? \nMarvin Ellison: So I'll take the easiest part of the question, and that is, no, we're not going to provide you with the number of loyalty members from a competitive perspective. What we can tell you is that we're very pleased with the adoption rate and we're very pleased with the returned visit as a result of that. I'll let Joe talk about the merging of credit and the platform. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes, Karen, this is Joe. And thank you for the question. We will be migrating our credit platforms and our Pro loyalty platforms together. We have every intention. That is a part of -- it's a huge part of the benefit. Again, we've been very encouraged by the new sign-ups in Pro loyalty, how the Pro customers are responding. We've been very pleased also with our new credit acquisition from a Pro standpoint. And so with those underlying themes, although we won't release the number of Pros, we're excited about what the platform is delivering and all the work that the Pro team has done. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Can you talk about how you think stimulus helped the business there in January? A very strong comp, obviously at 35%. What do you think the lift was? And how would you compare that lift to what you saw last Spring when stimulus hit? \nDavid Denton: Chris, Dave here. Yes, I do think stimulus, as we cycled into the new year, did help our comps. We estimate somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points from that perspective. I think as stimulus has gone on for a while now, I think the performance and the impact of it has been -- has moderated a little bit. So I think we do see it -- when those trap checks do hit, we do see an inflection kind of up a little bit, but it has not been nearly as dramatic as it was when it first hit basically a year or so ago. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then as you think about -- just to square the T on the gross margin. So in the slides, you have flat gross margin to 12% in the robust scenario. Is there any potential cadence around that? You do have the freight pressures probably earlier, maybe shrink in supply chain investments. So a flat relative to 2020, do you expect it to be maybe down a bit in the first half and then up in the back half and net flat that way? \nDavid Denton: I think that's a little bit more specific than probably what we could give you some color on at this point in time. I'd just say that at the end of the day, back to Marvin's point, is our focus this year taking market share, improving operating income. That's just are 2 things that we're focused on just consistently, and you'll continue to hear us talk about that, demonstrate our performance in those 2 metrics. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. \nEric Bosshard: Curious in regards to the supply chain investments, Pro and online obviously areas of growth and accelerating growth. But what I'm curious to understand is the incremental investments you're making in both of those areas, some of them you've made already, some that are in process. How will the customer experience be different in those areas in '21? And where I'm really trying to end up is in terms of the share gains that you're making in both of those areas, what do you think about the future of that, especially in terms of payback from where you're investing incrementally? \nMarvin Ellison: So Eric, this is Marvin. And early on, we committed to a $1.7 billion supply chain infrastructure investment between the years of 2019 and 2023, and we're well on the pathway to achieve that. Specific to your question, we're trying to create a market-based delivery model, which will transition the pressure of delivery from our individual stores to a market-based model. In addition to that, we're trying to develop a fulfillment model that will serve a customer any way they choose to shop in this omni-channel ecosystem that we're creating. \n So relative to a customer, how will it be different? It would be different that you will have a more seamless delivery with better visibility to appointment, scheduling and arrival, specific to any big and bulky items starting with appliances. So for the DIY or the Pro, if you're in the appliance space, you're going to have a more seamless opportunity to purchase a product. \n Just to take you back to how this has been done historically, when a customer purchases an appliance, the scheduling process is done by an associate calling the customer at home and going through a manual process to try to find a date that best fits the availability of the product and the customers' schedule. To say it's clucky and inconvenient will be an understatement. Now we've transitioned to a digital scheduling model where a customer can choose their own date based on prepublished openness in our system. And our associates have total visibility to inventory, whether it's in their store or in a market-based distribution center. \n What we're doing on the Pro side is also trying to create more of an omni experience. You're going to see us launching Pro lockers later this year. And you're going to see us improve our job site delivery with Pro and have a lot more flexibility around that. So those are 2 ways that those customers will see a difference. And there are a lot of other activities underway that Joe in operations partnering with the supply chain, but we'll wait till a later day to get into those. \nEric Bosshard: Okay. That's helpful. And then one question for Dave. The incremental margin of the business in '21, in an upside sales scenario, does the incremental margin change? And I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is, obviously, in '20, there were incremental investments made through the year as sales came to the upside and were necessary, but diluted the incremental margin of the business. Does that same story play in '21 in a better sales scenario? Or can the incremental margin either be sustained or expand in an upside sales scenario? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Eric, I would say that it should expand a little bit in upside scenario, just given what we've done in 2020, to your point. \n So great. So Rob, with that, we're going to take one more question, please. \nOperator: That question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. \nGregory Melich: Great. I'd love to follow-up on inflation. So I think you called out 300 bps in the fourth quarter. What percentage of your sales, is that really looking at the commodities? And any number you have for the full year? And if you could even talk about the ability to pass through some rise in input costs outside of those commodities, that would be great. \nDavid Denton: So yes, largely, the inflation has been centered primarily in the lumber category. If you think about it from that perspective, and again, about 300 basis points. This is -- from a commodity standpoint, this is something that we're very used to managing. And largely, those are passed on ultimately to the consumer at the store. \nGregory Melich: And for the full year, would that number have been 150 basis points as we're thinking about what it -- how it impacts '21? \nDavid Denton: Yes. I don't know that off the top of my head. But obviously, inflation in the back half of the year was higher than the first half of the year, so it's certainly less than 300 basis points. And we'll keep -- obviously, we'll keep -- we watch it daily. \nGregory Melich: Got it. And then my follow-up question sort of goes back to really supply chain. I know you have the plan, and it's coming along. Just given the investments ramps we've seen on -- particularly in supply chain, not just from your number 1 competitor, Home Depot, but from Amazon, from Walmart, where CapEx is sort of up significantly from where it was a year ago. Is there anything you're seeing that you're planning on leaning more into as you get through the first year or 2 of that $1.7 billion plan, whether it's more market delivery operations, more centralized fulfillment? Anything on that as to what you're seeing them do and how you want to respond. \nMarvin Ellison: No, Greg, I think COVID and the pandemic really taught us all about responding to the needs of the customer in a more dramatic way. And also, it taught us how quickly consumer preferences will shift, specifically when it comes to how customers desire to receive products that they purchase. We feel like our strategy is sound. We're the #1 appliance retailer in the U.S. and we do it the hard way. We deliver it from every store, and that is not an optimal way to manage such a large amount of inventory and such a large expense from a transportation perspective. \n So going to a market-based model is going to unlock an enormous amount of productivity, not only from a store labor perspective but on how we manage billions of dollars in inventory around the company. So market-based delivery is absolutely the way to go. In the moment, we bill the process for appliances, it opens up other product categories like riding lawn mowers and sheds and patio furniture and grills. So this market-based model is going to be incredibly important for us. \n We opened up a dot-com fulfillment DC in Southern California this past year. It gives us the ability to have 2-day delivery from an e-comm perspective to every U.S. location. We're also opening up 3 additional e-commerce fulfillment centers. That's relatively new to our strategy, to answer your question, and that's going to give us the ability to create more same-day next-day delivery opportunities. And we're aggressively building out our bulk distribution centers and our cross docks to help with the market delivery. In addition to that, we're going to be leaning into Pro job site delivery, and we have a couple of initiatives underway that we're working on to make that a reality. \n So the short answer to your question is we benchmark a lot. We look at what's working in the marketplace, but we feel really good about the strategy we've laid out. And there's a reason why most retailers delay supply chain transformations because they're very hard to do. And we're committed to it and we understand the benefit of it. And we're going to make the right investments, and we believe is going to allow us to be competitive in out-years. But as an investment, we know we're going to have to lean into for the next couple of years. But again, it's something we're very committed to. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their efforts to serve our customers and communities during the ongoing pandemic. In recognition of the efforts and the unique challenges posed by the pandemic, we invested over $100 million in incremental financial assistance for our frontline hourly associates in the quarter, which brought our total COVID-related support for hourly associates to over $900 million for the year.  \n We remain laser-focused on our highest priority, which has always been protecting the health and safety of our associates and communities. And in the quarter, we invested $65 million in support of store safety protocols and our communities. For the year, we invested nearly $1.3 billion in COVID-related support for our associates, store safety and our communities.  \n Now turning to our results. For the quarter, we delivered total company comparable sales growth of 28% over the prior year and 41% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.33. Those results cap off a fiscal 2020 where comp sales increased 26% and adjusted earnings per share grew 54% to $8.86. Looking at the fourth quarter results from a geographic perspective in the U.S., growth was broad-based, with comparable sales growth exceeding 19% across all 15 geographic regions and exceeding 25% for all U.S. divisions.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 121% as customers shifted more of their shopping online, especially over the holiday season. We continue to enhance our omnichannel retailing capabilities in store operations, on Lowes.com and across our supply chain, with our goal to meet customer demand to shop however, whenever and wherever they choose.  \n Once again, DIY comps outpaced Pro comps in the quarter, driven by consumer mindset that remains focused on the home. During the pandemic, the home has come to serve 4 primary purposes: a residence, a home school, a home office and the primary location for recreation and entertainment.\n In addition to the strength in the DIY customer, our continued focus on the Pro is a very important component of our total home market share acceleration strategy. And Pro continues to show strong momentum, evidenced by the mid-20s comp in the quarter and nearly a 20% comp for the year. \n Part of our Q4 success in Pro was driven by our steps to tailor our service offering for these busy customers, even redesigning the footprint of our stores to facilitate a fast, intuitive shopping experience for our small and medium-sized Pro. Pros are rewarding our efforts with their repeat business, returning to shop our stores over and over again. \n Looking forward, we're focused on further enhancing our service levels, both in-store and online, to meet the needs of our new and existing Pro customers. Joe will discuss our efforts to grow market share in Pro later on the call.  \n Now turning to Canada. We delivered comp growth in the mid-teens despite several COVID-related operating restrictions that went into effect during the quarter. The new Canadian leadership team made tremendous progress in 2020 and remains focused on improving operational efficiency by executing a retail fundamentals playbook to drive greater labor productivity and improve gross margins.  \n And as I mentioned earlier, we're gaining traction with our new Total Home strategy, which is our commitment at Lowe's to provide everything a customer needs for their home. As an example, during the quarter, we quickly pivoted from a successful holiday Season of Savings event to launch 2 events to support our Total Home strategy in January, a home organization event and a bath event.  \n During the home organization event, we provided our customers with storage solutions for their home and garages, freeing up valuable space for other activities. The bath event helped our customers find everything they need from paint to fixtures to toilets and tubs and even towels to upgrade their bathrooms. And for the customers who didn't want to do-it-yourself, we provided installation services. Truly a total home solution for a dream bathroom. Both events helped us to close out the fourth quarter with very strong sales in January. \n Looking forward, I am confident we're making the right investments to leverage our Total Home strategy, while we shift our focus from retail fundamentals to accelerating our efforts to gain market share. \n As a reminder, our Total Home strategy will drive market share acceleration by enhancing our investments in Pro, online, installation services, localization and elevating our product assortment. We are confident that these initiatives will allow us to drive sustainable market share growth as we deliver a total home solution for our Pro and DIY customers.  \n Before I close, I'd like to once again extend my heartfelt appreciation to our associates for their dedication to serving our communities in this time of need. Doing the most challenging personal and professional year in many of our lives, our associates made enormous sacrifices for our customers and communities. \n And I'm very pleased that the marketplace is taking notice as reflected by Fortune magazine recently recognizing Lowe's as the #1 Most Admired Specialty Retailer, bestowing that honor on Lowe's for the first time in 17 years. We're humbled by the recognition, but we also know that 2021 will be a very unpredictable year. \n Even with the vaccine rollout underway in the U.S. and Canada, we continue to grapple with numerous challenges presented by COVID-19. And although the business environment remains uncertain, we're confident that we will continue to drive market share gains and operating efficiency. \n Also, our newly developed operational agility allows us to quickly respond to a wide range of potential macro outcomes in 2021. And we will not lose focus on our #1 priority, which is supporting the health and safety of our associates and our customers. \n And with that, I turn the call over to Bill. So Seth, this is Marvin. I'll take part of that, and I'll let Joe comment a bit on Pro. As we've said, 2021, to state the obvious, is a very difficult environment to forecast. And I think all your questions are relevant. And what we can say is when you look at the comp cadence for the month during the quarter, you saw us accelerate throughout. You look at the month of January, which is a significant sales performer, and both Dave and I discussed the importance of our Total Home strategy leaning into those 2 events, the bath event and the home organization event, that gives you an indication that the customer is still in the project mindset as they continue to find ways to make their home more livable and more comfortable for all the various activities that COVID has forced upon us. \n So the short answer to your question is we feel great about the mood of the customer. We feel great about the trends relative to big ticket, small ticket, Pro and installations. And all the work that we put in place the last 2 years in our retail fundamental strategy just gave us a good position and platform to service the customer effectively across all those different categories. \n I'm going to let Joe talk a little bit about Pro because, again, we're very proud of the performance. As we mentioned in the prepared comments, we delivered mid-20% comps in the quarter for the year. We're hovering around 20% comps. And this was in an environment early in the year where the Pro business became very soft just because of the normal occurrences of customers not being comfortable allowing strangers in their homes. \n I'll let Joe discuss a little bit more on our excitement around Pro. Simeon, this is Marvin. And what I'll add to that is, we'll go back to the same theme that you'll probably hear us say all morning. Obviously, we can't predict with any high degree of precision what 2021 macro will look like. But we're confident in 2 things: number one, that we're going to take market share; and number two, we're going to improve operating income. And I think for us, we're just planting our flag on those 2 things. \n We believe that 2020 was not an anomaly. We believe it's a reflection of a lot of hard work and retail fundamental implementations we put in place across Lowes.com, Pro, merchandising, store operations, IT infrastructure. And we believe that those initiatives and our Total Home market acceleration strategy is going to allow us to continue to take market share and, at the same time, improving operating income. Kate, this is Marvin. The best way that I'll answer that is we're going to pretty much stick to our 20% to 25% penetration. We're going to reevaluate that, obviously, coming out of 2020. The key is that, as you know, DIY significantly outpenetrated the Pro during the year. So we know that the 2020 data may not be a good, consistent data set to look at relative to Pro and DIY penetration. So we probably need to cycle through the first half of 2021 to get that data really balanced out. What I can say is, in Joe's prepared comments and also in mine, we laid out some of the specific initiatives related to the Pro. \n One of the key things that we focused on arriving at Lowe's a little over 2 years ago, is one of the main reasons why we had a gap relative to sales per square foot productivity and operating income by store was because the Pro penetration was significantly less than what it should have been. Pros drive productivity in multiple product categories throughout the entire store. And so part of our focus on the Pro is because we know it's going to be critical for us to improve overall productivity from a space perspective as well as driving operating income throughout the store. So we'll get back to you later in the year on an answer. But the key is we're going to be focused on it, and we think we're making great improvements. So Kate, this is Marvin. I'll take it. And if Dave wants to provide any additional financial analysis, he can. But I think at the highest level, what we've laid out for operating income targets for 2021, what we laid out at the investor update in December and what Dave mentioned in his prepared comments, reflect any investments we intend to make in our associates. The good news for us, and Dave mentioned this earlier in the morning, that from the year 2019 and 2020 made a $1.4 billion investment in incremental wages, equity programs and other associate-related benefits, and that was pre-COVID. \n So other retailers candidly are catching up to the work investment that we already made going into COVID, so we don't have an enormous bogey, so to speak, that we need to make from an investment standpoint to catch up. We've been on a pathway to get our wages up. That's why we're very proud to say that we are one of the highest wage retailers from an hourly associate perspective in the U.S. \n So we don't see 2021 as anything that will be materially different than that. Obviously, we'll look at how the business is tracking, we'll look at the needs of our associates. But any investments we plan to make has already been factored into any financial guidance or at least the range of guidance that Dave has discussed in December and this morning. Well, look, this is Marvin. What I'll say, Michael, is it's a work in progress. What I can tell you is the set of tools that Bill and the merchants currently have today versus what we had 2 years ago is truly a night and day difference. So it gives us the ability to have localized pricing and we can price now in more smaller clusters. I mean 2 years ago, we were using blunt instruments to price in broad markets. Now we can get down to individual locations. \n In addition to that, Joe talked about the expansion of things like digital signs. It may not sound like a big deal, but there are parts of the store where you have frequent, rather volatile price-changing activities, a lot of labor goes into that. And if you can put a digital process in place, it allows you to capture the different costs and retail changes in a way that actually can benefit gross margin. \n And localization, to Bill's point, solves a couple of major significant issues. But one is you have the right product in the right market. So your exit strategy doesn't just destroy your gross margin because you're clearancing everything just to get it out. I'd use the example at the December update when Bill, Joe and I walked in the store in West Philadelphia and saw riding lawn mowers and big, deep seating patio sets, and sheds and other products that was just waiting for markdown to happen because it was simply in the wrong location from a geographic perspective. \n So Bill's team is working to solve all of that, so we can have the right product in the right location so we don't take deep markdowns to exit. So all of those things will play a role in giving us -- to create our own internal headwind to go up against some of the investments we're making, like in supply chain. So we'll keep you updated on the activities. Sure. Yes, ma'am. So Karen, this is Marvin. The best way to answer that question is the simple statement is that we expect to outperform the market and gain share in 2021. So if the market performs better than our robust scenario, that would be music to our ears, because we would believe that it would only provide us with upside opportunity on the top line and on the bottom line. So again, we're going to just have a very, very singular focus on taking market share and improving operating income. And if the macro improves better than our forecast and better than we anticipate, that will be only good news for us. So I'll take the easiest part of the question, and that is, no, we're not going to provide you with the number of loyalty members from a competitive perspective. What we can tell you is that we're very pleased with the adoption rate and we're very pleased with the returned visit as a result of that. I'll let Joe talk about the merging of credit and the platform. So Eric, this is Marvin. And early on, we committed to a $1.7 billion supply chain infrastructure investment between the years of 2019 and 2023, and we're well on the pathway to achieve that. Specific to your question, we're trying to create a market-based delivery model, which will transition the pressure of delivery from our individual stores to a market-based model. In addition to that, we're trying to develop a fulfillment model that will serve a customer any way they choose to shop in this omni-channel ecosystem that we're creating. \n So relative to a customer, how will it be different? It would be different that you will have a more seamless delivery with better visibility to appointment, scheduling and arrival, specific to any big and bulky items starting with appliances. So for the DIY or the Pro, if you're in the appliance space, you're going to have a more seamless opportunity to purchase a product. \n Just to take you back to how this has been done historically, when a customer purchases an appliance, the scheduling process is done by an associate calling the customer at home and going through a manual process to try to find a date that best fits the availability of the product and the customers' schedule. To say it's clucky and inconvenient will be an understatement. Now we've transitioned to a digital scheduling model where a customer can choose their own date based on prepublished openness in our system. And our associates have total visibility to inventory, whether it's in their store or in a market-based distribution center. \n What we're doing on the Pro side is also trying to create more of an omni experience. You're going to see us launching Pro lockers later this year. And you're going to see us improve our job site delivery with Pro and have a lot more flexibility around that. So those are 2 ways that those customers will see a difference. And there are a lot of other activities underway that Joe in operations partnering with the supply chain, but we'll wait till a later day to get into those. No, Greg, I think COVID and the pandemic really taught us all about responding to the needs of the customer in a more dramatic way. And also, it taught us how quickly consumer preferences will shift, specifically when it comes to how customers desire to receive products that they purchase. We feel like our strategy is sound. We're the #1 appliance retailer in the U.S. and we do it the hard way. We deliver it from every store, and that is not an optimal way to manage such a large amount of inventory and such a large expense from a transportation perspective. \n So going to a market-based model is going to unlock an enormous amount of productivity, not only from a store labor perspective but on how we manage billions of dollars in inventory around the company. So market-based delivery is absolutely the way to go. In the moment, we bill the process for appliances, it opens up other product categories like riding lawn mowers and sheds and patio furniture and grills. So this market-based model is going to be incredibly important for us. \n We opened up a dot-com fulfillment DC in Southern California this past year. It gives us the ability to have 2-day delivery from an e-comm perspective to every U.S. location. We're also opening up 3 additional e-commerce fulfillment centers. That's relatively new to our strategy, to answer your question, and that's going to give us the ability to create more same-day next-day delivery opportunities. And we're aggressively building out our bulk distribution centers and our cross docks to help with the market delivery. In addition to that, we're going to be leaning into Pro job site delivery, and we have a couple of initiatives underway that we're working on to make that a reality. \n So the short answer to your question is we benchmark a lot. We look at what's working in the marketplace, but we feel really good about the strategy we've laid out. And there's a reason why most retailers delay supply chain transformations because they're very hard to do. And we're committed to it and we understand the benefit of it. And we're going to make the right investments, and we believe is going to allow us to be competitive in out-years. But as an investment, we know we're going to have to lean into for the next couple of years. But again, it's something we're very committed to."

            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. I'll begin this morning with a few comments regarding the company's robust capital allocation strategy. In fiscal 2020, we generated $9.3 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating performance, and we returned $6.7 billion to our shareholders through both a combination of share repurchases and dividends.  \n During the fourth quarter alone, we paid $452 million in dividends at $0.60 per share. We also repurchased 21.1 million shares for $3.4 billion at an average price of approximately $160 a share. This brings the total to $5 billion in share repurchases for the year. We have approximately $20 billion remaining on our share repurchases authorization and plan to utilize our strong cash flow to drive significant long-term shareholder value.  \n Capital expenditures totaled $619 million in the quarter and $1.8 billion for the full year as we invest in the business to support our strategic growth initiatives. We ended 2020 with $4.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. And along with $3 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, we have immediate access to $7.7 billion in funds. We remain confident that we have ample liquidity to navigate any unforeseen circumstances. At the end of the fiscal year, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.2x. \n Now I'd like to turn to the income statement. In Q4, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32 compared to $0.66 last year, an increase of 100%. In the quarter, there was a very modest impact on operating income related to the previously announced Canadian restructuring. \n Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. \n In Q4, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.33, an increase of 41% compared to the prior year. These results were driven by higher-than-expected sales volume reflecting a continued consumer focus on the home, a modest benefit from the next round of government stimulus checks as well as strong execution across our operations.  \n Operating margin improved in the quarter as our strong focus on cost control and productivity continued to pay dividends. Q4 sales were $20.3 billion, driven by a comparable sales increase of 28.1%. This was due to comparable store average ticket growth of 14.2% and transaction growth of 13.9%, with strong repeat rates from both new and existing customers.  \n Commodity inflation drove a benefit of approximately 300 basis points to comps in the quarter as lumber continues to experience rising prices. U.S. comp sales were up 28.6% in the quarter. And consistent with our results for the past few quarters, growth was well balanced across both DIY and Pro customers, selling channels, merchandise departments and geographies. Our U.S. monthly comps accelerated through the quarter, were 23.8% in November, 28% in December and 35.7% in January.  \n As Marvin mentioned, the company pivoted quickly from a strong holiday selling season in late December to launch bath and home organization events in early January. January sales also benefited modestly from the second round of government stimulus. \n Adjusted gross margin was 31.8%, down 9 basis points from last year. Despite cycling over significant improvements last year in our process to more effectively manage product margin, product gross margin rate improved 125 basis points driven by continued execution on our pricing, cost management and promotional strategies.  \n We took a less promotional stance across all categories, including our focus on EDLP and appliances, which benefited margin in the quarter. In addition, strong demand from holiday products led to good sell-through and minimal seasonal write-offs in Q4. These benefits to adjusted gross margin were offset by 40 basis points of pressure from inventory shrink, 40 basis points of pressure from supply chain cost, 35 basis points of pressure from lumber installation and 20 basis points of pressure from lower credit revenue.  \n Adjusted SG&A of 22.3% levered 42 basis points to 2019. As we anticipated, we incurred approximately $165 million of COVID-related expenses. These investments included approximately $100 million in financial assistance for our frontline associates and approximately $60 million related to cleaning and other safety-related programs, as well as approximately $5 million in charitable contributions. These $165 million of COVID-related expenses negatively impacted SG&A leverage by approximately 80 basis points.  \n As expected, we incurred approximately $150 million in the U.S. stores reset project, which negatively impacted SG&A leverage by approximately 75 basis points. As Bill mentioned, the resets have been completed in approximately 95% of our stores. These incremental costs were offset by payroll leverage of approximately 105 basis points related to higher sales volume and improved store operating efficiencies, occupancy leverage of approximately 30 basis points and advertising leverage of approximately 25 basis points.  \n Adjusted operating income margin of 7.6% of sales for the quarter was up 41 basis points to the prior year as operational productivity improvements were offset somewhat by significant investments in our stores and supply chain to drive long-term growth. \n In addition, increasing investments in short-lived technology and store fixture assets is resulting in higher levels of depreciation versus our historical run rate. The adjusted effective tax was 25.8%. The tax rate was slightly lower than expected due to better-than-anticipated performance of our Canadian business in Q4. \n We continue to build up our inventory levels throughout the quarter to meet the sustained high levels of customer demand. At year-end, inventory was $16.2 billion, and lumber inflation increased inventory values by approximately $240 million. \n Now before I close, let me talk about our current trends and how we're planning our business in '21. Although February is the easiest comp this year, we are encouraged that the strong broad-based sales trends that we saw in the fourth quarter have continued this month, apart from the impact of the recent winter storms. \n Looking at the balance of the year, our approach to 2021 remains consistent with how we outlined our planning at our December investor update. Like many companies, we have limited visibility into future business trends. It remains unclear when there will be a widespread availability of the COVID vaccine and whether there will be additional COVID-related restrictions like we're experiencing in the Canadian business today. \n Given the near-term uncertainty, at our December investor update, we outlined 3 different market-based scenarios on how the mix-adjusted home improvement market might perform, be it weak, moderate or robust performance levels. Keep in mind that our business is more heavily weighted in DIY and less penetrated in online than the broader market, both of which create modest downward pressure on the Lowe's home improvement market outlook.  \n These 3 market scenarios would result in total sales expectations ranging from $82 billion to $86 billion for the year. While each scenario represents a top line decline from 2020 as we cycle this unprecedented industry growth, we continue to expect that our sales result will outperform the market as our initiatives are focused on delivering market share gains.  \n Additionally, in each scenario, we expect our adjusted operating margin to increase year-over-year, ranging from 11.2% to 12%, depending upon the demand environment. And consistent with my comments at the investor update in December, embedded in each of these scenarios are the incremental investments in frontline associate wages and equity programs that totaled $1.4 billion through 2019 and 2020.  \n At the same time, we have implemented a slate of perpetual productivity initiatives that Joe mentioned earlier. And we are investing to drive operational efficiencies in our business. We will also lap significant nonrecurring spend from 2020. \n While it's still very early in the year, we are seeing market trends essentially in line with the robust market scenario. This scenario assumes the relevant home improvement market will experience a modest contraction this year, and our sales would approach $86 billion. We will remain agile to react rapidly to any changes in the market, and we are able to quickly flex store labor, advertising and incentive comp expenses. \n And consistent with what we outlined at Investor Day, we are expecting $9 billion in share repurchases this year. Our repurchases activity should be roughly ratable by quarter but a little more concentrated in the first half of the year, given the robust cash flow generation driven by our spring selling season. And we are planning for approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures in '21. \n So in closing, we remain extremely excited about the future of our business and its ability to continue to deliver sustainable shareholder value. \n With that, we are now ready for questions. Yes. Seth, Happy New Year. Good question. Just I think, most importantly, is we're really focused on operating income and margin expansion as we cycle into this year. Clearly, we're focused on improving our gross margin performance, as you've seen us do that consistently through 2020. We continue to make really nice progress from a product cost perspective. \n I think what you're also seeing us do is we're investing from a supply chain perspective to make sure that we're building out in the future to meet the needs and demands of consumers in the future. So I think we're excited about that. I do expect that gross margin over the longer term, think about it flattish. We are experiencing some headwinds as we think about inflation from lumber, but nothing has materially changed from what we discussed in December, Seth. Listen, I think we're only a few weeks into the year, but I think we feel encouraged by the trends that we're seeing at the moment. So I think we -- as Joe and Marvin just articulated, I think the health of the Pro business is sustainable and it's actually accelerating a bit. So I think we feel really good about that. At the same time, the consumer remains healthy and continues to invest in the home to support both their living needs but also their educational needs for the kids, in many cases, and continue to invest to make sure that, that is an asset that is sustainable for them going forward. So we're encouraged at this point, but pretty early still. Yes. I would just encourage you maybe to go back and look at our Analyst Day presentation. I had a building block slide in that presentation that walked us from kind of where we -- where our guidance was for the end of 2020 to a 12% margin rate perspective. And I think it does show a little bit of -- kind of how gross margin might perform as well as how SG&A is going to perform. And again, this is largely about, in aggregate, gross margin rates being relatively flat and us improving our SG&A performance across the business. And Kate, I'll just add that we look at it a little bit the opposite. We are underpenetrated, but that is the big opportunity we have. And all the investments we're making is going to allow us to really accelerate in that business segment pretty significantly over the next several years. Michael, it's Dave here. Clearly, what we're doing is we're working really diligently to improve the productivity across our business. And Joe has kicked off a pretty major effort to do that. But we're doing it really across all segments of our operation. \n That's probably a little bit more specific guidance, if you will, so we're probably not going to go there. But I'll just say that as a management team and as a business, we're controlling what we can control. We're making sure that as we look at these sales scenarios over time is that we're improving our operating income performance. And we're dead set on improving that. We're very focused and adamant about going after that. And I think we have a very good line of sight to that. Well, listen, we're focused in a few different areas. We've just enhanced our pricing and promotional tools, from a merchandising perspective. I think the merchants have just kind of taken a step back and looked at, from a promotional cadence perspective, how to think of more of an EDLP type environment, at the same time going out and negotiating special buys in certain areas to drive real value from a consumer perspective. I think we're getting a lot more efficient on how we layer in and out of our online business to drive both top line and improve profitability. At the same time, we do need to manage our supply chain to be more efficient as we think about same day, next day deliveries to the home and to the job site. \n So all those levers are things that we're working on that we're actively using to manage our gross margin performance. And yes, we do have some headwinds, but we're also -- that's part of our job is to manage those headwinds to improve performance over time. And again, with a real focus, once again, Michael, on improving our operating income flow through, that's the opportunity we have. Chris, Dave here. Yes, I do think stimulus, as we cycled into the new year, did help our comps. We estimate somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points from that perspective. I think as stimulus has gone on for a while now, I think the performance and the impact of it has been -- has moderated a little bit. So I think we do see it -- when those trap checks do hit, we do see an inflection kind of up a little bit, but it has not been nearly as dramatic as it was when it first hit basically a year or so ago. I think that's a little bit more specific than probably what we could give you some color on at this point in time. I'd just say that at the end of the day, back to Marvin's point, is our focus this year taking market share, improving operating income. That's just are 2 things that we're focused on just consistently, and you'll continue to hear us talk about that, demonstrate our performance in those 2 metrics. Yes. Eric, I would say that it should expand a little bit in upside scenario, just given what we've done in 2020, to your point. \n So great. So Rob, with that, we're going to take one more question, please. So yes, largely, the inflation has been centered primarily in the lumber category. If you think about it from that perspective, and again, about 300 basis points. This is -- from a commodity standpoint, this is something that we're very used to managing. And largely, those are passed on ultimately to the consumer at the store. Yes. I don't know that off the top of my head. But obviously, inflation in the back half of the year was higher than the first half of the year, so it's certainly less than 300 basis points. And we'll keep -- obviously, we'll keep -- we watch it daily."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. We delivered U.S. home improvement comparable sales growth of 28.6% in the fourth quarter. And consistent with the trends we've seen since the second quarter, growth was broad-based across both DIY and Pro customers, in-store and online and across all merchandising departments. In fact, all 15 merchandising departments generated positive comps of over 16%.  \n Great execution, combined with our compelling product offering of well-known national brands, balanced with high-value private brands, ensured that we were well positioned to meet the continued elevated demand for home-related projects during the quarter. \n Lumber was, once again, the top performer, driven by strong unit demand across Pro and DIY customers, as well as commodity inflation. Our merchants and our supply chain teams did an exceptional job in working with our vendor partners to keep up with demand and to ensure that our stores were stocked with job lot quantities. \n Several other categories posted comps above 30%, including building materials, which was driven by strong demand for roofing and gutters. An improved level of in-stock and an exceptional customer service have allowed us to continue to grow our Pro business in these Pro-focused building product categories. \n Our seasonal and outdoor living, lawn and garden and paint categories also delivered comps above 30% in the quarter, reflecting the consumers' continued focus on the home. Our seasonal and outdoor living team delivered a successful holiday season with a holiday trim a tree program that exceeded the customers' expectations. The team also leveraged our selection in key brands to drive strong sales in grills, patio heaters and fire pits, as these categories were strong throughout the quarter as consumers continue to enjoy their outdoor spaces. \n Outdoor power equipment was driven by sales of chore-related product, such as snowblowers, generators and pressure washers, as customers navigated the weather and worked to maintain their outdoor areas. \n Continuing the theme of enhancing the outdoors, we saw strength in lawn and garden, with notable outperformance in holiday-related live nursery, along with growth in hardscapes, outdoor planters and cleaning products.  \n And finally, our paint category also continued its strong performance with both interior and exterior stains delivering strong comps as the weather early in the quarter remained favorable. \n Now turning to our online results. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered sales growth of 121% on Lowes.com, our third consecutive quarter with over 100% comps online. And during the quarter, we continued to enhance the user experience as we simplified the search and checkout features to speed up the process for customers shopping online. \n And we are also now working on replatforming LowesForPros to the cloud to be completed in the first half of this year, which will significantly enhance the features that we offer to these time-pressed customers and then further build out our loyalty with the Pro.  \n As we discussed last quarter, we have been resetting the layout of our U.S. stores with approximately 95% of our resets now complete. We expect to drive greater sales productivity per square foot by achieving 3 key objectives with this investment. First, driving Pro sales through a more intuitive and faster shopping experience as we've now placed relevant products adjacent to each other and added a Pro flex area for grab-and-go products at the front of the store.  \n Second, increasing our localized product assortment by eliminating unproductive bays without planograms or what we call junk bays, which now opens up space for new products, better tailored to the local market. And then finally, third, driving more transactions by moving the basket-building category of cleaning products to the main power aisle of the store.  \n We're confident that our stores are now easier to shop for both Pro and DIY customers, which positions us well to accelerate our market share gains. I'd like to offer my sincere appreciation to all the teams across the company who work so diligently to execute on this strategic initiative in such a short period of time. \n We also continue to elevate our brand and product offerings. We are continuing to build on our position as the leading appliance retailer in the U.S. with the addition of Midea and Hisense appliances to our stores. \n And Lowe's will soon become the exclusive home improvement provider of Mansfield plumbing products. This addition will make Lowe's the only home improvement retailer to offer customers the top 3 toilet brands in the U.S.: Kohler, American Standard and Mansfield.  \n As we transition to spring, we're in a great position to safely serve customers, and our teams have already been preparing by completing our new spring sets as we anticipate the arrival of the season around the country. \n Leveraging our leading position in outdoor power equipment, we have a wide selection from EGO, the top-selling brand in battery-powered OPE, to John Deere, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Honda and Aaron's. In addition, we will have a terrific selection of patio furniture, including our refreshed allen + roth patio program, complemented by a wide array of grills as we continue to leverage the 2 leading brands in outdoor grilling, Weber and Char-Broil. \n We're confident that our products will inspire customers that are looking to upgrade their outdoor space, which we think will continue to remain a retreat for many this spring season.  \n We're continuing to make changes to improve traffic flow within our outdoor garden centers to ensure social distancing while shopping, as well as showcasing inspirational vignettes and utilizing enhanced vendor support, all of which will drive a great spring season in lawn and garden. \n And finally, we are excited to deliver new innovation in flooring with the launch of Pergo WetProtect technology available in laminate, engineered wood and rigid luxury vinyl, and offering guaranteed protection for both the flooring and subflooring. This new level of total moisture protection is a great Lowe's exclusive product that will provide peace of mind for consumers and further differentiate our flooring offering. \n This spring, we will demonstrate to consumers that we provide everything they need to make their homes and backyards functional and safe, a reflection of our Total Home strategy. I'm looking forward to sharing more with you about our reimagined approach to spring on our next call.  \n And before I close, I'd like to express my thanks for the resilience and dedication showed by our merchants and vendor partners during what was truly an extraordinary year as these teams work tirelessly to meet the high levels of demand for our products and services. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Michael, this is Bill. I'll just add a couple of comments to that. As we've said over the last couple of years, we've been on a journey to get to more of an everyday competitive price. And so getting credit for what we're doing and less of this high-low approach that we had been typically on prior to this leadership team coming in. And then we have done a lot of work in the last 18 months around our localization initiative, and it's one of our key unlocks and part of our Total Home strategy as we go forward that gives us the opportunity from a margin perspective as well. So we're confident that we can deliver on what we said back in December."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. This past year presented challenges that few of us could have imagined. Lowe's has always been at the forefront in responding to crisis in our communities, and our associates rose to the challenge once again in 2020. \n In recognition of the outstanding efforts of our associates, in January, we announced a bonus of $300 for each full-time associate and $150 for each part-time associate. This $80 million bonus brought the total COVID-related assistance to our associates to over $900 million in 2020. \n And I could not be more pleased to announce today that for the fourth quarter in a row, 100% of our stores are under \"Winning Together\" profit-sharing bonus totaling $90 million. And because of their efforts, once again exceeded expectations, this represents an incremental $30 million over the target payment level. \n And we're supporting our communities again through hiring as we bring on more than 50,000 seasonal and full-time retail associates this spring to ensure that our customers get the exceptional service they expect from Lowe's. This builds on the more than 90,000 associates hired into permanent roles over the past year. \n 2020 changed the way the customers shop with Lowe's. Nowhere is this more evident than the 111% sales growth on Lowes.com for the year. And with roughly 60% of these online orders fulfilled in our stores, we needed to dramatically expand our fulfillment capabilities to support this increased demand. We began by rapidly rolling out curbside pickup in the first quarter, and then we began to launch touchless BOPIS lockers in our stores a few months later.  \n We now have BOPIS lockers in over 1,200 stores with the goal of rolling out lockers to all U.S. stores by April. Providing multiple contactless pickup options for our customers, we are meeting consumer demands to shop Lowe's in whatever way they choose. \n And we've continued to enhance the mobile app to improve the customer pickup experience. This quarter, we began rolling out geofencing technology that alerts our stores when customers are on their way to pick up their orders, enabling quicker fulfillment when they arrive at the store. \n Last quarter, we announced that we were standing up dedicated fulfillment teams to handle all in-store fulfillment orders. All of these enhancements from the easy-to-use BOPIS lockers and the new geofencing technology, to the focus on the fulfillment teams, have already driven improvements in customer satisfaction and speed of service. \n Importantly, the fulfillment teams are also improving productivity as they leverage enhancements that we've made to the picking app. This is evidenced by a dramatic reduction in the number of hours needed to fulfill orders for pickup. In fact, we can now fulfill orders 6x faster on average than 1 year ago. \n Now let's turn to our performance with the Pro. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered mid-20s comps in the fourth quarter. We continue to enhance our Pro loyalty offering by providing Pros with the tools they need to get the job done. This time of the year, our Pros are focused on not only their project pipeline, but they also need to close their books just like any other business.  \n As a true partner to the Pro, we are now providing our Pro loyalty members with a $100 discount on TurboTax. Our Pro loyalty members can also export up to 24 months of transaction history, expediting their year-end close process. It's value-added offers like these that truly differentiate our Pro loyalty offering. \n Throughout 2020, we continue to raise the bar on our offering for the Pro, with better service levels, the right brands and products and the job lot quantities they need. Every day, we are demonstrating that Lowe's is executing our commitment to be the new home for Pros, which is reflected in the strong repeat rates that we're earning from new and existing customers.\n I'd like to offer a special thanks to the entire Pro team for a fantastic year. Job well done. And I'm looking forward to building on this momentum as we continue to grow our Pro penetration. \n And one way that will drive greater Pro penetration is through our newly launched Pro customer relationship management, or CRM tool. Rolled out to all stores in late January, this new technology provides our Pro desk with the tools to manage, grow and retain Pro accounts through consistent and data-driven selling actions. We will also be able to associate any transaction regardless of tender type to a specific Pro account, allowing us for better record-keeping for their business.  \n Store associate training is currently underway, and we expect that the targeted outreach enabled by this tool will facilitate stronger and more personal relationships with our Pro customers. \n Over the past few years, the store operations team has made considerable strides in improving productivity in our stores, with technology enhancements that free up our associates to spend more time in the aisles serving customers. \n As we move into 2021, we are kicking off a new productivity initiative in-store operations that we are calling our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI. This key productivity initiative will play a critical role in our continued multiyear improvement in operating profit. \n Through PPI, we will leverage new processes and technology to deliver continuous productivity enhancements. Some of the most significant technology initiatives under PPI are modernized checkout infrastructure, industry-leading in-store workforce management tools, new touchscreen POS, expanded rollout of digital signs, incremental functionality deployed to the handheld devices and enhanced store inventory management systems, to name a few.  \n These perpetual productivity improvements will help us to move toward our multiyear goal of achieving $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion in store OpEx productivity that we set at the December investor update. I look forward to updating you on the progress we are making towards these important productivity initiatives on future calls. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. Thanks, Marvin. And Seth, thank you for the question. You're correct, from Q3 to Q4, we did see a nice comp acceleration. We're excited about the underlying demand in the Pro space. As we look at the kind of robust pipeline that's out there in the Pro space, thinking about the expanded product offerings that we've had throughout the year. In addition, I mentioned in my prepared comments, the benefit from TurboTax and the progress that we're making to help these Pros expedite their year-end close. \n And then in addition, we've been focused on all the fundamentals. And as we continue to move forward, confident that things like our U.S. stores reset and the area that we created for Pros and the ease of Pros to shop. In addition, very excited about the growth of our new Pro loyalty platform, along with the integrated CRM that rolls out. And very excited about what's happening inside the Pro business. So Kate, it's Joe, and thanks for the question. I'll just add a few things to what Marvin said. And over the last 2 years, we've been taking steps from a store operation standpoint to simplify the store structure, if you think about some of the updates we've given, our 4 levels of sales associate on the sales floor and all the work we've done. And so in addition, the labor management tools and the workforce management initiatives the team has laid out, I feel very good about the balance of ticket and transactions in our transaction-based labor model, and that will continue, to be able to deliver on the operational efficiency we need to. \n And then finally, for the spring hiring season, we feel that we've done a nice job addressing any difficult-to-hire markets. We measure the pipeline of sales associates coming in by position by market, so we've made adjustments where we need to and feel confident going forward. Yes, Karen, this is Joe. And thank you for the question. We will be migrating our credit platforms and our Pro loyalty platforms together. We have every intention. That is a part of -- it's a huge part of the benefit. Again, we've been very encouraged by the new sign-ups in Pro loyalty, how the Pro customers are responding. We've been very pleased also with our new credit acquisition from a Pro standpoint. And so with those underlying themes, although we won't release the number of Pros, we're excited about what the platform is delivering and all the work that the Pro team has done."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe's Companies Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  \n I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Dave Denton, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2020. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.  \n Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in this morning's press release and on our Investor Relations website.  \n Before we discuss our third quarter results, I would like to announce that we will be hosting a virtual investor update on Wednesday, December 9, from 8 to 10 a.m. Eastern Time. Marvin will discuss several growth opportunities that are expected to facilitate further market share gains. Dave will discuss our opportunities to drive operating efficiencies and sustainable shareholder value, and he will also provide an update on our financial targets. After our prepared remarks, we will host a Q&A session. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start out by taking a moment to extend my thoughts and prayers to all the individuals and communities impacted by the many wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no doubt that this has been a very challenging year for many of us. \n Although our Lowe's associates are dealing with the same challenges facing the rest of the country, I continue to be inspired by their commitment to serve our customers and communities while juggling a multitude of pressures and obstacles at home. \n Throughout all the uncertainty we face, we continue to be guided by 3 key priorities. First, our highest priority as a company will always be protecting the health and safety of our associates and customers through a safe store environment and shopping experience. And we believe that our strict in-store safety and social distancing protocols implemented in a consistent, uniform manner has built trust with our customers.  \n Our second priority remains providing support for our community, including health care providers and first responders. And our third priority is financially supporting our associates during this challenging time.  \n In support of these priorities, we've invested an incremental $245 million in the third quarter to support our associates. We've now invested more than $1.1 billion in COVID-related support for our associates, store safety initiatives and communities through the first 9 months of this year.  \n Now turning to our results. For the quarter, we delivered total company comparable sales growth of 30.1% over the prior year and 40% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.98. At the same time, we're also making critical investments across our operations to position the company for long-term growth.  \n Our U.S. home improvement comps was 30.4% driven by consistent and strong project demand from both DIY and Pro customers throughout the quarter. In a continuation of trends from Q2, growth was broad-based across channels, product categories and geographies. In fact, growth exceeded 15% across all merchandising departments, 20% across all geographic regions and triple digits on Lowes.com.  \n DIY comps again outpaced Pro comps in the quarter driven by a consumer mindset that remain focused on the redesigning the functionality of their home. Consistent with the redefinition, in the third quarter, customers continued to shop at Lowe's as they took steps to shift their home to serve 3 primary purposes: a home school, a home office and their primary location for recreation and entertainment. We're pleased that customers continue to choose Lowe's as a retail of choice for these very important projects.  \n Our Pro business remained strong in the third quarter with comps exceeding 20%. Our investments to improve our product and service offerings and overall customer experience is resonating with the Pro customers. We're seeing a significant number of new Pro customers rediscover Lowe's, and we're seeing them come back to buy from us over and over again. We're well positioned to continue to attract new Pro customers while also growing share of wallet with existing Pro customers.  \n We launched a significant merchandising investment in the third quarter to reset the footprint of our U.S. stores, shifting to a project-focused versus a product-focused store layout. We believe these changes will create a more intuitive shopping experience for our customers, especially to Pro. And we redesigned the layout of our stores to improve product adjacencies and bay productivity with the goal of increasing sales per square foot. Bill will provide more detail on this very important reset initiative in a moment.  \n From a geographic perspective, we had broad-based growth with positive comparable sales growth exceeding 20% across all 15 geographic regions and all 3 U.S. divisions. Regions that outperformed the total company comps were Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and New York. \n We also continued to see strong sales trends in urban areas. In fact, comp sales in our urban markets outperformed remote or rural markets by over 500 basis points. Our strength in our urban markets reflects the improvements we've made to our product and service offerings for the Pro customer as well as enhanced omnichannel capabilities to serve customers increasingly shopping online.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 106% as we continue to see an increase in both DIY and Pro customer demand for contactless shopping options. We have made tremendous progress over the last 2 years with the right investments to improve our omnichannel retailing capabilities, enabling us to meet the ever-increasing expectations of customers to shop whatever way they choose.  \n And we continue to invest in our supply chain network as we opened new cross-dock delivery terminals, bulk distribution centers and e-commerce fulfillment centers to expand our fulfillment capabilities.  \n And while we've seen exponential online growth this year, we still have tremendous growth runway in front of us as Lowes.com business is meaningfully underpenetrated, with online representing only 7% of our sales. Supported by our modern cloud-based platform, our talented dot-com and technology team has a detailed road map towards becoming a best-in-class omnichannel retailer.  \n Turning to Canada. We posted positive comps that exceeded 25%, supported by strong Pro and DIY demand as well as early success implementing our retail fundamentals playbook to improve operating efficiency while driving sales. This was a very important quarter for us as we drove strong top line results while continuing to make significant investments across merchandising, Lowes.com, store operations and supply chain that will enable us to capitalize on current trends and will position us as a company to drive sustainable growth.  \n 2020 has demonstrated to all of us how quickly shopping behaviors can change. And I'm proud of the agility that we've shown to adjust our business model to serve an unprecedented number of customers in store and on Lowes.com. We also understand that agility will be important as we hopefully pivot to a post-COVID retail environment later in 2021. \n However, we understand that creating an efficient and world-class omnichannel experience will determine retail winners and retail losers in the future. Therefore, we're pleased with the current development of our omnichannel strategy thus far and remain committed to making the necessary investments to provide our customers with choices to shop any way they choose. And over the near term, our investment thesis will remain laser-focused on enhancing the growth and profitability of our core retail business.  \n Before I close, I'd like to again express my sincere appreciation for the tremendous efforts of our associates to support our customers and communities when they need us most. The country continues to face significant challenges presented by COVID-19, and this is still a very unpredictable business environment. However, our #1 priority as an essential business will always be supporting the health and safety of our associates and our customers.  \n I look forward to speaking with you again at our investor update on December 9 with a discussion focused on the market share growth opportunities that lie ahead of us.  \n With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. As Marvin mentioned, we posted U.S. home improvement comparable sales growth of 30.4% in the third quarter. Our continued strong execution, combined with elevated brand and product offerings, enabled us to effectively serve the sustained increase in customer demand driven by the increased importance that customers are placing on their homes.  \n Similar to the second quarter, growth was broad-based across both DIY and Pro customers, in-store and online, and across all merchandising departments. In fact, all 15 merchandising departments generated positive comps exceeded 15%. Lumber led the way, again driven by strong unit demand across Pro and DIY customers, supported by our continued investments in job lot quantities, and the strength of our merchants and our supply chain teams in sourcing these high-demand products.  \n In addition to lumber, we delivered above-average comps in decor, lawn and garden, and seasonal and outdoor living. Within decor, our growth was driven largely by the strength in furniture, including accent furniture and accessories, along with the strong results in home organization, as customers continue to update and create new spaces for home offices and remote schooling.  \n In lawn and garden, there was broad-based strength across the business, though most notably within live goods and landscape products, as customers actively engaged in outdoor landscaping and other fall exterior projects. Our seasonal and outdoor living team also delivered comps above the company average this quarter driven by customers looking to extend their outdoor entertaining space, with fire pits and patio heaters being the accelerated product category for this fall.\n We continue to strengthen our position as the #1 destination for outdoor power equipment with the recent addition of EGO, which is the top-selling brand in battery-powered outdoor power equipment, to our all-star lineup, which includes John Deere, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Honda and the Ariens brands. And we continue to leverage our other powerhouse brands like Weber and Char-Broil, which continues to be the top 2 brands in outdoor grilling.  \n Now turning to our online results. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered sales growth of 106% on Lowes.com. With the replatforming of Lowes.com to the cloud, we have been rapidly deploying enhancements to deliver a better customer experience, including enhanced online delivery scheduling, so that customers can more efficiently self-serve and select the delivery time that is most convenient for them or easily reschedule as the need arises.  \n We also made it easier to shop by product collection with over 500 collections and growing. So customers can now purchase a patio set without it involving a time-consuming search for each individual item.\n I'm also excited that we now have the capability to ship products that require special handling, items like lithium-ion batteries. This capability now enables us to handle online orders of EGO, Kobalt and Skill battery-powered products, along with other products powered by lithium batteries or items that may require care in shipping and handling.  \n And as Marvin covered in his opening remarks, we are resetting the footprint of the store, so that's more intuitive shopping experience for our customers, especially for the Pro. For example, the reflow of our rough plumbing and electrical aisles are 2 key areas for the Pro that needed to reflect how the Pro shops. We are now placing all of the relevant products adjacent to each other, such as pipe cement next to pipe and the necessary fittings next to their respective pipe category.\n We are also eliminating merchandising bays without planograms. We call these junk bays, thus opening up space for higher-velocity, higher-demand items and categories that will better reflect the local market. We are on track to have the reset complete for over 90% of our stores by fiscal year-end.  \n And as part of this store reset, there'll be 2 other noticeable changes. First, we are adding a Pro-Flex area, similar to what we did earlier this year in our seasonal areas, making it easier for the Pro to grab and go. And then second, we are moving the cleaning category to the main or the first aisle of our stores. This is just another example of ways we are working to improve the productivity in this highly visible area of the store.  \n And as we look to close out the year, we are building on our momentum around the holiday season that began with our first-ever drive-through, curbside trick-or-treating event at our stores, where we gave away candy and pumpkins to hundreds of thousands of families who are excited about the holidays but may not have had the same door-to-door trick or treating available in their neighborhoods as in years past. \n And we feel that this will be a holiday season like no other, when our customers will no doubt be spending much more time at home. And because of that, we're helping our customers invest in the time and memories that they're creating at home. And we're planning to deliver a season of savings for the holidays over an extended period to avoid creating congestion in our stores.  \n Consistent with our approach throughout 2020, we continue to expect reduced promotional activity compared to the prior year. Overall, we've delivered outstanding results this year, and I can't say enough about the unbelievable efforts of our vendor partners and our merchants who have worked extremely hard to keep up with the unprecedented demand.  \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. This year, we faced operational challenges unlike anything I've encountered in my career, whether it's in response to a hurricane, flood, tornado or global health crisis, Lowe's associates take pride in the role they play to keep families safe in their homes and businesses running in challenging times. Our associates have also remained steadfast in their commitment to providing a safe shopping experience in our stores so our customers feel comfortable returning for another shopping trip to Lowe's.  \n In recognition of the outstanding efforts of our team, we have provided financial support to our hourly associates with 2 additional $100 million bonuses this quarter. Full-time associates received $300 and part-time associates received $150 in each payment, while Lowe's covered the cost of the tax gross-up again. This brings our total COVID-related financial assistance to our associates to over $800 million this year.  \n And I'm thrilled to announce that for the third quarter in a row, 100% of our stores have earned their \"Winning Together\" profit-sharing bonus totaling $104 million. Once again, their efforts exceeded expectations, so this represents an incremental $31 million over the target payment level.  \n I was also really pleased to see the strong frontline associate morale, reflected in their impressive level of engagement in our recent annual associate survey. Our associates indicated that they feel supported by the company during this challenging year and that they are energized by their work. \n And we're supporting our communities through hiring as we're bringing on 20,000 associates across our U.S. stores and distribution centers this holiday season to support elevated levels of customer demand. This year, we've hired over 155,000 associates through our seasonal hiring programs, and many of these seasonal hires have transitioned to a more permanent role within the company.  \n The pandemic has changed the way we all live, work and shop. This is evident in our increased customer demand for contactless shopping options this year. This quarter, we began adding touchless BOPIS lockers to our stores to complement our curbside pickup and BOPIS pickup at checkout. We're focused on rolling out these lockers to our major metro markets by Thanksgiving. And we are standing up dedicated fulfillment teams at our stores who are already improving speed of service and customer satisfaction with their consistent focus on this important function.  \n We're also raising our game with the Pro as we expand our brand and product offerings to meet their unique needs. We are adding to our Eaton electrical product assortment, which is a go-to solution for the Pro working on a home remodeling project. And we are now the largest distribution partner for SharkBite, which provides push-to-connect plumbing products that make projects fast and easy, a must-have for any plumbing project.  \n Combined with the power of Simpson Strong-Tie, DEWALT, Spyder and Bosch brands, this broader offering in Eaton and SharkBite builds out our arsenal to ensure that we have a competitive offering that meets the needs of our Pros across the variety of projects that they handle.  \n And we kicked off a multiyear national rollout of our tool rental program to increase our relevance with the Pro, as over 70% of Pros rent tools at least once a year. In August, we celebrated the grand opening of our first tool rental location in Charlotte, where we provide high-quality tools for both Pros, DIYs and weekend warriors through a convenient online platform that allows customers to reserve their tools ahead of time. We are encouraged by the early results and the strong feedback from our most frequent Pro customers in the Charlotte area.  \n Looking at our third quarter results. I'm really pleased with the comps exceeding 20% that the Pro team delivered. We are consistently meeting the needs of our Pro customers with job lot quantities that are available every week, efficient service focused on getting them back on the job site quickly and the products they're looking for. We're winning new Pro customers, and they're coming back to our stores again and again.  \n And we continue to drive efficiency by streamlining our store operations as we leverage technology to improve customer service and alleviate the task and responsibilities for our Red Vest associates. \n This quarter, we leveraged the new intuitive touchscreen POS at our registers to easily cross-train other associates on the cashier position. These new touchscreen registers not only speed up cashier training from the old green screens, they also provide our customers with a faster checkout experience. This is consistent with our store simplification approach, which leverages new technology to make our associates more productive while also improving customer service at the same time.  \n With all these store technology processes and improvements under our belt, we are well on our way to hit our target of 60% service and 40% tasking by the end of the year. And it's paying off with high customer satisfaction scores as we acquire new customers who keep coming back to shop at Lowe's.  \n Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Dave. \nDavid Denton: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin this morning outlining the company's strong capital allocation program. In the first 9 months of 2020, we generated $10.3 billion in free cash flow driven by very strong operating performance. In the third quarter alone, we paid $416 million in dividends. We also announced a dividend of $0.60 per share, a 9% increase that will be paid in the fourth quarter of this year.  \n During the quarter, we reinstated our share repurchase program and repurchased 3.6 million shares in the open market for $621 million. I continue to expect our share repurchase program to be a significant contributor to long-term shareholder value creation. We incurred capital expenditures of $462 million as we invest in the business to support our strategic initiatives, including our omnichannel capabilities.  \n In October, we took advantage of a favorable interest rate environment to reduce our interest expense through a cash tender offer for $3 billion of our higher coupon bonds. As a result, we recognized a loss of $1.1 billion on the extinguishment of debt.  \n To fund the tender offer, we issued $4 billion of unsecured notes. This issuance consisted of 7-, 10- and 30-year notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.17%, which is a record low in the company's history. These efforts further strengthen our capital position by lowering our interest expense over the longer term. \n We now have $8.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. And combined with $3 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities, we have immediate access to $11.2 billion in funds, which we are confident is more than enough liquidity to navigate any uncertainty. At the end of Q3, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.3x.  \n Now turning to the income statement. In Q3, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91 compared to $1.36 last year, a decrease of 33%. And as I just mentioned, the company incurred a $1.1 billion loss on debt extinguishment this quarter.  \n Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons, where applicable. In Q3, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.98 per share, an increase of 40% compared to the prior year. These results were driven by higher-than-expected sales volume as well as our strong execution to meet elevated customer demands. \n Q3 sales were $22.3 billion, an increase of 30.1% on a comparable basis versus the prior year. This is driven by transaction growth of 16.4% and comparable sales average ticket growth of 13.7%. We continue to see strong repeat rates from both new and existing customers. \n Commodity inflation drove a benefit of approximately 340 basis points to comps in the quarter. U.S. comp sales were up 30.4% in the quarter, with continued strength from both DIY and Pro customers and broad-based demand across geographies, merchandising departments and selling channels. Our U.S. monthly comps were consistently strong throughout the quarter with 28.9% in August, 31.8% in September and 30% in October despite a significant reduction in promotional activity versus LY.  \n Gross margin was 32.7% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 28 basis points compared to the third quarter of '19. Product gross margin rate improved 65 basis points driven by continued improvements from our pricing, cost management and promotional strategies. Favorable product mix drove approximately 35 basis points of benefit. These benefits were offset by 30 basis points of headwind from lower credit revenue, 25 basis points of pressure from inventory shrink and 20 basis points of pressure from supply chain cost.  \n And consistent with our long-term strategy, we are investing in our supply chain as we expand our network to stand up market-level delivery model for big and bulky products. We further expanded capacity for parcel shipments with the opening of a new direct fulfillment center on the West Coast.  \n SG&A was 21.4% of sales in Q3, a 31 basis point improvement compared to LY. As we anticipated, we incurred $290 million of COVID-related expenses. These investments included $230 million in financial assistance for our frontline associates and approximately $55 million related to both cleaning and other safety-related programs, and approximately $5 million in charitable contributions. \n These $290 million of COVID-related expenses negatively impacted SG&A leverage by 130 basis points. We also incurred approximately $100 million in a large-scale strategic merchandising reset of our U.S. stores, which negatively impacted SG&A leverage by 45 basis points.  \n These incremental costs were partially offset by payroll leverage of 90 basis points related to higher sales volume and improved store operating efficiencies, occupancy leverage of 35 basis points, 35 basis points of leverage in employee benefits and advertising leverage of 25 basis points. Adjusted operating income margin increased 55 basis points to 9.81% of sales. The adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% was in line with the prior year.  \n Now Q3 benefited from a $0.02 timing shift into Q3 at the expense of Q4. At $15.7 billion, inventory was higher compared to the prior year levels as we stocked up on product to meet elevated customer demand throughout the quarter. Also, lumber inflation increased inventory values by approximately $250 million.  \n I'd now like to spend just a few minutes discussing our outlook for the fourth quarter. While the operating environment remains uncertain and we still have limited visibility into the longer-term trends, I'd like to share my perspectives about how we are planning the business in Q4. We expect that our top line growth will moderate from Q3 levels as outperformance in seasonal categories abates in the fourth quarter. This is consistent with natural demand patterns of the home improvement sector.  \n For the quarter, we expect total and comparable sales growth of between 15% and 20%. Consistent with the prior 2 quarters, we anticipate that we will incur ongoing COVID-related operating expenses of approximately $75 million to support safety and cleanliness in our stores. In Q4, we will continue to evaluate the operating environment and assess any potential incremental associate financial assistance. \n We expect to incur approximately $150 million in expenses associated with the merchandising investment in our stores as we expect to complete the reset activity for over 90% of our U.S. stores by the end of the fourth quarter.  \n Additionally, we will continue to invest in expanding our supply chain network. These significant investments, coupled with our fourth quarter typically being our smallest revenue quarter, should result in adjusted operating margin performance essentially flat to prior year levels. The effective tax rate is expected to be over 27%.  \n Continuing our commitment to return capital to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases, our guidance assumes approximately $3 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We expect GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.20 a share. For adjusted EPS, this represents 22% growth at the midpoint over the prior year. We are now planning for approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures for the year with a continued focus on our omnichannel investments.  \n In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our outstanding results for the first 9 months of the year. In an unprecedented operating environment, we remain focused on serving our customers and our communities, which led to an opportunity to grow market share earlier than we expected.  \n I remain confident that we are making the right investments to drive sustainable growth. We have a strong balance sheet and we are committed to a disciplined capital allocation program, which will lead to a longer-term shareholder value creation. I look forward to speaking with you again soon at our investor update meeting on December 9. \n So with that, I thank you. We are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I have a question, Marvin, if you step back and look at the transformation so far since you've gotten there and your ability to get to 12% margins and beyond. I know the stock is down a little bit this morning, and I think it's reflecting maybe a mismatch in timing of some investments and flow-through. But it doesn't look like much has changed with your goals and the path you're on, but I wanted to ask you if there's anything that you can be critical of that's something that's not playing out. Or is your reaction that things should only be stronger for Lowe's than what you envisioned when you got to Lowe's? \nMarvin Ellison: Simeon, this is a very good question. We actually feel great about the transformation. I mean, obviously, we don't have perfect visibility to the future and we had no idea, as no one did, that we'd be dealing with a global pandemic in the year 2020. But when I think about how far we've progressed in 2 years, when you look at the digital platform and our online business, the last 2 quarters growing 135%; last quarter, 106%. In the third quarter, we were at levels that we could not have even imagined just 12 to 16 months ago, merchandising initiatives, supply chain. \n I think the key for us is that we're not really concerned about the short term. We know this is a great brand, we have a strong balance sheet and we're trying to make the right investments in the future. When I look around at the accomplishments of the team, I'm exceptionally proud because we're a little bit ahead of schedule, as Dave mentioned. And we think that we're going to start to lean into taking market share. \n And at the December 9 investor update, we're going to be a lot more specific about kind of where we are in this transformation and how we see the out-years and where we believe that we can really start to pick up additional market share. But overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the progress of this team. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And a quick follow-up is, I think year-to-date, we've incurred about $1.1 billion of COVID associate benefits and additional costs. How do we think about that into the fourth quarter and into 2021? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, I'll take the first part and see if Dave has any additional context. Dave mentioned that we're committed to fundamental expenses relative to cleaning and providing a safe environment for our associates and customers in our physical stores. And so that is something that we are committed to continuing to execute. \n We're going to just monitor all other aspects of the needs of our associates and determine what, if any, additional investments need to be made in the fourth quarter. We've actually followed that philosophy for the last couple of quarters, and the fourth quarter won't be any different.  \n I don't know if Dave has anything to add. \nDavid Denton: Yes. Simeon, this is Dave. The only thing I would add to that is that, obviously, in November, the associates will receive incremental compensation. And then in December, our \"Winning Together\" program kicks into play. And just given how the stores are performing, the vast majority if not almost all the stores are at max payout from that. So we're leaning into areas to compensate our associates tied to their needs but also tied to performance. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if I could ask about Pro versus DIY, just if you saw a narrowing of the gap in performance between the 2 this quarter versus last quarter. And how should we be thinking about the Pro penetration in sales next year once you reset the store and leverage some of the initiatives that you've put in place the last year or 2? \nMarvin Ellison: Kate, it's really difficult for us to give you a very specific forecast on that. Obviously, this is the most difficult environment for any kind of a financial forecast. But I think at a high level, we anticipate that you're going to see that gap continue to close and the Pros will start to gain more of a penetration as we start to have less of the nesting effect when we get to this post-COVID environment. \n One of the reasons we're making all of these investments in the Pro, and as Joe and I both mentioned, I mean we grew the business over 20% in the third quarter, is because we're anticipating this post-COVID retail environment and we know this customer is very important for us. So we expect that gap to continue to close as we get into 2021. The question is when and that's going to be, in large part, based on COVID and how the nesting effect of the DIY starts to minimize over time. \nDavid Denton: And Kate, this is Dave. I'd just add that if we step back and think about the financial algorithm of this company over the next several years, as we've said many times, we real strength in the DIY customer. You're seeing that in our numbers today. The opportunity over time is to really penetrate and grow our Pro business. And I think the investments we're making both in Q3 and Q4, and really as we cycle into next year, is really bolstering our business model around the Pro. \n And so it's not going to be like a light switch that we're going to just turn on and the Pro is going to just elevate significantly, but this is each week and each month and each quarter kind of continue to push and grind ourselves out to grow that Pro business. And that's the objective we have here. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And if I could just ask a quick unrelated follow-up, just with the news in the MRO space this week. I just wondered if you could remind us how you're thinking about your competitive positioning within the MRO segment. And does that change this week change anything when you think about supply chain investment for Lowe's? \nMarvin Ellison: Kate, it does not. I made the comment earlier in my prepared comments that we're committed to the core retail business. When we look at our investment thesis and we evaluate where we can gain the greatest return, it is in our core business. \n Now we're going to continue to target the MRO segment in our current Pro strategy with our outside sales reps, but those reps are connected to the store and connected to our MSH model. And we feel like that, that model has the ability to scale. But our investment thesis, our focus, is improving our core business. And our core business is defined as our brick-and-mortar stores, our dot-com platform, our supply chain and all the other operational components that tie that together. And that's our omnichannel philosophy. \n We feel like we're in a good position, and we're going to continue to make those investments. And over time, that thesis may change. But in the short term and near term, we're just laser-focused on our core business. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: Another expense-related question. I guess looking for some clarity, just in terms of kind of the way to think about the cadence. So pre-pandemic, the Lowe's story was very heavily centered on productivity improvements, SG&A leverage. Obviously, as COVID hit, you've incurred a lot of incremental expenses, COVID assistance for your associates, obviously, extra labor because of sales growth. How should we think about SG&A growth on, let's call it, a per-store basis? Or how are you going to frame it for '21, just in terms of the way we should think about those overall levels? \nDavid Denton: Yes. It's probably a little early to talk specifically about '21. But just in general, I think what you're seeing is we have a very focused effort around store productivity and managing both labor and costs within our stores. Couple that with the investments that we're making in supply chain, which is ultimately creating a market-based delivery model, that will ultimately put pressure a little bit on gross margin as we take delivery out of the stores, move it into the market, but relieve the stores of that burden from an SG&A perspective. So you'll see incremental flow-through as that model gets built out. \n That's probably a 12-, 18-, 24-month process before that happens. But I think we're well on our way to continue to make investments, both from a technology perspective and an operational improvement perspective to drive productivity. So you should see us continue to get better, absent the effect of COVID. \n The one thing that is going to go forward is probably in the neighborhood of $70 million or so per quarter on incremental costs associated with safety and cleanliness. And I think that is here to stay for some period of time. \nMarvin Ellison: Scot, I'm going to let Joe McFarland talk a little bit about our productivity initiatives. I mean we're extremely proud of the fact that 18-plus months ago when we did an evaluation of our payroll spend in the stores, roughly 60% of all of our spend was going toward task and noncustomer-facing activity. And Joe has absolutely flipped that equation with the stores. I'm going to let him talk about that for a second. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Scot, we're -- we've been very pleased with the progress we're making on our 60-40 transition. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're well ahead of that schedule. We'll hit the 60% service, 40% task by the end of this year. But that also allows us to continue to make investments in things like our fulfillment teams, the supervisors that we've added to the Pro area of the business and the incremental expense that we incurred there. So we're very pleased with the productivity, and we'll continue on that productivity march. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So as you've gone through this transformation, you mentioned you're ahead of schedule in realizing some of the productivity or cost savings that you expected like the split between task and service, and yet now we're seeing maybe a bit of an acceleration in some of the investments of the business. \n So are you entering a new phase of this transformation, where some of the low-hanging fruit has already been harvested in terms of the cost, and at the same time, investments are increasing, which could occur at a time where this wallet share shift that is benefiting the home improvement category, all of these come together such that we do see a bit of a retrenchment or some margin degradation in your P&L over the next few quarters? \nMarvin Ellison: Michael, this is Marvin. So as Dave mentioned, we're going to have a little bit more specificity on the December 9 investor update. But here's what I will tell you, we don't believe we're going to get entrenched, and we believe that there's still a large amount of opportunity in front of us to drive productivity. \n We have a multiyear time line where we've mapped out initiatives from a merchandising perspective, operational perspective, supply chain, et cetera. We see productivity gains over the next couple of years, if we can. Obviously, those initiatives vary in size and scale, but we believe we still have enormous opportunity. \n And to put it in perspective of your comments, we've made the decision to accelerate this U.S. stores reset initiative because early tests gave us confidence that this would tremendously benefit our Pro customers, and it would create a much more intuitive shopping experience for our DIY customers. And so we took on $100 million of expense in the third quarter, and we're taking on roughly $150 million of expense, and that's going to get roughly 90% of our stores completed. That is an example of us not running this business quarter-to-quarter. \n We want to make sure that we're making the right investments that will have long-term benefits and create long-term productivity gains. And we believe that we're doing that, and that's going to be our focus. And when we update you all in December, we'll provide some perspective on how we see revenue and operational performance as well as profitability in 2021. But we feel really good about our progress, and we feel good about being in a position now to transition to a market share focus ahead of schedule. \nDavid Denton: And Michael, I'll just add that -- Marvin said something very important there, he said we decided to accelerate the program. This was not an incremental program that we didn't have on our road map. This was on our road map consistently over the last  couple of years since we've been here. This is -- now we're taking the opportunity to lean into it. So I think that the original thesis of all the investments that we put forth, I think are very valid. We see a lot of runway to continue to fund those investments and drive performance going forward. \nMichael Lasser: So David, if I could just clarify that and add one unrelated question. Does that mean that some of those pull-forward of investments will come from next year, such that you will get a return on those dollars and you can be in better position to lever your SG&A even in a tougher macro environment? \n And then my follow-up question is the big change in the cadence of the P&L this quarter was the discussion around lower credit revenue and shrink. How long are those going to be issues that weigh on the gross margin? And what has caused those to pop up suddenly? \nDavid Denton: Michael, just as you think about the investments we are making, yes, we're making these investments to improve our productivity in the years to come. So I won't speak specifically to '21. But yes, the things that we're doing today will benefit us going forward. And then secondly, I'll talk a bit about credit revenue and I'll speak -- have Joe McFarland talk about the actions we've taken from a shrink perspective. \n On the credit revenue side of the house, yes, we're having a little bit of pressure there. And there's really 2 things that are happening. One is we are seeing a tender shift as the U.S. consumer has kind of pulled back on debt and your saving rate has increased. So we've seen a tender shift away from our private-level -- private-label credit a little bit into PIN debit. So that puts pressure on that line. \n And then secondly, we are forecasting some higher credit risk going forward just given the macro economy in the future. So a little bit of both of those things are driving that pressure. And then from a strength perspective, I'll let Marvin and Joe comment on that. \nMarvin Ellison: So Michael, I'll hand it to Joe to talk about 2 things, give a little bit of an explanation on shrink, our trends and some of the initiatives to reduce it; but also to give another example of a pull-forward initiative that we are in the midst of executing. So Joe, you can go ahead and cover those 2 things. \nJoseph McFarland: All right. Thanks, Marvin. So as far as the investments, I'll give you a quick example, discussed rolling out of the buy online pickup in store dedicated lockers. And so this was originally on the road map. This was approximately $30 million pull in expense to this year that we had from last year. This will allow us to continue to leverage our payroll expense and continue to drive our omni business. In addition, we have the new dedicated fulfillment team. So we feel very good about the investments we continue to make in the business. \n In regards to shrink, we have been experiencing shrink pressures over the last several quarters. We have a good sense of where that lies. We understand the challenges. We have been making significant investments from a loss prevention standpoint, from a safety standpoint. And so we feel good about the trajectory. \n There were some challenges with being an essential retailer, being some of the only retailers open during the onset of the pandemic. I believe we're cycling some of that today. But again, as we continue to invest in market-level intelligence, in loss prevention and safety programs, we're confident in the payback. \nOperator: Our next question come from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: I'm surprised we've gotten this far into the call without the quarter to -- obligatory quarter-to-date question. I'll phrase it a little bit differently. You talked about seasonal mix being a driver of why you're expecting 15% to 20% comps in the fourth quarter. You did post the 30% in October. Are you just simply mix adjusting for seasonal mix and that drives you into the 15% or 20% -- 15% and 20%? Or are you assuming moderation in other categories? \nMarvin Ellison: So look, I'll take this, Chris, and I'll let either Bill or Dave jump in if they have additional comments. To say this is the most difficult environment to forecast in would be an understatement. What I can tell you is we feel great about our early trends in November. We feel very good about our ability to meet demand if it exceeds our 15% to 20% guidance. We'll have a much better perspective on Q4 when we speak to you and the other investors on December 9. But this is just our way of trying to frame up our best guess of where we think the business is headed in obviously the most difficult and complex forecasting environment that any of us have worked in. \n And again, I'll leave it at that. And if we have more context and more detail on December 9, we'll be more than happy to share. But the key is we feel really good about the trajectory of our business, but this is our best estimate based on what we know today. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then a question on, I guess, the medium- to long-term gross margin outlook. Previously, you had talked about mid- to high-32% range in the existed sort of -- existing sort of algorithm and so forth. Does '21 revert back down to this prior target? And if so, what are the drivers? Because year-to-date, you're performing very nicely in that regard. And so is it supply chain investments that causes some near-term pressures? Is it mix? Some promotional normalization? \n And then longer term, how do you think about the opportunity to get into that 33% to 34% range given your largest peer does have a higher gross margin? Understood there's probably some efficiencies given scale, but at the same time, just trying to think about structurally the differences given all the work that you're doing in the box and around the supply chain. \nDavid Denton: No. We feel very strongly that the opportunity is ahead of us from a gross margin perspective. We're not going to give this back specifically. I will say there is some, I'll say, geographies on the P&L. We continue to push very hard in improving what I would consider our product-level gross margin performance. And part of this is just being very efficient from a promotional standpoint, being very efficient from a cost management perspective. \n At the same time, we are investing in supply chain, and that's going to put pressure on gross margin, but it's going to relieve operating expense within our stores. The flow-through of that is very accretive to op inc. So I think you'll see some geography shifts there, but there's nothing that's going to revert back. It's not our anticipation that we would revert back to where we were prior to this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nSeth Sigman: Nice quarter. I think investors are trying to understand the magnitude and sort of the net impact from the investments you're talking about and the pull-forward. So the question is, and I know it's been asked a couple of different ways today, but if comps are positive and you can sort of manage through next year from a top line perspective, can you continue to expand margin rate in FY '21? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, Seth, we're not commenting in detail on 2021 at that -- at this time. As we've mentioned a couple -- on a couple of different occasions, we're going to be updating you all on December 9, and we're going to have a little bit of perspective. And we're going to spend the majority of that presentation talking about the initiatives and actions we're going to be implementing to improve and take market share. And at that time, we'll have better perspective on '21, and we'll be able to provide a lot more context on what we're doing today. \nDavid Denton: And Seth, I'll just add, let's not get hung up on where we end '20 and where we end '21. The reality here is we set a target of 12% operating income flow-through. I think we're very focused on delivering upon that objective. I think we have very good line of sight to getting to that level and using that as just a stopping point to actually potentially go further after that. So I think our -- the investments that we're making, the focus that we have today is really on improving that flow-through over time. And we still see a very strong line of sight to that. \nMarvin Ellison: And Seth, this is Marvin again. The only other comment I'll make is, we were actually questioned earlier about the MRO space and if we are going to make any strategic changes based on actions in the marketplace. And one of the reasons why we're not is because we see so much upside in our core business. And we see an incredible opportunity to drive efficiency and productivity by continuing to make the right investments in merchandising systems, supply chain, operations. \n And so to Dave's point, we see the 12% not as a pinnacle but as a milestone that we will hit, and then we will continue to drive improved productivity beyond that point. And again, we'll be able to provide more context at our investor update in December. \nDavid Denton: And we're going to take one more question, please. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America. \nElizabeth Lane: Great. I was a little surprised to hear that the product mix was favorable to gross margin, just given that lumber sales growth was so strong and it's usually a lower-margin category. Can you talk about the categories that helped out from a product mix standpoint in the quarter? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Liz, this is Dave. Actually, lumber did put some pressure on gross margin in the quarter as it typically does in an inflationary environment. Having said that, I'd say the merchandising and the finance team have done a really nice job from managing costs kind of across all the categories. And I'd say I can't call out just one category where we're seeing improvements because we're seeing improvements more or less up and down the P&L across all merchandising categories for the most part. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start out by taking a moment to extend my thoughts and prayers to all the individuals and communities impacted by the many wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no doubt that this has been a very challenging year for many of us. \n Although our Lowe's associates are dealing with the same challenges facing the rest of the country, I continue to be inspired by their commitment to serve our customers and communities while juggling a multitude of pressures and obstacles at home. \n Throughout all the uncertainty we face, we continue to be guided by 3 key priorities. First, our highest priority as a company will always be protecting the health and safety of our associates and customers through a safe store environment and shopping experience. And we believe that our strict in-store safety and social distancing protocols implemented in a consistent, uniform manner has built trust with our customers.  \n Our second priority remains providing support for our community, including health care providers and first responders. And our third priority is financially supporting our associates during this challenging time.  \n In support of these priorities, we've invested an incremental $245 million in the third quarter to support our associates. We've now invested more than $1.1 billion in COVID-related support for our associates, store safety initiatives and communities through the first 9 months of this year.  \n Now turning to our results. For the quarter, we delivered total company comparable sales growth of 30.1% over the prior year and 40% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.98. At the same time, we're also making critical investments across our operations to position the company for long-term growth.  \n Our U.S. home improvement comps was 30.4% driven by consistent and strong project demand from both DIY and Pro customers throughout the quarter. In a continuation of trends from Q2, growth was broad-based across channels, product categories and geographies. In fact, growth exceeded 15% across all merchandising departments, 20% across all geographic regions and triple digits on Lowes.com.  \n DIY comps again outpaced Pro comps in the quarter driven by a consumer mindset that remain focused on the redesigning the functionality of their home. Consistent with the redefinition, in the third quarter, customers continued to shop at Lowe's as they took steps to shift their home to serve 3 primary purposes: a home school, a home office and their primary location for recreation and entertainment. We're pleased that customers continue to choose Lowe's as a retail of choice for these very important projects.  \n Our Pro business remained strong in the third quarter with comps exceeding 20%. Our investments to improve our product and service offerings and overall customer experience is resonating with the Pro customers. We're seeing a significant number of new Pro customers rediscover Lowe's, and we're seeing them come back to buy from us over and over again. We're well positioned to continue to attract new Pro customers while also growing share of wallet with existing Pro customers.  \n We launched a significant merchandising investment in the third quarter to reset the footprint of our U.S. stores, shifting to a project-focused versus a product-focused store layout. We believe these changes will create a more intuitive shopping experience for our customers, especially to Pro. And we redesigned the layout of our stores to improve product adjacencies and bay productivity with the goal of increasing sales per square foot. Bill will provide more detail on this very important reset initiative in a moment.  \n From a geographic perspective, we had broad-based growth with positive comparable sales growth exceeding 20% across all 15 geographic regions and all 3 U.S. divisions. Regions that outperformed the total company comps were Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and New York. \n We also continued to see strong sales trends in urban areas. In fact, comp sales in our urban markets outperformed remote or rural markets by over 500 basis points. Our strength in our urban markets reflects the improvements we've made to our product and service offerings for the Pro customer as well as enhanced omnichannel capabilities to serve customers increasingly shopping online.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 106% as we continue to see an increase in both DIY and Pro customer demand for contactless shopping options. We have made tremendous progress over the last 2 years with the right investments to improve our omnichannel retailing capabilities, enabling us to meet the ever-increasing expectations of customers to shop whatever way they choose.  \n And we continue to invest in our supply chain network as we opened new cross-dock delivery terminals, bulk distribution centers and e-commerce fulfillment centers to expand our fulfillment capabilities.  \n And while we've seen exponential online growth this year, we still have tremendous growth runway in front of us as Lowes.com business is meaningfully underpenetrated, with online representing only 7% of our sales. Supported by our modern cloud-based platform, our talented dot-com and technology team has a detailed road map towards becoming a best-in-class omnichannel retailer.  \n Turning to Canada. We posted positive comps that exceeded 25%, supported by strong Pro and DIY demand as well as early success implementing our retail fundamentals playbook to improve operating efficiency while driving sales. This was a very important quarter for us as we drove strong top line results while continuing to make significant investments across merchandising, Lowes.com, store operations and supply chain that will enable us to capitalize on current trends and will position us as a company to drive sustainable growth.  \n 2020 has demonstrated to all of us how quickly shopping behaviors can change. And I'm proud of the agility that we've shown to adjust our business model to serve an unprecedented number of customers in store and on Lowes.com. We also understand that agility will be important as we hopefully pivot to a post-COVID retail environment later in 2021. \n However, we understand that creating an efficient and world-class omnichannel experience will determine retail winners and retail losers in the future. Therefore, we're pleased with the current development of our omnichannel strategy thus far and remain committed to making the necessary investments to provide our customers with choices to shop any way they choose. And over the near term, our investment thesis will remain laser-focused on enhancing the growth and profitability of our core retail business.  \n Before I close, I'd like to again express my sincere appreciation for the tremendous efforts of our associates to support our customers and communities when they need us most. The country continues to face significant challenges presented by COVID-19, and this is still a very unpredictable business environment. However, our #1 priority as an essential business will always be supporting the health and safety of our associates and our customers.  \n I look forward to speaking with you again at our investor update on December 9 with a discussion focused on the market share growth opportunities that lie ahead of us.  \n With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill. Simeon, this is a very good question. We actually feel great about the transformation. I mean, obviously, we don't have perfect visibility to the future and we had no idea, as no one did, that we'd be dealing with a global pandemic in the year 2020. But when I think about how far we've progressed in 2 years, when you look at the digital platform and our online business, the last 2 quarters growing 135%; last quarter, 106%. In the third quarter, we were at levels that we could not have even imagined just 12 to 16 months ago, merchandising initiatives, supply chain. \n I think the key for us is that we're not really concerned about the short term. We know this is a great brand, we have a strong balance sheet and we're trying to make the right investments in the future. When I look around at the accomplishments of the team, I'm exceptionally proud because we're a little bit ahead of schedule, as Dave mentioned. And we think that we're going to start to lean into taking market share. \n And at the December 9 investor update, we're going to be a lot more specific about kind of where we are in this transformation and how we see the out-years and where we believe that we can really start to pick up additional market share. But overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the progress of this team. Well, I'll take the first part and see if Dave has any additional context. Dave mentioned that we're committed to fundamental expenses relative to cleaning and providing a safe environment for our associates and customers in our physical stores. And so that is something that we are committed to continuing to execute. \n We're going to just monitor all other aspects of the needs of our associates and determine what, if any, additional investments need to be made in the fourth quarter. We've actually followed that philosophy for the last couple of quarters, and the fourth quarter won't be any different.  \n I don't know if Dave has anything to add. Kate, it's really difficult for us to give you a very specific forecast on that. Obviously, this is the most difficult environment for any kind of a financial forecast. But I think at a high level, we anticipate that you're going to see that gap continue to close and the Pros will start to gain more of a penetration as we start to have less of the nesting effect when we get to this post-COVID environment. \n One of the reasons we're making all of these investments in the Pro, and as Joe and I both mentioned, I mean we grew the business over 20% in the third quarter, is because we're anticipating this post-COVID retail environment and we know this customer is very important for us. So we expect that gap to continue to close as we get into 2021. The question is when and that's going to be, in large part, based on COVID and how the nesting effect of the DIY starts to minimize over time. Kate, it does not. I made the comment earlier in my prepared comments that we're committed to the core retail business. When we look at our investment thesis and we evaluate where we can gain the greatest return, it is in our core business. \n Now we're going to continue to target the MRO segment in our current Pro strategy with our outside sales reps, but those reps are connected to the store and connected to our MSH model. And we feel like that, that model has the ability to scale. But our investment thesis, our focus, is improving our core business. And our core business is defined as our brick-and-mortar stores, our dot-com platform, our supply chain and all the other operational components that tie that together. And that's our omnichannel philosophy. \n We feel like we're in a good position, and we're going to continue to make those investments. And over time, that thesis may change. But in the short term and near term, we're just laser-focused on our core business. Scot, I'm going to let Joe McFarland talk a little bit about our productivity initiatives. I mean we're extremely proud of the fact that 18-plus months ago when we did an evaluation of our payroll spend in the stores, roughly 60% of all of our spend was going toward task and noncustomer-facing activity. And Joe has absolutely flipped that equation with the stores. I'm going to let him talk about that for a second. Michael, this is Marvin. So as Dave mentioned, we're going to have a little bit more specificity on the December 9 investor update. But here's what I will tell you, we don't believe we're going to get entrenched, and we believe that there's still a large amount of opportunity in front of us to drive productivity. \n We have a multiyear time line where we've mapped out initiatives from a merchandising perspective, operational perspective, supply chain, et cetera. We see productivity gains over the next couple of years, if we can. Obviously, those initiatives vary in size and scale, but we believe we still have enormous opportunity. \n And to put it in perspective of your comments, we've made the decision to accelerate this U.S. stores reset initiative because early tests gave us confidence that this would tremendously benefit our Pro customers, and it would create a much more intuitive shopping experience for our DIY customers. And so we took on $100 million of expense in the third quarter, and we're taking on roughly $150 million of expense, and that's going to get roughly 90% of our stores completed. That is an example of us not running this business quarter-to-quarter. \n We want to make sure that we're making the right investments that will have long-term benefits and create long-term productivity gains. And we believe that we're doing that, and that's going to be our focus. And when we update you all in December, we'll provide some perspective on how we see revenue and operational performance as well as profitability in 2021. But we feel really good about our progress, and we feel good about being in a position now to transition to a market share focus ahead of schedule. So Michael, I'll hand it to Joe to talk about 2 things, give a little bit of an explanation on shrink, our trends and some of the initiatives to reduce it; but also to give another example of a pull-forward initiative that we are in the midst of executing. So Joe, you can go ahead and cover those 2 things. So look, I'll take this, Chris, and I'll let either Bill or Dave jump in if they have additional comments. To say this is the most difficult environment to forecast in would be an understatement. What I can tell you is we feel great about our early trends in November. We feel very good about our ability to meet demand if it exceeds our 15% to 20% guidance. We'll have a much better perspective on Q4 when we speak to you and the other investors on December 9. But this is just our way of trying to frame up our best guess of where we think the business is headed in obviously the most difficult and complex forecasting environment that any of us have worked in. \n And again, I'll leave it at that. And if we have more context and more detail on December 9, we'll be more than happy to share. But the key is we feel really good about the trajectory of our business, but this is our best estimate based on what we know today. Well, Seth, we're not commenting in detail on 2021 at that -- at this time. As we've mentioned a couple -- on a couple of different occasions, we're going to be updating you all on December 9, and we're going to have a little bit of perspective. And we're going to spend the majority of that presentation talking about the initiatives and actions we're going to be implementing to improve and take market share. And at that time, we'll have better perspective on '21, and we'll be able to provide a lot more context on what we're doing today. And Seth, this is Marvin again. The only other comment I'll make is, we were actually questioned earlier about the MRO space and if we are going to make any strategic changes based on actions in the marketplace.

And we see an incredible opportunity to drive efficiency and productivity by continuing to make the right investments in merchandising systems, supply chain, operations. \n And so to Dave's point, we see the 12% not as a pinnacle but as a milestone that we will hit, and then we will continue to drive improved productivity beyond that point. And again, we'll be able to provide more context at our investor update in December."

            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin this morning outlining the company's strong capital allocation program. In the first 9 months of 2020, we generated $10.3 billion in free cash flow driven by very strong operating performance. In the third quarter alone, we paid $416 million in dividends. We also announced a dividend of $0.60 per share, a 9% increase that will be paid in the fourth quarter of this year.  \n During the quarter, we reinstated our share repurchase program and repurchased 3.6 million shares in the open market for $621 million. I continue to expect our share repurchase program to be a significant contributor to long-term shareholder value creation. We incurred capital expenditures of $462 million as we invest in the business to support our strategic initiatives, including our omnichannel capabilities.  \n In October, we took advantage of a favorable interest rate environment to reduce our interest expense through a cash tender offer for $3 billion of our higher coupon bonds. As a result, we recognized a loss of $1.1 billion on the extinguishment of debt.  \n To fund the tender offer, we issued $4 billion of unsecured notes. This issuance consisted of 7-, 10- and 30-year notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.17%, which is a record low in the company's history. These efforts further strengthen our capital position by lowering our interest expense over the longer term. \n We now have $8.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. And combined with $3 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities, we have immediate access to $11.2 billion in funds, which we are confident is more than enough liquidity to navigate any uncertainty. At the end of Q3, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.3x.  \n Now turning to the income statement. In Q3, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91 compared to $1.36 last year, a decrease of 33%. And as I just mentioned, the company incurred a $1.1 billion loss on debt extinguishment this quarter.  \n Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons, where applicable. In Q3, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.98 per share, an increase of 40% compared to the prior year. These results were driven by higher-than-expected sales volume as well as our strong execution to meet elevated customer demands. \n Q3 sales were $22.3 billion, an increase of 30.1% on a comparable basis versus the prior year. This is driven by transaction growth of 16.4% and comparable sales average ticket growth of 13.7%. We continue to see strong repeat rates from both new and existing customers. \n Commodity inflation drove a benefit of approximately 340 basis points to comps in the quarter. U.S. comp sales were up 30.4% in the quarter, with continued strength from both DIY and Pro customers and broad-based demand across geographies, merchandising departments and selling channels. Our U.S. monthly comps were consistently strong throughout the quarter with 28.9% in August, 31.8% in September and 30% in October despite a significant reduction in promotional activity versus LY.  \n Gross margin was 32.7% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 28 basis points compared to the third quarter of '19. Product gross margin rate improved 65 basis points driven by continued improvements from our pricing, cost management and promotional strategies. Favorable product mix drove approximately 35 basis points of benefit. These benefits were offset by 30 basis points of headwind from lower credit revenue, 25 basis points of pressure from inventory shrink and 20 basis points of pressure from supply chain cost.  \n And consistent with our long-term strategy, we are investing in our supply chain as we expand our network to stand up market-level delivery model for big and bulky products. We further expanded capacity for parcel shipments with the opening of a new direct fulfillment center on the West Coast.  \n SG&A was 21.4% of sales in Q3, a 31 basis point improvement compared to LY. As we anticipated, we incurred $290 million of COVID-related expenses. These investments included $230 million in financial assistance for our frontline associates and approximately $55 million related to both cleaning and other safety-related programs, and approximately $5 million in charitable contributions. \n These $290 million of COVID-related expenses negatively impacted SG&A leverage by 130 basis points. We also incurred approximately $100 million in a large-scale strategic merchandising reset of our U.S. stores, which negatively impacted SG&A leverage by 45 basis points.  \n These incremental costs were partially offset by payroll leverage of 90 basis points related to higher sales volume and improved store operating efficiencies, occupancy leverage of 35 basis points, 35 basis points of leverage in employee benefits and advertising leverage of 25 basis points. Adjusted operating income margin increased 55 basis points to 9.81% of sales. The adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% was in line with the prior year.  \n Now Q3 benefited from a $0.02 timing shift into Q3 at the expense of Q4. At $15.7 billion, inventory was higher compared to the prior year levels as we stocked up on product to meet elevated customer demand throughout the quarter. Also, lumber inflation increased inventory values by approximately $250 million.  \n I'd now like to spend just a few minutes discussing our outlook for the fourth quarter. While the operating environment remains uncertain and we still have limited visibility into the longer-term trends, I'd like to share my perspectives about how we are planning the business in Q4. We expect that our top line growth will moderate from Q3 levels as outperformance in seasonal categories abates in the fourth quarter. This is consistent with natural demand patterns of the home improvement sector.  \n For the quarter, we expect total and comparable sales growth of between 15% and 20%. Consistent with the prior 2 quarters, we anticipate that we will incur ongoing COVID-related operating expenses of approximately $75 million to support safety and cleanliness in our stores. In Q4, we will continue to evaluate the operating environment and assess any potential incremental associate financial assistance. \n We expect to incur approximately $150 million in expenses associated with the merchandising investment in our stores as we expect to complete the reset activity for over 90% of our U.S. stores by the end of the fourth quarter.  \n Additionally, we will continue to invest in expanding our supply chain network. These significant investments, coupled with our fourth quarter typically being our smallest revenue quarter, should result in adjusted operating margin performance essentially flat to prior year levels. The effective tax rate is expected to be over 27%.  \n Continuing our commitment to return capital to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases, our guidance assumes approximately $3 billion in share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We expect GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.20 a share. For adjusted EPS, this represents 22% growth at the midpoint over the prior year. We are now planning for approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures for the year with a continued focus on our omnichannel investments.  \n In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our outstanding results for the first 9 months of the year. In an unprecedented operating environment, we remain focused on serving our customers and our communities, which led to an opportunity to grow market share earlier than we expected.  \n I remain confident that we are making the right investments to drive sustainable growth. We have a strong balance sheet and we are committed to a disciplined capital allocation program, which will lead to a longer-term shareholder value creation. I look forward to speaking with you again soon at our investor update meeting on December 9. \n So with that, I thank you. We are now ready for questions. Yes. Simeon, this is Dave. The only thing I would add to that is that, obviously, in November, the associates will receive incremental compensation. And then in December, our \"Winning Together\" program kicks into play. And just given how the stores are performing, the vast majority if not almost all the stores are at max payout from that. So we're leaning into areas to compensate our associates tied to their needs but also tied to performance. And Kate, this is Dave. I'd just add that if we step back and think about the financial algorithm of this company over the next several years, as we've said many times, we real strength in the DIY customer. You're seeing that in our numbers today. The opportunity over time is to really penetrate and grow our Pro business. And I think the investments we're making both in Q3 and Q4, and really as we cycle into next year, is really bolstering our business model around the Pro. \n And so it's not going to be like a light switch that we're going to just turn on and the Pro is going to just elevate significantly, but this is each week and each month and each quarter kind of continue to push and grind ourselves out to grow that Pro business. And that's the objective we have here. Yes. It's probably a little early to talk specifically about '21. But just in general, I think what you're seeing is we have a very focused effort around store productivity and managing both labor and costs within our stores. Couple that with the investments that we're making in supply chain, which is ultimately creating a market-based delivery model, that will ultimately put pressure a little bit on gross margin as we take delivery out of the stores, move it into the market, but relieve the stores of that burden from an SG&A perspective. So you'll see incremental flow-through as that model gets built out. \n That's probably a 12-, 18-, 24-month process before that happens. But I think we're well on our way to continue to make investments, both from a technology perspective and an operational improvement perspective to drive productivity. So you should see us continue to get better, absent the effect of COVID. \n The one thing that is going to go forward is probably in the neighborhood of $70 million or so per quarter on incremental costs associated with safety and cleanliness. And I think that is here to stay for some period of time. And Michael, I'll just add that -- Marvin said something very important there, he said we decided to accelerate the program. This was not an incremental program that we didn't have on our road map. This was on our road map consistently over the last  couple of years since we've been here. This is -- now we're taking the opportunity to lean into it. So I think that the original thesis of all the investments that we put forth, I think are very valid. We see a lot of runway to continue to fund those investments and drive performance going forward. Michael, just as you think about the investments we are making, yes, we're making these investments to improve our productivity in the years to come. So I won't speak specifically to '21. But yes, the things that we're doing today will benefit us going forward. And then secondly, I'll talk a bit about credit revenue and I'll speak -- have Joe McFarland talk about the actions we've taken from a shrink perspective. \n On the credit revenue side of the house, yes, we're having a little bit of pressure there. And there's really 2 things that are happening. One is we are seeing a tender shift as the U.S. consumer has kind of pulled back on debt and your saving rate has increased. So we've seen a tender shift away from our private-level -- private-label credit a little bit into PIN debit. So that puts pressure on that line. \n And then secondly, we are forecasting some higher credit risk going forward just given the macro economy in the future. So a little bit of both of those things are driving that pressure. And then from a strength perspective, I'll let Marvin and Joe comment on that. No. We feel very strongly that the opportunity is ahead of us from a gross margin perspective. We're not going to give this back specifically. I will say there is some, I'll say, geographies on the P&L. We continue to push very hard in improving what I would consider our product-level gross margin performance. And part of this is just being very efficient from a promotional standpoint, being very efficient from a cost management perspective. \n At the same time, we are investing in supply chain, and that's going to put pressure on gross margin, but it's going to relieve operating expense within our stores. The flow-through of that is very accretive to op inc. So I think you'll see some geography shifts there, but there's nothing that's going to revert back. It's not our anticipation that we would revert back to where we were prior to this year. And Seth, I'll just add, let's not get hung up on where we end '20 and where we end '21. The reality here is we set a target of 12% operating income flow-through. I think we're very focused on delivering upon that objective. I think we have very good line of sight to getting to that level and using that as just a stopping point to actually potentially go further after that. So I think our -- the investments that we're making, the focus that we have today is really on improving that flow-through over time. And we still see a very strong line of sight to that. And we're going to take one more question, please. Yes. Liz, this is Dave. Actually, lumber did put some pressure on gross margin in the quarter as it typically does in an inflationary environment. Having said that, I'd say the merchandising and the finance team have done a really nice job from managing costs kind of across all the categories. And I'd say I can't call out just one category where we're seeing improvements because we're seeing improvements more or less up and down the P&L across all merchandising categories for the most part."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. As Marvin mentioned, we posted U.S. home improvement comparable sales growth of 30.4% in the third quarter. Our continued strong execution, combined with elevated brand and product offerings, enabled us to effectively serve the sustained increase in customer demand driven by the increased importance that customers are placing on their homes.  \n Similar to the second quarter, growth was broad-based across both DIY and Pro customers, in-store and online, and across all merchandising departments. In fact, all 15 merchandising departments generated positive comps exceeded 15%. Lumber led the way, again driven by strong unit demand across Pro and DIY customers, supported by our continued investments in job lot quantities, and the strength of our merchants and our supply chain teams in sourcing these high-demand products.  \n In addition to lumber, we delivered above-average comps in decor, lawn and garden, and seasonal and outdoor living. Within decor, our growth was driven largely by the strength in furniture, including accent furniture and accessories, along with the strong results in home organization, as customers continue to update and create new spaces for home offices and remote schooling.  \n In lawn and garden, there was broad-based strength across the business, though most notably within live goods and landscape products, as customers actively engaged in outdoor landscaping and other fall exterior projects. Our seasonal and outdoor living team also delivered comps above the company average this quarter driven by customers looking to extend their outdoor entertaining space, with fire pits and patio heaters being the accelerated product category for this fall.\n We continue to strengthen our position as the #1 destination for outdoor power equipment with the recent addition of EGO, which is the top-selling brand in battery-powered outdoor power equipment, to our all-star lineup, which includes John Deere, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Honda and the Ariens brands. And we continue to leverage our other powerhouse brands like Weber and Char-Broil, which continues to be the top 2 brands in outdoor grilling.  \n Now turning to our online results. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered sales growth of 106% on Lowes.com. With the replatforming of Lowes.com to the cloud, we have been rapidly deploying enhancements to deliver a better customer experience, including enhanced online delivery scheduling, so that customers can more efficiently self-serve and select the delivery time that is most convenient for them or easily reschedule as the need arises.  \n We also made it easier to shop by product collection with over 500 collections and growing. So customers can now purchase a patio set without it involving a time-consuming search for each individual item.\n I'm also excited that we now have the capability to ship products that require special handling, items like lithium-ion batteries. This capability now enables us to handle online orders of EGO, Kobalt and Skill battery-powered products, along with other products powered by lithium batteries or items that may require care in shipping and handling.  \n And as Marvin covered in his opening remarks, we are resetting the footprint of the store, so that's more intuitive shopping experience for our customers, especially for the Pro. For example, the reflow of our rough plumbing and electrical aisles are 2 key areas for the Pro that needed to reflect how the Pro shops. We are now placing all of the relevant products adjacent to each other, such as pipe cement next to pipe and the necessary fittings next to their respective pipe category.\n We are also eliminating merchandising bays without planograms. We call these junk bays, thus opening up space for higher-velocity, higher-demand items and categories that will better reflect the local market. We are on track to have the reset complete for over 90% of our stores by fiscal year-end.  \n And as part of this store reset, there'll be 2 other noticeable changes. First, we are adding a Pro-Flex area, similar to what we did earlier this year in our seasonal areas, making it easier for the Pro to grab and go. And then second, we are moving the cleaning category to the main or the first aisle of our stores. This is just another example of ways we are working to improve the productivity in this highly visible area of the store.  \n And as we look to close out the year, we are building on our momentum around the holiday season that began with our first-ever drive-through, curbside trick-or-treating event at our stores, where we gave away candy and pumpkins to hundreds of thousands of families who are excited about the holidays but may not have had the same door-to-door trick or treating available in their neighborhoods as in years past. \n And we feel that this will be a holiday season like no other, when our customers will no doubt be spending much more time at home. And because of that, we're helping our customers invest in the time and memories that they're creating at home. And we're planning to deliver a season of savings for the holidays over an extended period to avoid creating congestion in our stores.  \n Consistent with our approach throughout 2020, we continue to expect reduced promotional activity compared to the prior year. Overall, we've delivered outstanding results this year, and I can't say enough about the unbelievable efforts of our vendor partners and our merchants who have worked extremely hard to keep up with the unprecedented demand.  \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. This year, we faced operational challenges unlike anything I've encountered in my career, whether it's in response to a hurricane, flood, tornado or global health crisis, Lowe's associates take pride in the role they play to keep families safe in their homes and businesses running in challenging times. Our associates have also remained steadfast in their commitment to providing a safe shopping experience in our stores so our customers feel comfortable returning for another shopping trip to Lowe's.  \n In recognition of the outstanding efforts of our team, we have provided financial support to our hourly associates with 2 additional $100 million bonuses this quarter. Full-time associates received $300 and part-time associates received $150 in each payment, while Lowe's covered the cost of the tax gross-up again. This brings our total COVID-related financial assistance to our associates to over $800 million this year.  \n And I'm thrilled to announce that for the third quarter in a row, 100% of our stores have earned their \"Winning Together\" profit-sharing bonus totaling $104 million. Once again, their efforts exceeded expectations, so this represents an incremental $31 million over the target payment level.  \n I was also really pleased to see the strong frontline associate morale, reflected in their impressive level of engagement in our recent annual associate survey. Our associates indicated that they feel supported by the company during this challenging year and that they are energized by their work. \n And we're supporting our communities through hiring as we're bringing on 20,000 associates across our U.S. stores and distribution centers this holiday season to support elevated levels of customer demand. This year, we've hired over 155,000 associates through our seasonal hiring programs, and many of these seasonal hires have transitioned to a more permanent role within the company.  \n The pandemic has changed the way we all live, work and shop. This is evident in our increased customer demand for contactless shopping options this year. This quarter, we began adding touchless BOPIS lockers to our stores to complement our curbside pickup and BOPIS pickup at checkout. We're focused on rolling out these lockers to our major metro markets by Thanksgiving. And we are standing up dedicated fulfillment teams at our stores who are already improving speed of service and customer satisfaction with their consistent focus on this important function.  \n We're also raising our game with the Pro as we expand our brand and product offerings to meet their unique needs. We are adding to our Eaton electrical product assortment, which is a go-to solution for the Pro working on a home remodeling project. And we are now the largest distribution partner for SharkBite, which provides push-to-connect plumbing products that make projects fast and easy, a must-have for any plumbing project.  \n Combined with the power of Simpson Strong-Tie, DEWALT, Spyder and Bosch brands, this broader offering in Eaton and SharkBite builds out our arsenal to ensure that we have a competitive offering that meets the needs of our Pros across the variety of projects that they handle.  \n And we kicked off a multiyear national rollout of our tool rental program to increase our relevance with the Pro, as over 70% of Pros rent tools at least once a year. In August, we celebrated the grand opening of our first tool rental location in Charlotte, where we provide high-quality tools for both Pros, DIYs and weekend warriors through a convenient online platform that allows customers to reserve their tools ahead of time. We are encouraged by the early results and the strong feedback from our most frequent Pro customers in the Charlotte area.  \n Looking at our third quarter results. I'm really pleased with the comps exceeding 20% that the Pro team delivered. We are consistently meeting the needs of our Pro customers with job lot quantities that are available every week, efficient service focused on getting them back on the job site quickly and the products they're looking for. We're winning new Pro customers, and they're coming back to our stores again and again.  \n And we continue to drive efficiency by streamlining our store operations as we leverage technology to improve customer service and alleviate the task and responsibilities for our Red Vest associates. \n This quarter, we leveraged the new intuitive touchscreen POS at our registers to easily cross-train other associates on the cashier position. These new touchscreen registers not only speed up cashier training from the old green screens, they also provide our customers with a faster checkout experience. This is consistent with our store simplification approach, which leverages new technology to make our associates more productive while also improving customer service at the same time.  \n With all these store technology processes and improvements under our belt, we are well on our way to hit our target of 60% service and 40% tasking by the end of the year. And it's paying off with high customer satisfaction scores as we acquire new customers who keep coming back to shop at Lowe's.  \n Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Dave. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Scot, we're -- we've been very pleased with the progress we're making on our 60-40 transition. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're well ahead of that schedule. We'll hit the 60% service, 40% task by the end of this year. But that also allows us to continue to make investments in things like our fulfillment teams, the supervisors that we've added to the Pro area of the business and the incremental expense that we incurred there. So we're very pleased with the productivity, and we'll continue on that productivity march. All right. Thanks, Marvin. So as far as the investments, I'll give you a quick example, discussed rolling out of the buy online pickup in store dedicated lockers. And so this was originally on the road map. This was approximately $30 million pull in expense to this year that we had from last year. This will allow us to continue to leverage our payroll expense and continue to drive our omni business. In addition, we have the new dedicated fulfillment team. So we feel very good about the investments we continue to make in the business. \n In regards to shrink, we have been experiencing shrink pressures over the last several quarters. We have a good sense of where that lies. We understand the challenges. We have been making significant investments from a loss prevention standpoint, from a safety standpoint. And so we feel good about the trajectory. \n There were some challenges with being an essential retailer, being some of the only retailers open during the onset of the pandemic. I believe we're cycling some of that today. But again, as we continue to invest in market-level intelligence, in loss prevention and safety programs, we're confident in the payback."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe's Companies Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  \n I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Here with me today are: Marvin Ellison, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Dave Denton, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2020. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. \n Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in this morning's press release and on our Investor Relations website.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start out by thanking our associates for their tremendous actions to support our customers and communities across both the U.S. and Canada. We are grateful for their hard work and ongoing commitment to safety. Without question, this has been the most challenging personal and business environment that any of us have operated in. Throughout all the uncertainty that we faced in the second quarter, we never lost focus that our #1 priority as a company is protecting the health and well-being of our associates and customers through a safe store environment and shopping experience.  \n In the second quarter, we continued to prioritize the financial support of our associates and community while providing the customers with the products and services they need to manage and care for their homes. We were pleased and humbled that we were the first choice for many customers who needed home improvement items for their businesses and homes during this unprecedented time. And I would like to thank those customers who trusted us and for rediscovering Lowe's.  \n More specifically, during the second quarter, we invested an incremental $460 million in support for our frontline associates, communities and store safety. Through the first half of 2020, the company has invested $560 million in incremental financial support for our associates. In recognizing that helping people make their homes better extends into our neighborhoods, communities and country, we've committed $55 million in grants to support minority-owned and rural small businesses. In total, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we've committed $100 million of assistance to those in our community who need it most.  \n Our financial results this quarter demonstrate that we've experienced unprecedented demand in many of our business categories due to customers spending more time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these results could not have been realized without our efforts over the past 18 months to implement our retail fundamental strategy, which dramatically improved and modernized our business infrastructure. These modernization efforts have created technology and operational platforms to meet customer demand and grow our business during these challenging times. And some of these initiatives include hiring home improvement and retail subject matter experts in key leadership roles, which has allowed us to quickly make informed decisions and implement necessary changes during the COVID-19 crisis; replatforming Lowes.com from a decade-old infrastructure to the cloud and developing a top-rated mobile app that's allowed us to grow online sales triple digits; a customer-centric labor scheduling system that gave stores the flexibility to align payroll with the unique needs of the customer and the associate; deploying a new price management system to provide our merchants with better data to maintain cost discipline and take more strategic approach to pricing and promotions; enhanced Pro product and service offerings, combined with the new Pro loyalty platform, that helps us keep pros working and offers them meaningful rewards while providing us with better customer insights; and our field merchants and merchandise service teams who play an essential role in helping our stores quickly reconfigure to support social distancing and also respond to the significant increase in demand. While we still have work to do, we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far to modernize our company. And we're looking forward to building on this momentum in the back half of 2020 and for years to come.  \n Now let me turn to our second quarter results. We delivered strong sales growth beyond our expectations with total company comp sales growing 34.2% over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share grew 75% to $3.74. Our U.S. home improvement comps was 35.1% due to robust project demand from DIY and Pro customers that was broad-based across channels, product categories and geographies. Overall, we saw a sharp acceleration from Q1 demand trends, including significant increases in the number of new Pro and DIY and millennial customers.  \n DIY comps outpaced Pro comps in the quarter, driven by a consumer mindset that was heavily focused on the home and wallet share shifts away from other activities, like dining out, vacations and purchasing apparel. Pro sales were also strong with comps in the mid-20s with demand accelerating in May and remaining strong throughout the quarter. Our Pro performance was supported by the progress we've made with retail fundamentals, like job lot quantities and improved service levels.  \n From a geographic perspective, growth was balanced across the U.S. store footprint with positive comps of 30% or more in all 15 geographic regions in all 3 U.S. divisions. Importantly, we saw strong sales trends in urban areas. In fact, comp sales in our urban markets outperformed remote or rural markets by over 500 basis points. This is an important data point because it reflects the success of our business model in all geographic settings as well as the importance of having a strong Pro business as well as an effective omnichannel strategy to compete in urban settings.  \n Our Lowes.com comp sales grew 135% as Pro and DIY customers increasingly shopped online, driving online penetration to 8% of sales. And as I mentioned earlier, we completed the replatform of Lowes.com to the cloud during the quarter. This enabled us to improve site functionality and sustain triple-digit growth without any systems interruptions. I'm very pleased with the work of our CIO, Seemantini Godbole, and her team to complete this replatforming effort in record time.  \n And in Canada, we posted positive comps that exceeded 20%, driven by similar consumer focus on the home as well as strong execution by our new leadership team. While we're pleased with their efforts to serve the incremental demand this quarter, our Canadian team remains focused on the work ahead to improve operating efficiency while driving sales.  \n Looking ahead, we are confident that we'll continue to build on the momentum that we delivered in the first half. And in the second half of this year, we are reinvesting in the business to elevate our product, simplify our store environment and improve our service offering. These investments will include store resets to improve product adjacencies, bay productivity and sales per square feet.  \n We're also advancing our supply chain infrastructure with our recent announcement that we'll open 50 cross-dock delivery terminals, 7 bulk distribution centers and 4 e-commerce fulfillment centers over the next 18 months. Our investments in our stores and investments in our supply chain evolution reinforces our commitment to becoming a world-class omnichannel retailer. We're making the right investments to drive long-term sales growth, operating profitability and sustainable shareholder returns.  \n In closing, I'd like to reiterate how incredibly proud I am of our associates and their dedication to supporting customers in our communities during this time when they need us most. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. Over the past 18 months, we've been steadily improving our store operating efficiency and customer service. And we remained laser-focused on supporting a safe store environment through a data-driven approach based on an analysis of store traffic trends across our portfolio.  \n As I previously indicated, we implemented numerous safety standards in the first quarter in support of social distancing and enhanced sanitizing and cleaning. We executed these standards in a consistent, uniform manner across our stores in the U.S. and Canada to protect the health and safety of our team members and the communities we serve. These standards included removing product to free up space for our customer, adding signage and floor markings and adding social distancing ambassadors and leveraging technology to monitor store traffic, which help store managers limit customers based on the footprint, in line with the regulatory requirements.  \n In the second quarter, we added further safety measures by requiring all frontline associates to wear masks beginning in early May and by adopting a nationwide standard for all customers to wear masks in mid-July. In support of this standard, we are providing free masks for customers who need them. And our customers' appreciation for these efforts was evident in a significant increase in our brand reputation and engagement scores as we shifted our marketing away from promotional messaging and instead focused on our commitment to our communities.  \n I'm also pleased that we delivered strong customer service for both Pro and DIY customers in the second quarter while maintaining rigorous safety requirements and driving 35% U.S. sales comps. This is a testament to the outstanding work of our frontline associates and our commitment to our customers and communities. The health and safety of our associates and customers has always been and will remain our highest priority. \n Our strong results this quarter would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of our frontline associates, and we continue to recognize these efforts with incremental financial assistance. We announced 2 bonuses for July and August, which totaled $230 million. Full-time associates are receiving $300 and part-time and seasonal associates are receiving $150 in each payout. In fact, each payout was grossed up for taxes, so the company covered the incremental taxes as well. Combined with the support provided earlier in the year, we have now invested $560 million in COVID-related financial support for our frontline associates.  \n And in addition, I'm really pleased to announce that 100% of our stores earned a record \"Winning Together\" profit-sharing bonus this quarter totaling $107 million. Based on better-than-expected store performance, this represents an incremental $35 million payout to our frontline associates, above the target payment level. And we supported our communities by hiring over 100,000 associates for the spring. We are converting these seasonal associates to permanent positions at a much higher rate than in past years, which will help us meet the strong demand that we're continuing to see across our stores. In addition, each of these associates received telemedicine benefits for themselves and their families, even if they were not enrolled in Lowe's benefits program.  \n I'd like to now spend a few moments discussing our initiatives in support of our Pro customer. When the pandemic hit, we recognized that we needed to step up our efforts to keep pros working. On June 1, we launched JobSIGHT for Pros in partnership with Streem. This is a free, augmented video chat service that allows pros to conduct virtual home visits with their clients without entering their homes, which opens up their job opportunities. This is just another example of how we're innovating to leapfrog our competition.  \n And to further support their job pipeline, we recently announced a partnership with HomeAdvisor for our Pro loyalty customers. These customers will receive a free 1-year subscription to HomeAdvisor and a credit for an average of 10 free job leads as well as access to webinars hosted by industry experts on how to grow their business. Our Pro customers know that we've got their back and are committed to help keep them working, particularly in these uncertain times.  \n And today, we are thrilled to announce a significant step in the expansion of our product and service offering for the Pro. We are beginning a multiyear national rollout of Lowe's tool rental program with the grand opening of our first location at our Central Charlotte store next week. As over 70% of pros are currently utilizing tool rental programs, this will provide a meaningful opportunity for Lowe's to deepen our relationship with this customer segment. After a successful pilot, we are launching this program nationwide with a broad product assortment, a fully equipped mechanic shop, a large store footprint and importantly, intuitive customer-facing technology that creates a fast, frictionless process for this time-pressed customer. I look forward to updating you on our progress against this important initiative on future calls.\n Turning to our services business. Installed sales delivered positive comps in Q2 with the results improving as we moved through the quarter as customers began to feel more comfortable allowing contractors back in their homes. And from a store technology perspective, we've also completed the rollout of our intuitive touchscreen point-of-sale system and checkout across all stores. This new interface dramatically reduces associate training time as compared to the cumbersome green screens and multiple interfaces that they were previously using and also improves the customer experience through a shorter checkout process.  \n We also completed the launch of mobile printing across our store portfolio and installed digital signs in our appliance department. These initiatives reflect our ongoing efforts to modernize our store environment while giving our store associates more time in the aisles to serve our customers and move us further towards our goal of allocating 60% of their time to customer service and 40% to completing tasks.  \n In closing, I'd like to reiterate my appreciation for our frontline associates and their continued hard work and commitment to safety in serving customers. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Marvin mentioned, we posted U.S. home improvement comparable sales growth of 35.1% in the second quarter, driven by broad-based outperformance across DIY and Pro customers as well as indoor and outdoor product categories. We delivered indoor comps of 30%, driven by strength in indoor categories, such as decor and lighting. We delivered strong growth across all merchandising departments. In fact, all 15 merchandising departments generated positive comps exceeding 20%.\n As customers continue to spend more time at home this quarter, we saw an acceleration in both indoor and outdoor project activity, including core repair and maintenance, along with projects to repurpose home space for work and study as well as discretionary indoor and outdoor projects to increase customers' enjoyment of their homes. We also continued to see robust COVID-related demand for essential cleaning products along with other home necessities such as appliances.  \n During the quarter, we posted comps over 30% in core project categories, such as lumber, tools and paint, driven largely by extensive indoor and outdoor project activity from both the DIY and Pro customer. Importantly, we saw significant improvement in installation-heavy categories, such as flooring, millwork and kitchen and bath. In paint, we continued to drive strong sales of both interior and exterior paint and stains as well as applicators as our brand offering and service model positioned us to serve increased project demand with our paint products being key components of many home improvement projects.  \n Lumber benefited from strong unit demand from both Pro and DIY customers as well as our investments in job lot quantities. And in tools, we saw strength across all segments of power tools, along with growth in tool storage and mechanics tools, driven by the CRAFTSMAN brand as customers took to doing projects at home. Our lawn and garden and seasonal and outdoor living teams also delivered comps above company average this quarter, driven by seasonal demand and customers focused on enjoying their outdoor space.  \n Our strong execution and powerful brand assortment allowed us to meet the elevated demand with brands such as Weber and Char-Broil, the top 2 brands in outdoor grilling, and an outstanding outdoor power equipment lineup featuring John Deere, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Honda and the Ariens brands. And today, I'm particularly excited that we are building on our industry-leading portfolio of outdoor power brands with EGO, which is the #1 brand in battery-powered outdoor power equipment. Lowe's is already the #1 destination in outdoor power equipment. And the addition of the EGO brand to our arsenal now only reinforces that leading position.  \n Beginning in December of 2020, Lowe's will be the exclusive nationwide home center to offer EGO's innovative battery-powered mowers, trimmers, chainsaws and blowers. In addition, Lowe's will begin offering select skilled battery-powered outdoor power equipment in late 2020, which includes mowers, leaf blowers and trimmers. The addition of the EGO brand furthers our commitment to expanding our assortment of sustainable products. EGO's battery-powered equipment is capable of matching or exceeding the performance of conventional gas items, which supports our corporate sustainability efforts.  \n In hardware, we continue to expand our Pro brand offering with the national launch of Simpson Strong-Tie framing hardware and fasteners this quarter in conjunction with the Just For Pros customer acquisition event. This product offering meets a critical need for the Pro in building out their projects, so we're now able to further extend our relationship with the Pro customer by helping them fulfill all their hardware needs in one place.  \n And as Marvin mentioned, we are pleased to see higher-than-expected online sales this quarter, along with a significant increase in downloads of our mobile app as well as improved customer ratings. We have also continued to enhance our omnichannel capabilities in the store with the launch of mobile check-in for curbside pickup that occurred in early July. This is also that customers can now let us know when they're on their way and when they've arrived at the store to pick up their order. And we added an internal order picking app to improve our associates' speed and accuracy in fulfilling these orders.  \n We are also focused on other extensions of our omnichannel capabilities. With our transition of Lowes.com to the cloud now fully complete, the teams are working quickly to accelerate the front-end work and deliver improved customer-facing capabilities in the second half of this year, such as online delivery scheduling, online order tracking, a dynamic customized homepage, simplified search and navigation and an expanded online product offering to further enhance the customer experience and to continue to grow sales.  \n As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we're excited to build on our retail fundamentals foundation. Consistent with our long-term plans, we are continuing with our merchandising investment in our stores with resets to address our product adjacencies that make it easier for the customer to shop, all with a focus on the Pro. This work will be done throughout the back half of the year. And we expect to touch the majority of our stores by the end of the fiscal year. And as we plan for the holiday season, when customers are expected to stay closer to home this year with a keen focus on home improvement projects, we are prepared and committed to serve their needs for fall preparation projects, remodel activity, space conversion projects, holiday decorating and gifting, along with core repair and maintenance activity.  \n In closing, I'd be remiss if I didn't again express our appreciation for our vendor partners, who again went above and beyond to help keep our shelves stocked despite facing unprecedented demand and their own operational challenges related to COVID-19. Across building products, home decor and our hard lines businesses, there were a number of standout performances again this quarter.\n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Dave. \nDavid Denton: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the company's liquidity position and our capital allocation priorities. Last quarter, we decided to raise some incremental capital in light of the disruption in the global credit markets.\n After issuing $4 billion in senior notes and increasing the capacity of our revolving credit facilities by nearly $800 million, we now have $11.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Additionally, we have $3 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities. So in total, we have an immediate access to $14.6 billion in funds, and we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to navigate any unforeseen circumstances. At the end of our Q2, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.4x.  \n During the quarter, the company generated $11 billion in free cash flow, driven by exceptionally strong operating performance. In the long term, we remain committed to delivering robust shareholder returns through our disciplined capital allocation program, consisting of 3 main pillars: first is strategically investing in our business to drive outsized returns; second is supporting our 35% dividend payout target; and finally, returning capital to our shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases.  \n However, as you know, we have currently suspended share repurchases in light of the unprecedented environment created by the pandemic. We continue to support our dividend program, and we returned $416 million to our shareholders by paying a dividend of $0.55 per share in the quarter. And importantly, we are investing in growth initiatives to build on the momentum that we are seeing across our business. In Q2, capital expenditures totaled $382 million. We continue to prioritize investments in our omnichannel capabilities as our customers are shopping more online.  \n Now turning to the income statement. In Q2, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.74 compared to $2.14 last year, an increase of 75%. In the quarter, there was a very modest impact on operating income related to the previously announced Canadian restructuring. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons, where applicable. \n In Q2, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.75, an increase of 74% compared to the prior year. These results surpassed our expectations due to higher-than-expected sales, gross margin rate and SG&A leverage as well as our strong execution to meet robust customer demand. Q2 sales were $27.3 billion, an increase of 34.2% on a comparable basis versus the prior year. This was driven by transaction growth of 22.6% and total average ticket growth of 11.6% as we saw strong repeat rates from new and existing customers.\n U.S. comp sales were up 35.1% in the quarter with truly broad-based strength across all geographies and across both DIY and Pro customers. Lowes.com sales growth remained robust, increasing 135% in the quarter. Given all of our previously announced investments in the product and service offerings for the Pro, we were particularly pleased to see mid-20% growth for the Pro customer in Q2.\n Our U.S. monthly comps were strong throughout the quarter with 41.5% in May, 34.4% in June and 28.2% in July. It's important to note that we delivered these strong comps despite significantly reducing promotions during the quarter. Throughout the quarter, we saw strong COVID-related demand, driven by customers working on incremental projects to make their homes as safe and as functional as possible. It's clear that homes have become multifunctional spaces for many families, a place for work, for school and for residence. We've also seen wallet share shift away from other forms of discretionary spending, shifting into home repair and maintenance work. \n Our sales also benefited from excellent execution and strong service levels across our stores in response to this unprecedented demand. Of note, sales trends remained strong in areas of the country where COVID-19 had been resurging. In August, we've continued to see the strong broad-based sales trend that we experienced in July with strength across both DIY and Pro customers. Month-to-date, August U.S. comp sales trends are materially consistent with July's performance levels. \n Gross margin was 34.1% of sales in the second quarter, an increase of 197 basis points compared to the second quarter of '19. Gross margin rate improved 137 basis points, driven by benefits from our improved pricing and promotional strategies. Favorable product mix also drove approximately 60 basis points of benefit. \n SG&A was 18.4% of sales in Q2, a 90 basis point improvement over LY. The company delivered a substantial improvement in operating leverage despite $430 million of COVID-related expenses. These investments included $260 million in financial assistance for our frontline associates, approximately $75 million related to cleaning and other safety-related programs and approximately $95 million in charitable contributions.  \n While $430 million of COVID-related expenses negatively impacted SG&A leverage by 157 basis points, this was more than offset by: payroll leverage of 110 basis points related to higher sales volume and improved store operating efficiencies; advertising leverage of 35 basis points; employee insurance leverage of 40 basis points; and occupancy leverage of 40 basis points. Adjusted operating income margin increased 311 basis points to 14.5% of sales, driven both by robust sales and improved operating efficiencies. \n The effective tax rate of 24.4% was in line with our expectations and consistent with the prior year. At $13.8 billion, inventory was essentially flat compared to the prior year levels as the supply chain worked to meet elevated customer demand throughout the quarter.  \n Now before I close, let me address our 2020 business outlook. As I indicated last quarter, we have suspended our guidance. In this unprecedented operating environment, we, like many other companies, have limited visibility into the future business trends, which result in an unusually wide range of potential outcomes for our financial performance. Having said that, I'd like to provide some perspective on the second half of the year. \n First, we expect that our top line growth will moderate somewhat from Q2 levels, although demand is still expected to remain strong as consumers continue to invest in their homes. Further, we expect that our improved product offerings and customer service will allow us to retain new Pro and DIY customers. Now keep in mind that both the third and fourth quarters are typically smaller revenue quarters, given the natural demand patterns of the home improvement sector.  \n For the remainder of the year, we expect that promotional activity will increase modestly but will not return to the prior year levels. We will also be lapping harder prior year comparisons as our sequential gross margin performance improved as we moved through 2019. As such, we expect lower levels of gross margin expansion in the second half of 2020 relative to the second quarter.  \n Turning to expenses. We anticipate that we will incur COVID-related operating expenses of approximately $70 million to $80 million per quarter to support safety and cleanliness in our stores. And importantly, we are making significant investments in our business to support the long-term growth and enhanced returns. Some of these investments include merchandising resets and expansion of our supply chain infrastructure. In the back half of this year, many of these projects are weighted more heavily towards expense rather than capital. Based on all of these factors, we anticipate that operating income margin flow-through will moderate in the second half versus the first half. We're still planning for approximately $1.6 billion in CapEx for the year with a continued focus on omnichannel investments.\n In closing, we are operating in a robust sector with strong underlying demand trends. We are investing in our business to further our capabilities, so we can continue to disproportionately capitalize on these trends. We have a strong balance sheet, and we remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation program, which should lead to long-term shareholder value creation. \n So with that, I thank you. We're now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Nice quarter. I'm going to apologize, this will sound like the broken record question. I wanted to ask about the 12% EBIT margin target, realize an actual goal in terms of timing was never given, but that this environment probably speeds it up. Can you talk about 12%? I think some of the math to get there in the near term or medium term would imply that sales continued to grow at a nice rate but expenses actually get deleted or your productivity gets a lot better. So can you talk about the reality or the realistic nature of doing that in the next, call it, 12 to 18 months? \nDavid Denton: Chris, this is Dave. I think you're right. Obviously, we are very focused on delivering upon that 12% operating margin target. And keep in mind, that's just a step function. That's not the end. We think we can do better than that over time. It's clear at this point in time, we're trending a bit ahead of that, given just how our business is performing. But having said that, we still have a lot of investments that we're making to be sure that we can consistently deliver that 12% day in and day out. \n I think you heard us talk about this morning that we're investing in assortment and merchandise in the store environment. We're making really important strategic investments in our online capabilities and technology platform as well as in our supply chain. And we continue to focus in those areas to make sure that we can consistently deliver both really strong top line performance, manage gross margin at a reasonable rate, leverage SG&A in a meaningful way, so we can deliver that off-base target over time. \nSimeon Gutman: And Dave, is there any different thought with regard to gross margin? I know that, right, it's benefiting in the near term from lack of promotions. And you're expecting that level of promotion to continue or to rise to be a little bit less of a benefit going forward. But is there some level -- or is the calculus of getting to the 12% any different, where gross margin ends up being a little bit better in that -- than you thought initially? \nDavid Denton: I don't know that there's anything materially that's changed there. Clearly, 2019, we had a bit of a step down in gross margin. Our objective in 2020 and beyond was to get our margin rate back. Keep in mind that we are making investments in supply chain that will disproportionately dampen gross margin rate but will allow us to lever SG&A more productively over time. So you have some natural kind of geography shift within the P&L, Simeon. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Marvin, do you think there's been any structural shift, meaning that this growth you're experiencing now won't just be a one-shot deal that will be given back next year when people go back to traveling and eating out? Said another way, under what conditions do you think you can comp positive next year when you lap all of this? \nMarvin Ellison: Mike, I think it's a fair question. Next year is difficult for all the obvious macro reasons. But we feel good about our business trends. And look, I don't want to minimize the impact of what we describe as retail fundamentals. We talked about getting foundational things in place here at Lowe's for the last 18 months. And they're paying dividends. Getting dot-com on the cloud, hiring an experienced team of home improvement and retail experts in key functional areas, new price management system, field merchants, focus on Pro, I mean, all of these things matter. And when we think about market share and we think about the sustainability of it, our data is pretty consistent that when customers shop us in store or online, they have a good experience. They come back. When customers shop us in our stores, especially in this environment and they feel safe, they come back. \n We've done an analysis that suggests that our COVID-19 safety protocols in our stores are amongst the strongest in the industry. And Forbes ranked Lowe's #6 on their list relative to that. And our research tells us that when customers show up in our environment, specifically during this COVID-19 crisis and they feel safe and they feel well taken care of, they come back. And when you look at our first half results, it demonstrates that customers are coming back over and over again. And so we believe that of all the things within our control, if we can execute these at a continual high level, then the rest will take care of itself. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. Then my follow-up question is of the mid-20s percent Pro comp that you experienced, what portion of that came from new pros that Lowe's hasn't been regularly interacting with? And where did you grab these from? And maybe somewhat unrelated, Dave, you mentioned that promotions are going to pick up in the back half of the year. Why would that be the case if the environment stays the same? \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. So Michael, let me take the first part of the Pro question, then I'll hand it to Joe and he can give you a little bit more context. We feel really good about our Pro business. And we stated in the prepared comments that DIY outperformed Pro from a comp perspective. But we expected that in this environment. But we also know that we had increased performance in our urban areas. And we think that, that was driven by our improved performance in Pro as well as our omnichannel and online performance, which you have to have in those urban markets. So I'll let Joe just briefly cover a little bit about the Pro segmentation that we have. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Thanks for the question, Mike. Our strong Pro demand with comps in the mid-20s continues. And it's really around our -- the investments that we've been making in both the product and the service offerings. So it's things like our job lot quantities, our dedicated supervisors, our Pro parking, our loaders, et cetera, et cetera. And as we now move to the more strategic phase of our Pro growth initiatives, what we're really excited about the progress we're making, things like our Pro loyalty platform that's integrated with CRM, keeping Pros working through the partnerships that I've announced at HomeAdvisor and JobSIGHT, really excited about our announcement of the tool rental. And so as these Pro customers continue coming back, seeing new product additions like Simpson Strong-Tie, and so we feel very good about the future of our Pro business. \nDavid Denton: And Michael, as it relates to pros, I'll ask Bill to comment here a bit as well. But clearly, as we cycle in the back half of the year, we do think promotions will tick up just a little bit. I don't think it will be a material change. But I think it is important that we communicate really the value that we're offering to both consumers and the pros, the breadth of offering that we have at Lowe's. And I think because of that, you'll see just a slight tick-up, but I don't think a material change from a commercial cadence perspective. I'll ask Bill to... \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Just to -- Michael, just to add on what Dave was saying, I think we've clearly got to realize that gift centers and the holiday trim and tree programs were all committed for and bought prior to COVID happening. And so those were well in motion and on the way. And those are things that we have to work our way through based on how the consumer responds to those programs. But I think it's also important to clarify that during the quarter and during the first half of this year, we were dramatically less promotional all around building around our pricing and promo strategy that we've been working to put in place over the last 20 months, which has been a focus on everyday values and being priced right every day for our customer. And so really pleased with the traction that we're making with the teams. And I think as we look at the back half, it's not like we're going to go from one side of the road to the other and just get back into the promotional game. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Great results. Marvin, I just wanted you guys could just speak to the opportunity on the digital front now that you've completed the migration to the cloud, I guess, just to size up the opportunity for you guys in the back half and even into next year. \nMarvin Ellison: Well, we think it's significant. I mean we've talked from the very beginning about the importance of modernizing our online business. And I just can't help but reiterate that just a year ago, we were on a decade-old platform. And we were slowing our growth because we were disappointing customers. So the ability for Seemantini and her team to get this replatforming effort done in the second quarter is monumental for us because it gives us so much agility and flexibility to build on that platform. We're not going to put any numbers to that, Chuck, because I think in this environment, it's really difficult. \n But what we do know is that it will be impossible for us to deliver 135% comp as we did in the second quarter without that replatforming effort. Because our instability was such that back in Black Friday of 2018, the volume we had crashed the whole system. And we've had volume that exceeded that for probably 90 straight days. So that tells you where we were and where we are. I'll let Bill talk a little bit about some of the specific things coming online that we think will continue to build that business and open up to a whole new set of customers that will continue to rediscover Lowe's. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. I think it's important to note that during the quarter, all 15 departments grew at or above double-digit rates for dot-com. All -- and the migration to the cloud, obviously, allowed for speed, allowed for us to be nimble. But we've got improved checkout and navigation continuing to happen as we go through the back half. We've continued to work on separating freight from costs. And if you remember our comments on this before, this will help make sure that competitive pricing shows up online the way it needs to show up online, continue to enhance our curbside pickup, working with Joe's team in store, continuing to improve our buy online, pick up in store process to make that store picking faster. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the store picking app, that's all around designing for the associate to be able to handle the customer with speed. So we've got a lot of efforts going in addition to adding SKUs and improving the content that we put out there on dot-com on a daily and weekly basis. \nMarvin Ellison: So Chuck, we're not trying to avoid answering the specifics of the question. It's just really tough to forecast. We just know that we have a much better platform that we can take that demand and manage it as it comes our way. \nCharles Grom: That's helpful. And then just taking a step back, the long-term sales per square foot target, I believe, is around $370. You're going to hit that number pretty easily this year. So I just to kind of build off of Simeon's question about margins but thinking about it from a sales productivity perspective, you're still about roughly $100 below your biggest peer. I'm just wondering if you guys just size up the opportunity of how much more productive your stores can be, that would kind of lend support that you guys actually should be able to comp to strong results in the next couple of years. \nDavid Denton: Yes. Chuck, Dave here. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of opportunity here. Part of what we're doing is investing in our infrastructure such that our base can become a lot more productive day in and day out. And you heard Joe speak about all the investments we're making from a technology perspective within the store environment such that we can really leverage the hours that we have in our stores to put more of those hours to work facing customers and actually driving increased sales and productivity as we move volume through the box. So I think there's a big opportunity. You'll see us continue to talk about it and push on it. And actually, even leveraging the omnichannel environment will also help that. Because if we engage consumers both in the store and online, it really helps us leverage those fixed costs across our platform. \nMarvin Ellison: So Chuck, this is Marvin. And I'll just add this last point. So if you think about where the opportunity exists for us to increase sales per square foot, first, it starts with what Dave talked about and Bill discussed in his prepared comments regarding the work we're going to do in the second half to get our adjacencies corrected and to go in and drive more bay productivity based on how we are merchandising the floor and also creating a more intuitive shopping experience. This sounds very basic. But we all were surprised with the poor adjacency structure in our stores and how most stores don't even have planograms in the system. And so it's almost impossible to merchandise and to have a good replenishment strategy. So that's number one. \n Number two, you have 3 things that are going to drive productivity in existing stores: an increased penetration in Pro, an improved e-commerce and omnichannel infrastructure and a better install business. And we have negative comp in installed business last year. We've discussed dot-com to a high degree of detail and we've also talked a lot about Pro. And so all of these investments are part of our strategy to hit those targets that you talked about. And we think we're well on our way to making some progress. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. \nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli. I think one of your bigger productivity unlocks was shifting some of the big -- large inventory categories, like appliances, out of the stores and back into the fulfillment network. Can you update us where you are on that front? And related to that, are there any large productivity initiatives that you've maybe had to delay because of the unexpected sales surge? \nMarvin Ellison: Scot, I'll take it. This is Marvin. So I'll take the second part first. No, I mean, we hadn't really delayed any large project. Dave mentioned, to the contrary, we've decided to push projects up that drive productivity and also that impact the improvement of our omnichannel strategy because we believe that we're behind. And candidly, we want to come out of this COVID-19 crisis a better company than we were going into it. And we think we're making progress in that area. \n Relative to supply chain and our transition of products like appliances out, we're in the early stages of that. I reiterated in my prepared comments that we are going to have an aggressive 18-month strategy to roll out, deliver cross-dock and bulk distribution centers and also online fulfillment centers. Our pilots have proven successful in getting appliances and bulk product out of our backrooms into more centralized, local distribution or delivery. And you're going to see us accelerate that in the back half of the year going into next year. \nScot Ciccarelli: That's really helpful. And can you just give us a quick update on where you are in terms of the customer-facing hours versus tasking? \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. Let me hand that to Joe and he can give you some specifics. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Scot. So we've made significant progress. We're ahead of our 60-40 goal. We continue to engineer out tasking in the stores to improve customer service. We are well on our way and ahead of our 60-40 goal. \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. And Scot, the last point I'll make, just giving credit to Joe's team and the IT team. Without some of the advancements in technology, like the new labor scheduling system, I mean, we would be in a much different position as a company, trying to serve the needs of the customer and the needs of the associates in this unique environment. But having a system that gives us the ability to manage to the unique needs of both customers and associates, that system was put in place last year, it's created just an enormous benefit to our ability to not only serve customers but to drive productivity. So proud of the progress of Joe and the operations team. And we think we'll hit that target before what we committed to because it's just the right thing to do for our associates but also for our shareholders. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: And Dave, maybe the first one for you, just given the number of facilities being stood up over the next 18 months. And you sort of mentioned the geography shifts in the prepared remarks. But can you help us better understand the P&L implications? I mean should we expect a net margin headwind, I guess, an incremental one, given the pull-forward here? Or are there enough offsetting factors to neutralize the initiative as you roll it out? \nDavid Denton: Steven, just keep in mind that what we have done here is consistent with our long-term plan because we were always in the mode of investing in the supply chain that we knew would drive incremental costs and dampen gross margin rate but would alleviate some SG&A pressure in the stores and across our platform. So I think the plan over the long term is consistent with that. Clearly, when you make investments in the short term, you have to stand up the facilities in advance for them being at full productivity level, so there will be some near-term headwinds. And that's somewhat of the commentary you heard me speak about as you thought about the back half of 2020 is really due to that fact. \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. I think -- and Steve, this is Marvin. The only point I'll add is, obviously, this is part of our plan. But we also have things we're implementing that will be offset. And I talked about the price management system. And the continued maturation of that system gives Bill and his team a lot more understanding to drive benefits relative to pricing and also having a more balanced promotional strategy. \n Some of the things that Joe is putting in the stores from a productivity perspective that's helping us to get that balanced payroll, which also drives operating income improvement. So there will be offsets to go along with the investments we're making. This is not really a pull-forward. This is really a reminder of where we are in the process, so it keeps us on track. We're not getting off track, and we're not going to create any downside scenarios that we didn't anticipate. \nSteven Forbes: And then just a quick follow-up. I guess, Dave, again starting with you. As you noted, right, the expectation for, I guess, a moderation, right, in top line growth as we head into the back half of the year. But any context on how that pertains to both the DIY and Pro customers? Is there any sort of, I guess, dichotomy between the 2 channels or 2 customer segments? \nDavid Denton: Listen, I don't think so. Listen, I think we've seen really strong growth and retention of both new and repeat customers in our channel, both from a Pro perspective and DIY. I think just practically speaking, we're going into kind of the season which demand begins to moderate just from a natural progression perspective. And I think that's just what we're trying to call out as you think about the back half of the year. I think we're really nicely positioned from a merchandising perspective and from a labor perspective that we're going to really do well from a service perspective and have the right product in stores and online to meet the demand for these customers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nSeth Sigman: Given the strength over the last few months, we get a lot of questions about pull-forward. I guess as you look at the composition of sales through the second quarter and then obviously early here in the third quarter, are you seeing any change in the types of projects that consumers are working on? Anything that maybe helps give you confidence that demand through this period has been incremental versus pull-forward? How are you guys thinking about that? \nMarvin Ellison: We do not see it as pull-forward. I think what we've tried to articulate is that this is a really unique environment, where most of us are forced to spend more time at home than we ever have in our lifetimes. And so those customers are finding projects around the house that have been on the list, they just hadn't got a chance to get to them or candidly they just didn't notice them. So we don't see this as a pull-forward. This is more of an incremental add. \n In addition to that, as I mentioned, we've been running a negative install business for the past couple of years. And Bill Boltz and his merchandising teams made big investments last year in updating our flooring showrooms in our stores and updating our kitchen showrooms. We believe that those investments in the store has led to us improving our install business this year, along with the restructuring of the field team that Joe took on. \n So the short answer is we don't see this as pull-forward. We see it as incremental just based on the unique environment that we're in. And we also see it as market share gain. I mean it's difficult for a company our size to grow sales by 35% comp without having some significant market share gain that's happening as well. \nSeth Sigman: Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a question on the regional consistency. It's helpful to get that color and it's obviously a very good trend that it's been so consistent throughout this period. I'm just curious, have you seen any change in comps or the composition of categories in markets where COVID cases have started to pick up? \nDavid Denton: No. We have not. I think actually where COVID has picked up, we've seen very strong demand in those markets. And it's been pretty consistent, so we really have not seen a material change in there. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: So I wanted to follow up on DIY versus Pro. And I think some of your comments suggest that DIY was maybe up closer to 40% in the quarter versus Pro up 25%. But has that gap narrowed this quarter? I think at one point, it was said that Pro is up mid-20s and you sort of implied that the whole company is up mid-20s in August. So that would imply that, that gap has narrowed. Is that a correct assumption? \nMarvin Ellison: I would say your assumption is correct on the ratio between Pro and DIY, relative to a composition change, not so much. I mean this is a unique environment. And most of 2019, our Pro comps outperformed DIY. The shift occurred, obviously, during this COVID-19 crisis, where customers are spending more time at home. And in some cases, they're still a little apprehensive to allow contractors in their home. So we think those combination of factors is driving the resurgence in DIY. We have to be more penetrated from a DIY perspective as a company. Our Pro business is growing, but DIY has always been a strength, and we think that we're benefiting from the current trends. \nMichael Baker: Okay, makes sense. One more follow-up on indoor versus outdoor. So you gave us the indoor comp. Could you just share with us the outdoor comp or percent of indoor versus outdoor and then we could back into the outdoor comp? But more importantly, how does that percent change as we go through the back half of the year? How much bigger does indoor get relative to outdoor? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, what I would say is we've given plenty competition information. So we're not going to give you any more specifics on ratios because we think we've given enough to provide context and color. But going into the back half of the year, this shifts inside versus outside just due to weather and seasonality. I'll let Bill talk a little bit about what our focus is on the inside and the back half because it's something that we've been working quite a bit on. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. I think to play off of Marvin's comments, as we shift to the fall business, it naturally shifts indoor. But in the southern parts of the country, there's still a lot of outdoor projects that get done as the weather cools. But for the northern markets, the Pro moves inside, the consumer moves inside, flooring, kitchens, bath, those types of projects, all about getting the home ready for the holidays is where the customers focus. And then you have your natural fall businesses, right? So fall businesses continue to play. Those are a little less seasonal than the spring time frame. And they're all really driven based on what Mother Nature brings. So that's really what drives the back half of the year. \nMichael Baker: Okay. One more which might be helpful for everyone, if I could. You talked a lot about COVID. Where we've seen the COVID spikes, business remained strong. I guess I'd be concerned about the opposite, where COVID is sort of calming down, are we seeing people move away from the home? \nDavid Denton: We have not actually seen our business in those areas actually improve. \nMarvin Ellison: So -- and the last point I'd make, we have 15 geographic regions. All 15 were 30% comp or higher. I mean that's a pretty unprecedented number. And that illustrates the consistency of demand across rural, urban and all types of geographies in the country. And we think that is also consistent with really good execution by the merchandising and stores team to drive the business as well as outstanding work from our store leaders out there every day, doing incredible job for customers and communities. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start out by thanking our associates for their tremendous actions to support our customers and communities across both the U.S. and Canada. We are grateful for their hard work and ongoing commitment to safety. Without question, this has been the most challenging personal and business environment that any of us have operated in. Throughout all the uncertainty that we faced in the second quarter, we never lost focus that our #1 priority as a company is protecting the health and well-being of our associates and customers through a safe store environment and shopping experience.  \n In the second quarter, we continued to prioritize the financial support of our associates and community while providing the customers with the products and services they need to manage and care for their homes. We were pleased and humbled that we were the first choice for many customers who needed home improvement items for their businesses and homes during this unprecedented time. And I would like to thank those customers who trusted us and for rediscovering Lowe's.  \n More specifically, during the second quarter, we invested an incremental $460 million in support for our frontline associates, communities and store safety. Through the first half of 2020, the company has invested $560 million in incremental financial support for our associates. In recognizing that helping people make their homes better extends into our neighborhoods, communities and country, we've committed $55 million in grants to support minority-owned and rural small businesses. In total, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we've committed $100 million of assistance to those in our community who need it most.  \n Our financial results this quarter demonstrate that we've experienced unprecedented demand in many of our business categories due to customers spending more time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these results could not have been realized without our efforts over the past 18 months to implement our retail fundamental strategy, which dramatically improved and modernized our business infrastructure. These modernization efforts have created technology and operational platforms to meet customer demand and grow our business during these challenging times. And some of these initiatives include hiring home improvement and retail subject matter experts in key leadership roles, which has allowed us to quickly make informed decisions and implement necessary changes during the COVID-19 crisis; replatforming Lowes.com from a decade-old infrastructure to the cloud and developing a top-rated mobile app that's allowed us to grow online sales triple digits; a customer-centric labor scheduling system that gave stores the flexibility to align payroll with the unique needs of the customer and the associate; deploying a new price management system to provide our merchants with better data to maintain cost discipline and take more strategic approach to pricing and promotions; enhanced Pro product and service offerings, combined with the new Pro loyalty platform, that helps us keep pros working and offers them meaningful rewards while providing us with better customer insights; and our field merchants and merchandise service teams who play an essential role in helping our stores quickly reconfigure to support social distancing and also respond to the significant increase in demand. While we still have work to do, we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far to modernize our company. And we're looking forward to building on this momentum in the back half of 2020 and for years to come.  \n Now let me turn to our second quarter results. We delivered strong sales growth beyond our expectations with total company comp sales growing 34.2% over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share grew 75% to $3.74. Our U.S. home improvement comps was 35.1% due to robust project demand from DIY and Pro customers that was broad-based across channels, product categories and geographies. Overall, we saw a sharp acceleration from Q1 demand trends, including significant increases in the number of new Pro and DIY and millennial customers.  \n DIY comps outpaced Pro comps in the quarter, driven by a consumer mindset that was heavily focused on the home and wallet share shifts away from other activities, like dining out, vacations and purchasing apparel. Pro sales were also strong with comps in the mid-20s with demand accelerating in May and remaining strong throughout the quarter. Our Pro performance was supported by the progress we've made with retail fundamentals, like job lot quantities and improved service levels.  \n From a geographic perspective, growth was balanced across the U.S. store footprint with positive comps of 30% or more in all 15 geographic regions in all 3 U.S. divisions. Importantly, we saw strong sales trends in urban areas. In fact, comp sales in our urban markets outperformed remote or rural markets by over 500 basis points. This is an important data point because it reflects the success of our business model in all geographic settings as well as the importance of having a strong Pro business as well as an effective omnichannel strategy to compete in urban settings.  \n Our Lowes.com comp sales grew 135% as Pro and DIY customers increasingly shopped online, driving online penetration to 8% of sales. And as I mentioned earlier, we completed the replatform of Lowes.com to the cloud during the quarter. This enabled us to improve site functionality and sustain triple-digit growth without any systems interruptions. I'm very pleased with the work of our CIO, Seemantini Godbole, and her team to complete this replatforming effort in record time.  \n And in Canada, we posted positive comps that exceeded 20%, driven by similar consumer focus on the home as well as strong execution by our new leadership team. While we're pleased with their efforts to serve the incremental demand this quarter, our Canadian team remains focused on the work ahead to improve operating efficiency while driving sales.  \n Looking ahead, we are confident that we'll continue to build on the momentum that we delivered in the first half. And in the second half of this year, we are reinvesting in the business to elevate our product, simplify our store environment and improve our service offering. These investments will include store resets to improve product adjacencies, bay productivity and sales per square feet.  \n We're also advancing our supply chain infrastructure with our recent announcement that we'll open 50 cross-dock delivery terminals, 7 bulk distribution centers and 4 e-commerce fulfillment centers over the next 18 months. Our investments in our stores and investments in our supply chain evolution reinforces our commitment to becoming a world-class omnichannel retailer. We're making the right investments to drive long-term sales growth, operating profitability and sustainable shareholder returns.  \n In closing, I'd like to reiterate how incredibly proud I am of our associates and their dedication to supporting customers in our communities during this time when they need us most. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe. Mike, I think it's a fair question. Next year is difficult for all the obvious macro reasons. But we feel good about our business trends. And look, I don't want to minimize the impact of what we describe as retail fundamentals. We talked about getting foundational things in place here at Lowe's for the last 18 months. And they're paying dividends. Getting dot-com on the cloud, hiring an experienced team of home improvement and retail experts in key functional areas, new price management system, field merchants, focus on Pro, I mean, all of these things matter. And when we think about market share and we think about the sustainability of it, our data is pretty consistent that when customers shop us in store or online, they have a good experience. They come back. When customers shop us in our stores, especially in this environment and they feel safe, they come back. \n We've done an analysis that suggests that our COVID-19 safety protocols in our stores are amongst the strongest in the industry. And Forbes ranked Lowe's #6 on their list relative to that. And our research tells us that when customers show up in our environment, specifically during this COVID-19 crisis and they feel safe and they feel well taken care of, they come back. And when you look at our first half results, it demonstrates that customers are coming back over and over again. And so we believe that of all the things within our control, if we can execute these at a continual high level, then the rest will take care of itself. Yes. So Michael, let me take the first part of the Pro question, then I'll hand it to Joe and he can give you a little bit more context. We feel really good about our Pro business. And we stated in the prepared comments that DIY outperformed Pro from a comp perspective. But we expected that in this environment. But we also know that we had increased performance in our urban areas. And we think that, that was driven by our improved performance in Pro as well as our omnichannel and online performance, which you have to have in those urban markets. So I'll let Joe just briefly cover a little bit about the Pro segmentation that we have. Well, we think it's significant. I mean we've talked from the very beginning about the importance of modernizing our online business. And I just can't help but reiterate that just a year ago, we were on a decade-old platform. And we were slowing our growth because we were disappointing customers. So the ability for Seemantini and her team to get this replatforming effort done in the second quarter is monumental for us because it gives us so much agility and flexibility to build on that platform. We're not going to put any numbers to that, Chuck, because I think in this environment, it's really difficult. \n But what we do know is that it will be impossible for us to deliver 135% comp as we did in the second quarter without that replatforming effort. Because our instability was such that back in Black Friday of 2018, the volume we had crashed the whole system. And we've had volume that exceeded that for probably 90 straight days. So that tells you where we were and where we are. I'll let Bill talk a little bit about some of the specific things coming online that we think will continue to build that business and open up to a whole new set of customers that will continue to rediscover Lowe's. So Chuck, we're not trying to avoid answering the specifics of the question. It's just really tough to forecast. We just know that we have a much better platform that we can take that demand and manage it as it comes our way. So Chuck, this is Marvin. And I'll just add this last point. So if you think about where the opportunity exists for us to increase sales per square foot, first, it starts with what Dave talked about and Bill discussed in his prepared comments regarding the work we're going to do in the second half to get our adjacencies corrected and to go in and drive more bay productivity based on how we are merchandising the floor and also creating a more intuitive shopping experience. This sounds very basic. But we all were surprised with the poor adjacency structure in our stores and how most stores don't even have planograms in the system. And so it's almost impossible to merchandise and to have a good replenishment strategy. So that's number one. \n Number two, you have 3 things that are going to drive productivity in existing stores: an increased penetration in Pro, an improved e-commerce and omnichannel infrastructure and a better install business. And we have negative comp in installed business last year. We've discussed dot-com to a high degree of detail and we've also talked a lot about Pro. And so all of these investments are part of our strategy to hit those targets that you talked about. And we think we're well on our way to making some progress. Scot, I'll take it. This is Marvin. So I'll take the second part first. No, I mean, we hadn't really delayed any large project. Dave mentioned, to the contrary, we've decided to push projects up that drive productivity and also that impact the improvement of our omnichannel strategy because we believe that we're behind. And candidly, we want to come out of this COVID-19 crisis a better company than we were going into it. And we think we're making progress in that area. \n Relative to supply chain and our transition of products like appliances out, we're in the early stages of that. I reiterated in my prepared comments that we are going to have an aggressive 18-month strategy to roll out, deliver cross-dock and bulk distribution centers and also online fulfillment centers. Our pilots have proven successful in getting appliances and bulk product out of our backrooms into more centralized, local distribution or delivery. And you're going to see us accelerate that in the back half of the year going into next year. Yes. Let me hand that to Joe and he can give you some specifics. Yes. And Scot, the last point I'll make, just giving credit to Joe's team and the IT team. Without some of the advancements in technology, like the new labor scheduling system, I mean, we would be in a much different position as a company, trying to serve the needs of the customer and the needs of the associates in this unique environment. But having a system that gives us the ability to manage to the unique needs of both customers and associates, that system was put in place last year, it's created just an enormous benefit to our ability to not only serve customers but to drive productivity. So proud of the progress of Joe and the operations team. And we think we'll hit that target before what we committed to because it's just the right thing to do for our associates but also for our shareholders. Yes. I think -- and Steve, this is Marvin. The only point I'll add is, obviously, this is part of our plan. But we also have things we're implementing that will be offset. And I talked about the price management system. And the continued maturation of that system gives Bill and his team a lot more understanding to drive benefits relative to pricing and also having a more balanced promotional strategy. \n Some of the things that Joe is putting in the stores from a productivity perspective that's helping us to get that balanced payroll, which also drives operating income improvement. So there will be offsets to go along with the investments we're making. This is not really a pull-forward. This is really a reminder of where we are in the process, so it keeps us on track. We're not getting off track, and we're not going to create any downside scenarios that we didn't anticipate. We do not see it as pull-forward. I think what we've tried to articulate is that this is a really unique environment, where most of us are forced to spend more time at home than we ever have in our lifetimes. And so those customers are finding projects around the house that have been on the list, they just hadn't got a chance to get to them or candidly they just didn't notice them. So we don't see this as a pull-forward. This is more of an incremental add. \n In addition to that, as I mentioned, we've been running a negative install business for the past couple of years. And Bill Boltz and his merchandising teams made big investments last year in updating our flooring showrooms in our stores and updating our kitchen showrooms. We believe that those investments in the store has led to us improving our install business this year, along with the restructuring of the field team that Joe took on. \n So the short answer is we don't see this as pull-forward. We see it as incremental just based on the unique environment that we're in. And we also see it as market share gain. I mean it's difficult for a company our size to grow sales by 35% comp without having some significant market share gain that's happening as well. I would say your assumption is correct on the ratio between Pro and DIY, relative to a composition change, not so much. I mean this is a unique environment. And most of 2019, our Pro comps outperformed DIY. The shift occurred, obviously, during this COVID-19 crisis, where customers are spending more time at home. And in some cases, they're still a little apprehensive to allow contractors in their home. So we think those combination of factors is driving the resurgence in DIY. We have to be more penetrated from a DIY perspective as a company. Our Pro business is growing, but DIY has always been a strength, and we think that we're benefiting from the current trends. Well, what I would say is we've given plenty competition information. So we're not going to give you any more specifics on ratios because we think we've given enough to provide context and color.

            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the company's liquidity position and our capital allocation priorities. Last quarter, we decided to raise some incremental capital in light of the disruption in the global credit markets.\n After issuing $4 billion in senior notes and increasing the capacity of our revolving credit facilities by nearly $800 million, we now have $11.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Additionally, we have $3 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities. So in total, we have an immediate access to $14.6 billion in funds, and we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to navigate any unforeseen circumstances. At the end of our Q2, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.4x.  \n During the quarter, the company generated $11 billion in free cash flow, driven by exceptionally strong operating performance. In the long term, we remain committed to delivering robust shareholder returns through our disciplined capital allocation program, consisting of 3 main pillars: first is strategically investing in our business to drive outsized returns; second is supporting our 35% dividend payout target; and finally, returning capital to our shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases.  \n However, as you know, we have currently suspended share repurchases in light of the unprecedented environment created by the pandemic. We continue to support our dividend program, and we returned $416 million to our shareholders by paying a dividend of $0.55 per share in the quarter. And importantly, we are investing in growth initiatives to build on the momentum that we are seeing across our business. In Q2, capital expenditures totaled $382 million. We continue to prioritize investments in our omnichannel capabilities as our customers are shopping more online.  \n Now turning to the income statement. In Q2, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.74 compared to $2.14 last year, an increase of 75%. In the quarter, there was a very modest impact on operating income related to the previously announced Canadian restructuring. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons, where applicable. \n In Q2, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.75, an increase of 74% compared to the prior year. These results surpassed our expectations due to higher-than-expected sales, gross margin rate and SG&A leverage as well as our strong execution to meet robust customer demand. Q2 sales were $27.3 billion, an increase of 34.2% on a comparable basis versus the prior year. This was driven by transaction growth of 22.6% and total average ticket growth of 11.6% as we saw strong repeat rates from new and existing customers.\n U.S. comp sales were up 35.1% in the quarter with truly broad-based strength across all geographies and across both DIY and Pro customers. Lowes.com sales growth remained robust, increasing 135% in the quarter. Given all of our previously announced investments in the product and service offerings for the Pro, we were particularly pleased to see mid-20% growth for the Pro customer in Q2.\n Our U.S. monthly comps were strong throughout the quarter with 41.5% in May, 34.4% in June and 28.2% in July. It's important to note that we delivered these strong comps despite significantly reducing promotions during the quarter. Throughout the quarter, we saw strong COVID-related demand, driven by customers working on incremental projects to make their homes as safe and as functional as possible. It's clear that homes have become multifunctional spaces for many families, a place for work, for school and for residence. We've also seen wallet share shift away from other forms of discretionary spending, shifting into home repair and maintenance work. \n Our sales also benefited from excellent execution and strong service levels across our stores in response to this unprecedented demand. Of note, sales trends remained strong in areas of the country where COVID-19 had been resurging. In August, we've continued to see the strong broad-based sales trend that we experienced in July with strength across both DIY and Pro customers. Month-to-date, August U.S. comp sales trends are materially consistent with July's performance levels. \n Gross margin was 34.1% of sales in the second quarter, an increase of 197 basis points compared to the second quarter of '19. Gross margin rate improved 137 basis points, driven by benefits from our improved pricing and promotional strategies. Favorable product mix also drove approximately 60 basis points of benefit. \n SG&A was 18.4% of sales in Q2, a 90 basis point improvement over LY. The company delivered a substantial improvement in operating leverage despite $430 million of COVID-related expenses. These investments included $260 million in financial assistance for our frontline associates, approximately $75 million related to cleaning and other safety-related programs and approximately $95 million in charitable contributions.  \n While $430 million of COVID-related expenses negatively impacted SG&A leverage by 157 basis points, this was more than offset by: payroll leverage of 110 basis points related to higher sales volume and improved store operating efficiencies; advertising leverage of 35 basis points; employee insurance leverage of 40 basis points; and occupancy leverage of 40 basis points. Adjusted operating income margin increased 311 basis points to 14.5% of sales, driven both by robust sales and improved operating efficiencies. \n The effective tax rate of 24.4% was in line with our expectations and consistent with the prior year. At $13.8 billion, inventory was essentially flat compared to the prior year levels as the supply chain worked to meet elevated customer demand throughout the quarter.  \n Now before I close, let me address our 2020 business outlook. As I indicated last quarter, we have suspended our guidance. In this unprecedented operating environment, we, like many other companies, have limited visibility into the future business trends, which result in an unusually wide range of potential outcomes for our financial performance. Having said that, I'd like to provide some perspective on the second half of the year. \n First, we expect that our top line growth will moderate somewhat from Q2 levels, although demand is still expected to remain strong as consumers continue to invest in their homes. Further, we expect that our improved product offerings and customer service will allow us to retain new Pro and DIY customers. Now keep in mind that both the third and fourth quarters are typically smaller revenue quarters, given the natural demand patterns of the home improvement sector.  \n For the remainder of the year, we expect that promotional activity will increase modestly but will not return to the prior year levels. We will also be lapping harder prior year comparisons as our sequential gross margin performance improved as we moved through 2019. As such, we expect lower levels of gross margin expansion in the second half of 2020 relative to the second quarter.  \n Turning to expenses. We anticipate that we will incur COVID-related operating expenses of approximately $70 million to $80 million per quarter to support safety and cleanliness in our stores. And importantly, we are making significant investments in our business to support the long-term growth and enhanced returns. Some of these investments include merchandising resets and expansion of our supply chain infrastructure. In the back half of this year, many of these projects are weighted more heavily towards expense rather than capital. Based on all of these factors, we anticipate that operating income margin flow-through will moderate in the second half versus the first half. We're still planning for approximately $1.6 billion in CapEx for the year with a continued focus on omnichannel investments.\n In closing, we are operating in a robust sector with strong underlying demand trends. We are investing in our business to further our capabilities, so we can continue to disproportionately capitalize on these trends. We have a strong balance sheet, and we remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation program, which should lead to long-term shareholder value creation. \n So with that, I thank you. We're now ready for questions. Chris, this is Dave. I think you're right. Obviously, we are very focused on delivering upon that 12% operating margin target. And keep in mind, that's just a step function. That's not the end. We think we can do better than that over time. It's clear at this point in time, we're trending a bit ahead of that, given just how our business is performing. But having said that, we still have a lot of investments that we're making to be sure that we can consistently deliver that 12% day in and day out. \n I think you heard us talk about this morning that we're investing in assortment and merchandise in the store environment. We're making really important strategic investments in our online capabilities and technology platform as well as in our supply chain. And we continue to focus in those areas to make sure that we can consistently deliver both really strong top line performance, manage gross margin at a reasonable rate, leverage SG&A in a meaningful way, so we can deliver that off-base target over time. I don't know that there's anything materially that's changed there. Clearly, 2019, we had a bit of a step down in gross margin. Our objective in 2020 and beyond was to get our margin rate back. Keep in mind that we are making investments in supply chain that will disproportionately dampen gross margin rate but will allow us to lever SG&A more productively over time. So you have some natural kind of geography shift within the P&L, Simeon. And Michael, as it relates to pros, I'll ask Bill to comment here a bit as well. But clearly, as we cycle in the back half of the year, we do think promotions will tick up just a little bit. I don't think it will be a material change. But I think it is important that we communicate really the value that we're offering to both consumers and the pros, the breadth of offering that we have at Lowe's. And I think because of that, you'll see just a slight tick-up, but I don't think a material change from a commercial cadence perspective. I'll ask Bill to... Yes. Chuck, Dave here. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of opportunity here. Part of what we're doing is investing in our infrastructure such that our base can become a lot more productive day in and day out. And you heard Joe speak about all the investments we're making from a technology perspective within the store environment such that we can really leverage the hours that we have in our stores to put more of those hours to work facing customers and actually driving increased sales and productivity as we move volume through the box. So I think there's a big opportunity. You'll see us continue to talk about it and push on it. And actually, even leveraging the omnichannel environment will also help that. Because if we engage consumers both in the store and online, it really helps us leverage those fixed costs across our platform. Steven, just keep in mind that what we have done here is consistent with our long-term plan because we were always in the mode of investing in the supply chain that we knew would drive incremental costs and dampen gross margin rate but would alleviate some SG&A pressure in the stores and across our platform. So I think the plan over the long term is consistent with that. Clearly, when you make investments in the short term, you have to stand up the facilities in advance for them being at full productivity level, so there will be some near-term headwinds. And that's somewhat of the commentary you heard me speak about as you thought about the back half of 2020 is really due to that fact. Listen, I don't think so. Listen, I think we've seen really strong growth and retention of both new and repeat customers in our channel, both from a Pro perspective and DIY. I think just practically speaking, we're going into kind of the season which demand begins to moderate just from a natural progression perspective. And I think that's just what we're trying to call out as you think about the back half of the year. I think we're really nicely positioned from a merchandising perspective and from a labor perspective that we're going to really do well from a service perspective and have the right product in stores and online to meet the demand for these customers. No. We have not. I think actually where COVID has picked up, we've seen very strong demand in those markets. And it's been pretty consistent, so we really have not seen a material change in there. We have not actually seen our business in those areas actually improve."

            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Marvin mentioned, we posted U.S. home improvement comparable sales growth of 35.1% in the second quarter, driven by broad-based outperformance across DIY and Pro customers as well as indoor and outdoor product categories. We delivered indoor comps of 30%, driven by strength in indoor categories, such as decor and lighting. We delivered strong growth across all merchandising departments. In fact, all 15 merchandising departments generated positive comps exceeding 20%.\n As customers continue to spend more time at home this quarter, we saw an acceleration in both indoor and outdoor project activity, including core repair and maintenance, along with projects to repurpose home space for work and study as well as discretionary indoor and outdoor projects to increase customers' enjoyment of their homes. We also continued to see robust COVID-related demand for essential cleaning products along with other home necessities such as appliances.  \n During the quarter, we posted comps over 30% in core project categories, such as lumber, tools and paint, driven largely by extensive indoor and outdoor project activity from both the DIY and Pro customer. Importantly, we saw significant improvement in installation-heavy categories, such as flooring, millwork and kitchen and bath. In paint, we continued to drive strong sales of both interior and exterior paint and stains as well as applicators as our brand offering and service model positioned us to serve increased project demand with our paint products being key components of many home improvement projects.  \n Lumber benefited from strong unit demand from both Pro and DIY customers as well as our investments in job lot quantities. And in tools, we saw strength across all segments of power tools, along with growth in tool storage and mechanics tools, driven by the CRAFTSMAN brand as customers took to doing projects at home. Our lawn and garden and seasonal and outdoor living teams also delivered comps above company average this quarter, driven by seasonal demand and customers focused on enjoying their outdoor space.  \n Our strong execution and powerful brand assortment allowed us to meet the elevated demand with brands such as Weber and Char-Broil, the top 2 brands in outdoor grilling, and an outstanding outdoor power equipment lineup featuring John Deere, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Honda and the Ariens brands. And today, I'm particularly excited that we are building on our industry-leading portfolio of outdoor power brands with EGO, which is the #1 brand in battery-powered outdoor power equipment. Lowe's is already the #1 destination in outdoor power equipment. And the addition of the EGO brand to our arsenal now only reinforces that leading position.  \n Beginning in December of 2020, Lowe's will be the exclusive nationwide home center to offer EGO's innovative battery-powered mowers, trimmers, chainsaws and blowers. In addition, Lowe's will begin offering select skilled battery-powered outdoor power equipment in late 2020, which includes mowers, leaf blowers and trimmers. The addition of the EGO brand furthers our commitment to expanding our assortment of sustainable products. EGO's battery-powered equipment is capable of matching or exceeding the performance of conventional gas items, which supports our corporate sustainability efforts.  \n In hardware, we continue to expand our Pro brand offering with the national launch of Simpson Strong-Tie framing hardware and fasteners this quarter in conjunction with the Just For Pros customer acquisition event. This product offering meets a critical need for the Pro in building out their projects, so we're now able to further extend our relationship with the Pro customer by helping them fulfill all their hardware needs in one place.  \n And as Marvin mentioned, we are pleased to see higher-than-expected online sales this quarter, along with a significant increase in downloads of our mobile app as well as improved customer ratings. We have also continued to enhance our omnichannel capabilities in the store with the launch of mobile check-in for curbside pickup that occurred in early July. This is also that customers can now let us know when they're on their way and when they've arrived at the store to pick up their order. And we added an internal order picking app to improve our associates' speed and accuracy in fulfilling these orders.  \n We are also focused on other extensions of our omnichannel capabilities. With our transition of Lowes.com to the cloud now fully complete, the teams are working quickly to accelerate the front-end work and deliver improved customer-facing capabilities in the second half of this year, such as online delivery scheduling, online order tracking, a dynamic customized homepage, simplified search and navigation and an expanded online product offering to further enhance the customer experience and to continue to grow sales.  \n As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we're excited to build on our retail fundamentals foundation. Consistent with our long-term plans, we are continuing with our merchandising investment in our stores with resets to address our product adjacencies that make it easier for the customer to shop, all with a focus on the Pro. This work will be done throughout the back half of the year. And we expect to touch the majority of our stores by the end of the fiscal year. And as we plan for the holiday season, when customers are expected to stay closer to home this year with a keen focus on home improvement projects, we are prepared and committed to serve their needs for fall preparation projects, remodel activity, space conversion projects, holiday decorating and gifting, along with core repair and maintenance activity.  \n In closing, I'd be remiss if I didn't again express our appreciation for our vendor partners, who again went above and beyond to help keep our shelves stocked despite facing unprecedented demand and their own operational challenges related to COVID-19. Across building products, home decor and our hard lines businesses, there were a number of standout performances again this quarter.\n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Dave. Yes. Just to -- Michael, just to add on what Dave was saying, I think we've clearly got to realize that gift centers and the holiday trim and tree programs were all committed for and bought prior to COVID happening. And so those were well in motion and on the way. And those are things that we have to work our way through based on how the consumer responds to those programs. But I think it's also important to clarify that during the quarter and during the first half of this year, we were dramatically less promotional all around building around our pricing and promo strategy that we've been working to put in place over the last 20 months, which has been a focus on everyday values and being priced right every day for our customer. And so really pleased with the traction that we're making with the teams. And I think as we look at the back half, it's not like we're going to go from one side of the road to the other and just get back into the promotional game. Yes. I think it's important to note that during the quarter, all 15 departments grew at or above double-digit rates for dot-com. All -- and the migration to the cloud, obviously, allowed for speed, allowed for us to be nimble. But we've got improved checkout and navigation continuing to happen as we go through the back half. We've continued to work on separating freight from costs. And if you remember our comments on this before, this will help make sure that competitive pricing shows up online the way it needs to show up online, continue to enhance our curbside pickup, working with Joe's team in store, continuing to improve our buy online, pick up in store process to make that store picking faster. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the store picking app, that's all around designing for the associate to be able to handle the customer with speed. So we've got a lot of efforts going in addition to adding SKUs and improving the content that we put out there on dot-com on a daily and weekly basis. Yes. I think to play off of Marvin's comments, as we shift to the fall business, it naturally shifts indoor. But in the southern parts of the country, there's still a lot of outdoor projects that get done as the weather cools. But for the northern markets, the Pro moves inside, the consumer moves inside, flooring, kitchens, bath, those types of projects, all about getting the home ready for the holidays is where the customers focus. And then you have your natural fall businesses, right? So fall businesses continue to play. Those are a little less seasonal than the spring time frame. And they're all really driven based on what Mother Nature brings. So that's really what drives the back half of the year."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. Over the past 18 months, we've been steadily improving our store operating efficiency and customer service. And we remained laser-focused on supporting a safe store environment through a data-driven approach based on an analysis of store traffic trends across our portfolio.  \n As I previously indicated, we implemented numerous safety standards in the first quarter in support of social distancing and enhanced sanitizing and cleaning. We executed these standards in a consistent, uniform manner across our stores in the U.S. and Canada to protect the health and safety of our team members and the communities we serve. These standards included removing product to free up space for our customer, adding signage and floor markings and adding social distancing ambassadors and leveraging technology to monitor store traffic, which help store managers limit customers based on the footprint, in line with the regulatory requirements.  \n In the second quarter, we added further safety measures by requiring all frontline associates to wear masks beginning in early May and by adopting a nationwide standard for all customers to wear masks in mid-July. In support of this standard, we are providing free masks for customers who need them. And our customers' appreciation for these efforts was evident in a significant increase in our brand reputation and engagement scores as we shifted our marketing away from promotional messaging and instead focused on our commitment to our communities.  \n I'm also pleased that we delivered strong customer service for both Pro and DIY customers in the second quarter while maintaining rigorous safety requirements and driving 35% U.S. sales comps. This is a testament to the outstanding work of our frontline associates and our commitment to our customers and communities. The health and safety of our associates and customers has always been and will remain our highest priority. \n Our strong results this quarter would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of our frontline associates, and we continue to recognize these efforts with incremental financial assistance. We announced 2 bonuses for July and August, which totaled $230 million. Full-time associates are receiving $300 and part-time and seasonal associates are receiving $150 in each payout. In fact, each payout was grossed up for taxes, so the company covered the incremental taxes as well. Combined with the support provided earlier in the year, we have now invested $560 million in COVID-related financial support for our frontline associates.  \n And in addition, I'm really pleased to announce that 100% of our stores earned a record \"Winning Together\" profit-sharing bonus this quarter totaling $107 million. Based on better-than-expected store performance, this represents an incremental $35 million payout to our frontline associates, above the target payment level. And we supported our communities by hiring over 100,000 associates for the spring. We are converting these seasonal associates to permanent positions at a much higher rate than in past years, which will help us meet the strong demand that we're continuing to see across our stores. In addition, each of these associates received telemedicine benefits for themselves and their families, even if they were not enrolled in Lowe's benefits program.  \n I'd like to now spend a few moments discussing our initiatives in support of our Pro customer. When the pandemic hit, we recognized that we needed to step up our efforts to keep pros working. On June 1, we launched JobSIGHT for Pros in partnership with Streem. This is a free, augmented video chat service that allows pros to conduct virtual home visits with their clients without entering their homes, which opens up their job opportunities. This is just another example of how we're innovating to leapfrog our competition.  \n And to further support their job pipeline, we recently announced a partnership with HomeAdvisor for our Pro loyalty customers. These customers will receive a free 1-year subscription to HomeAdvisor and a credit for an average of 10 free job leads as well as access to webinars hosted by industry experts on how to grow their business. Our Pro customers know that we've got their back and are committed to help keep them working, particularly in these uncertain times.  \n And today, we are thrilled to announce a significant step in the expansion of our product and service offering for the Pro. We are beginning a multiyear national rollout of Lowe's tool rental program with the grand opening of our first location at our Central Charlotte store next week. As over 70% of pros are currently utilizing tool rental programs, this will provide a meaningful opportunity for Lowe's to deepen our relationship with this customer segment. After a successful pilot, we are launching this program nationwide with a broad product assortment, a fully equipped mechanic shop, a large store footprint and importantly, intuitive customer-facing technology that creates a fast, frictionless process for this time-pressed customer. I look forward to updating you on our progress against this important initiative on future calls.\n Turning to our services business. Installed sales delivered positive comps in Q2 with the results improving as we moved through the quarter as customers began to feel more comfortable allowing contractors back in their homes. And from a store technology perspective, we've also completed the rollout of our intuitive touchscreen point-of-sale system and checkout across all stores. This new interface dramatically reduces associate training time as compared to the cumbersome green screens and multiple interfaces that they were previously using and also improves the customer experience through a shorter checkout process.  \n We also completed the launch of mobile printing across our store portfolio and installed digital signs in our appliance department. These initiatives reflect our ongoing efforts to modernize our store environment while giving our store associates more time in the aisles to serve our customers and move us further towards our goal of allocating 60% of their time to customer service and 40% to completing tasks.  \n In closing, I'd like to reiterate my appreciation for our frontline associates and their continued hard work and commitment to safety in serving customers. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Bill. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Thanks for the question, Mike. Our strong Pro demand with comps in the mid-20s continues. And it's really around our -- the investments that we've been making in both the product and the service offerings. So it's things like our job lot quantities, our dedicated supervisors, our Pro parking, our loaders, et cetera, et cetera. And as we now move to the more strategic phase of our Pro growth initiatives, what we're really excited about the progress we're making, things like our Pro loyalty platform that's integrated with CRM, keeping Pros working through the partnerships that I've announced at HomeAdvisor and JobSIGHT, really excited about our announcement of the tool rental. And so as these Pro customers continue coming back, seeing new product additions like Simpson Strong-Tie, and so we feel very good about the future of our Pro business. Yes. Thanks, Scot. So we've made significant progress. We're ahead of our 60-40 goal. We continue to engineer out tasking in the stores to improve customer service. We are well on our way and ahead of our 60-40 goal."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Lowe's Companies First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Dave Denton, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2020. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. \n Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in this morning's press release and on our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Good morning, everyone. This is an unprecedented time as we all navigate the ongoing global economic, social and health impacts of COVID-19. I'd like to start out by extending my best wishes for the health and safety to you and to your families. \n Like most retailers, we began the first quarter focused on meeting our internal financial plan, while executing our Q1 retail strategy. However, due to the global health crisis caused by COVID-19, everything changed in late February, and we immediately pivoted by establishing a cross-functional COVID-19 task force, opening a company-wide command center and reprioritizing our Q1 objectives. \n As a company, our focus shifted from running a business to achieve our financial plan to functioning as an essential retailer, operating in a pandemic with 3 key priorities: first, creating a safe store environment for our associates and our customers; second, providing support for our community, including health care providers and first responders; and third, financially supporting our associates during this unprecedented time. As a result of these new priorities, in the first quarter, we invested $340 million to support our associates, health care workers, first responders and community. In addition, we've committed $50 million of charitable contribution for our communities to do our part in this time of need. \n I'd like to begin by highlighting a few of the operational actions that we took in response to COVID-19, and later in the call, Joe will provide more details on these efforts. In early March, we shortened our store operating hours by closing 3 hours earlier each day at 7 p.m., so we could increase third-party cleaning routines and restock shelves. During the hours that our stores were open, we implemented several operational changes to ensure the safety of our associates and our customers. Including the garden centers, our stores average 144,000 square feet of space. To develop our social distancing safety procedures, our team took a strategic data-driven approach, tracking historical customer traffic patterns and identifying areas where customers tend to congregate. Based on this analysis, we implemented additional safety and social distancing protocols in 3 distinct areas: point-of-sale checkout; outside garden; and the paint desk. Our store team was so effective at implementing and executing the enhanced safety guidelines that our customer service scores improved 200 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter. This is truly an incredible accomplishment and a reflection of our commitment to customer service, even in this unprecedented environment. \n Also to provide our valued associates with a much deserved day off to spend with their families and their loved ones, we closed all stores and distribution centers on Easter Sunday. This decision negatively impacted sales and operating income, but it was absolutely the right thing to do for our associates. \n We have a unique and resilient business model that operates well when our communities need us most. Whether it's a hurricane, flood, tornado or a global health crisis, we are committed to being there for our customers. And I am pleased that over the past 18 months, we've established the agility to provide our customers with the essential products they need to keep their home safe and functional and their businesses running. \n None of our success in the first quarter would have been possible without the outstanding commitment of our store associates working under unprecedented conditions. Our field leaders also distinguished themselves during the quarter. Division Presidents, regional Vice Presidents, district managers and field merchants abandoned their normal routines and spent time each week visiting stores to provide leadership support and guidance for our store managers and frontline leaders. As someone who started out their retail career as a $4.35 an hour part-time store associate, I understand the importance of seeing the leaders of the company out on the front lines during a crisis. \n Let me now turn to our first quarter results, which reflect the benefits of our retail fundamental strategy, the improvement in our overall execution and the strength of our home improvement business model. For the first quarter, we delivered strong sales growth, with total company comp sales growing 11.2%. Our U.S. home improvement comp was 12.3% due to strong demand from both DIY and Pro customers. Overall demand strengthened as we moved through the quarter, and net sales momentum has continued into the month of May. \n For the quarter, DIY comp slightly outpaced Pro comp, and the uptick in DIY demand was partly driven by the arrival of spring weather in many Western and Southern geographies, as well as a customer mindset that was heavily concentrated on the home. We saw broad-based project activity, ranging from outdoor landscaping and other beautification projects to essential indoor, repair and maintenance work and long deferred home projects, the to-do list that customers hadn't previously tackled given their busy schedule. \n Comp sales for Pro was strong, supported by our focus on retail fundamentals, including job lot quantities, more flexible delivery and the improved service model that we put in place in 2019. And as you would expect, we saw increased demand in COVID-related products, such as cleaning supplies and appliances, like refrigerators and freezer. Partly offsetting these gains was softness in heavy indoor installation categories, such as kitchen and bath, as customers were reluctant to invite people into their homes. In total, we estimate that the net impact of COVID-related sales contributed approximately 850 basis points to our total company comp growth, which includes 80 basis points of cleaning product, 70 basis points of refrigerator and freezer sales and 700 basis points in acceleration of projects primarily for the DIY customer. \n As we move through the quarter, there was also a sharp uptick in sales on Lowes.com, as customers began to shop more and more online. Our investments in online infrastructure and progress to date with the Google Cloud migration greatly improved site stability and allowed us to effectively handle the increased traffic. For the quarter, Lowes.com sales were up 80% overall, with even stronger growth rates for our Pro customers. Online penetration increased to 8% of total sales. \n From a geographic perspective, we had broad-based growth with positive comps in all 15 geographic regions and all 3 U.S. divisions. Regions that outperformed the total company comps were Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Nashville, Los Angeles, St. Louis and Seattle. And once again, the West was our top-performing geographic division. The geographic footprint of our stores in the U.S. also played a role in our strong sales performance in Q1. \n The COVID-19 crisis created less disruption in rural areas of the country where approximately 1/4 of our store base is located. Our rural stores outperformed the company comp in Q1 by over 250 basis points. Conversely, on average, our urban stores experienced more demand disruption from the COVID-19 crisis. Approximately 10% of our U.S. store base is classified as urban. This subset of stores underperformed the company comp by more than 400 basis points. \n In Canada, we posted negative comp sales as performance was adversely impacted by store closures and other regulatory-related operating restriction. We have initiatives in place to improve performance and remain confident in the long-term potential of our Canadian business. \n During the quarter, we shifted our marketing efforts by dramatically limiting our promotional messaging and instead highlighting our commitment to our communities and our appreciation for our frontline associates. In fact, as the presenting sponsor on ESPN for the NFL Draft, which posted record-setting viewership, we ran a campaign to spotlight and thank our associates and how they support their communities and the first responders in a time of crisis. Although actions like closing on Easter, reducing promotions, closing stores 3 hours early each day and limiting customer access to key areas, like paint and garden, limited our sales in the quarter, they are a reflection of our culture and to the fundamental commitment to the safety of our associates and our customers. \n Our Q1 results also showed that while consumers were sheltering in place this quarter, they had an opportunity to rediscover Lowe's, both in-store and online. And the improvements we made in our business over the last 18 months allowed us to meet the customer demand. \n I'm also pleased that during this time of high levels of unemployment in our country, Lowe's has hired over 100,000 store associates for the spring season. In addition, to assist other retails and operating safely in this exceptionally challenging environment, we shared our best practices with the Retail Industry Leaders Association. In fact, the only competitive threat we're focused on right now is the COVID-19 virus. \n Although our current and future environment is unpredictable, I am confident in our ability to execute and continue to provide the essential products and services that our communities need. And in closing, I am tremendously proud of our associates and would like to again express my heartfelt appreciation for their hard work and their dedication. And I also want to thank our vendor partners for their great efforts to step up to the challenges that this pandemic had presented. \n And with that, I will turn the call over to Joe to discuss the actions that we've taken to support our customers, operate effectively and keep our associates safe. \nDavid Denton: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by echoing Marvin's appreciation for the tremendous work that our associates have done during this crisis across our stores and distribution network. As always, our highest priority is the health and safety of our associates and customers. \n I'll now take a moment to review the operational changes that we implemented this quarter in response to COVID-19. We began with an immediate assessment of how to best facilitate social distancing in our operations and then quickly acted to implement the following: additional signage and floor markers; adding social distancing ambassadors to manage customer traffic flow; leveraging new technology available on handheld smart devices to monitor store traffic, helping store managers limit customers based on the store footprint, in line with regulatory requirements; and we're moving product from our stores to help free up additional space for our customers, especially in high-traffic areas. \n As Marvin mentioned, on average, our stores are 144,000 square feet in size, including the garden center. Therefore, we also deployed a data-driven process to implement additional safety measures in areas where customers tend to congregate, such as our point-of-sale registers, the garden center and the paint desk. For example, in our garden centers, we utilized our Merchandising Services Teams, or MSTs, to remove shelving in product to encourage customers to spread out. And at the garden center entrance, we set up one-way traffic flows and limited the number of customers entering at any one time. \n To ensure a clean, safe operating environment, we implemented more stringent cleaning procedures, added more hours for our third-party cleaning service and closed our stores 3 hours early at 7 p.m. to allow for increased cleaning and restocking activities. We also determined that keeping our stores open until 7 p.m. allowed for enough operating hours during the day to minimize concentration of customer traffic. \n Lowe's is one of the first retailers to install Plexiglass shields at the point-of-sale areas in all stores. We also distributed gloves and masks to our associates to wear during their shifts. \n As a reflection of our commitment to our associates, we provided them with additional financial assistance totaling $290 million in incremental investment in the first quarter. We made 2 special payments to hourly associates to help with unexpected expenses, one in March and one in May, with each payment consisting of $300 for full time and $150 for part time and seasonal associates. And for the month of April, we instituted a temporary wage increase of $2 per hour for all hourly associates. \n To further protect the health of our associates and those around them, we offered 14 days of emergency paid leave for all associates who needed it. And for those at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, we offered emergency paid leave of up to 4 weeks. And to show our support to our dedicated frontline managers, we have provided them with an additional 2 weeks of paid vacation to recharge and spend time with their families. We also extended telemedicine services to all associates and their families, whether or not they were enrolled in Lowe's medical plans. \n And to do our part in protecting frontline medical workers and first responders, we committed $50 million of support to our communities this year, including approximately $10 million worth of essential protective products, including N95 masks. \n And as online demand increased, smart devices allowed associates to go buy online, pick up in store and parcel shipping orders more efficiently. In fact, this quarter, we rolled out curbside pickup in a matter of days. This rapid response would not have been possible without the technology we deployed in 2019. \n Our new customer-centric scheduling system and scheduling effectiveness tools also allowed us to monitor store traffic versus associate availability and deliver customized, tiered sets of priorities for stores based on their capacity level. \n As we look forward, we remain committed to our retail fundamental strategy and investing for future growth. \n In closing, I'm incredibly proud of how our associates responded and adapted to this challenging environment. They serve our customers and communities in a time of tremendous need, and we remain committed to supporting them as our most valuable asset. I'm really pleased to announce that 100% of our stores earned the Winning Together profit sharing bonuses this quarter totaling $87 million. Based on stronger-than-expected store performance, this represents an incremental $24 million payment to our frontline associates, above the target payment level. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Marvin mentioned, we posted U.S. home improvement comparable sales growth of 12.3% in the first quarter driven by outperformance in essential DIY and Pro categories. 14 of 15 merchandising departments generated positive comps, with weakness limited to installation heavy product in kitchens and bath. We saw very strong COVID-related demand for essential cleaning products, along with other home necessities, such as refrigerators, freezers and DIY home repair products. \n As customers isolated in their homes this quarter, they engaged in a variety of projects, which drove double-digit comps in core spring-related categories, paint and other critical repair and maintenance categories. During the quarter, we posted double-digit comps in lumber, which benefited from strong unit demand from both Pro and DIY customers, but continues to be driven by our improved investments in job lot quantities. \n Core Pro categories also performed well, with double-digit comps in rough plumbing, hardware and tools. Within rough plumbing, we delivered double-digit growth in pipe and fittings, as our expansion of job lot quantities in this area continues to pay off, along with growth in other essential categories, like air filtration, pumps and water filtration. \n Our hardware business benefited from the strength in fasteners and our general hardware categories, supported by the addition of Pro brands, like FastenMaster, GRK and Power Pro One, as these product categories are the critical project completers for both the Pro and the DIY customer. \n In tools, we continue to see a strong customer response to our CRAFTSMAN program, but we also saw strength from the launch of our new Kobalt XTR 24-Volt power tool platform, as both the heavy DIY and Pro customer are quickly recognizing the quality and performance of this great product. \n Within our key Pro tool brands, such as Dewalt, the #1 power tool brand in the industry, we continue to see nice growth across all segments, and we are pleased with the results we are seeing through the addition of our exclusive Dewalt 12-volt compact line of power tools. \n Lastly, we continue to showcase new and innovative tool products from Bosch, Lufkin, Spyder and Metabo HPT, along with Kobalt to build on the strength of our tools business. These brands, combined with our investment in job lot quantities and our improved Pro service model, are driving new customer trial and increasing our share of wallet with our existing Pro customers. \n As Marvin and Joe indicated, the progress we made on our strategic initiatives in 2019 positioned us to execute well this quarter. For example, having our merchants in place for the entire year allowed us to fully plan for the spring season and respond to the rapidly changing operating requirements we are currently facing. I'm also proud of our vendor partnerships and our recent brand introductions, both of which have allowed us to better meet the customer demand. I'd like to take a moment to mention just a few of the suppliers who made an extraordinary effort to keep our stores well stocked this quarter, despite their own challenging operating environments. \n Within our building products categories, some of our suppliers that deserve a special shout-out are Charlotte Pipe, ECMD, SharkBite and Idaho Forest Group. In home decor, 3M, [ monop ] and Samsung were true standouts. And in our hard lines business, Hillman, Bonnie, Oldcastle and MTD products went above and beyond in their responsiveness. \n And finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a big thank you to the efforts put forth by ZEP cleaning products, Safety Zone and Medline, as these 3 suppliers went above and beyond to provide us with hand sanitizer and gloves for our frontline associates. \n Turning back to our associates. Our field merchandising teams played a critical role in helping our stores adjust to the changing environment, along with being on the ground to respond to 10 tornadoes and 2 earthquakes that impacted parts of the U.S. during the quarter. And our Merchandising Service Team, or MST, also went above and beyond as they were ready to do whatever was needed during the quarter to help our stores respond to significant increases in demand. This quarter, our MSTs were key in our ability to quickly reconfigure our stores to support social distancing. The support of these teams is invaluable because they are the boots on the ground focused on taking the time-consuming tasks off the shoulders of our Red Vest associates. \n And looking ahead, we continue to make investments to drive future growth. And in the second quarter, we are excited about our rollout of Simpson Strong-Tie framing hardware and fasteners. These trusted Pro products will be available in stores nationwide, with an expanded assortment on Lowes.com, helping Pros to fulfill all their hardware needs in one place, saving them time and money. \n And as spring has now arrived across the country, we will continue to leverage our position as the #1 destination for outdoor power equipment in the U.S., with our leading brands, such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Ariens and CRAFTSMAN, to provide customers with an outstanding selection of products to help them complete their outdoor projects. At the same time, we're proud to offer our customers the top 2 brands in grilling, Weber and Char-Broil. \n As we've discussed previously, we remain focused on completing our Google Cloud migration in the second quarter to ensure that we build a strong infrastructure for Lowes.com. And the teams are working quickly to add capabilities to Lowes.com over the next 3 quarters that will further enhance the customer experience and to continue to grow sales on this digital platform. \n In closing, we remain committed to the work ahead to serve our customers and our communities as they navigate the public health challenge of COVID-19, while building capabilities to serve them even better in the future. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Dave. \nDavid Denton: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin this morning by reviewing the liquidity actions that we took during the quarter and provide an update on our capital allocation priorities. Given the uncertain economic outlook, we decided to bolster our liquidity to plan for any unforeseen disruptions. \n In Q1, we raised $4 billion in senior notes and increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility by $770 million. After repaying $500 million of senior notes due in April of 2020, we now have $6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as well as $3 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, which can be made available for any unanticipated needs and liquidity. We believe that we have more than adequate liquidity to manage through any of the potential scenarios that we could be facing. \n During the quarter, we also decided to halt our share repurchases program. Furthermore, we do not anticipate doing any more share repurchases this year beyond what we executed in the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased 9.6 million shares for $947 million at an average price of $98.45 per share. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend program. And as always, we look for ways to drive shareholder value over the long term. \n Also consistent with our capital allocation framework, we are continuing to prioritize investments in the business for future growth. In the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $328 million, and we are still planning for a total of $1.6 billion in capital expenditures through this year. In certain cases, we have reprioritized some capital projects to focus on the near-term need to improve our omnichannel capabilities, but our expectations for the total spend in 2020 remains unchanged. \n I'll now turn to a review of our operating performance, beginning with the income statement. In Q1, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.76 per share compared to $1.31 in the first quarter of LY, an increase of 35%. In the quarter, there was a very modest impact on operating income related to the previously announced Canadian restructuring. \n My comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. In Q1, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.77, an increase of 45% compared to the prior year. These results exceeded expectations largely due to stronger-than-expected sales and gross margin rate, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. Sales for the first quarter were $19.7 billion, an increase of 11.2% on a comparable basis versus the prior year period, with total average ticket growth of 9.7%, while transactions grew by 1.2%. \n U.S. comp sales were up 12.3% in the quarter, and we were encouraged to see strength in our performance across both DIY and Pro customers and across all geographies. Our U.S. monthly comps increased as we moved through the quarter with 5.1% in February, 8.9% in March and 20.4% in April. February's financial performance was largely in line with our expectations. But beginning of March, we saw sales impacted by COVID-related prep activities and customers working on long delayed projects as they sheltered in place. \n Also Lowes.com sales ticked up meaningfully in March as more customers increasingly utilized online shopping options. Sales continued to accelerate into April with a large step-up mid-month. Lowes.com sales also increased significantly with comps of over 150% in the month, while our installed sales declined approximately 50% as many customers were unwilling to allow installation work in their homes. \n The strong broad-based trends that we saw in April have continued into May, with strength across both DIY and Pro and across nearly all merchandising categories and all geographies. For May month-to-date, U.S. comp sales have been trending at or above April results, with strong double-digit comps across all geographic regions. \n Gross margin was 33.1% of sales in the first quarter, an increase of 164 basis points compared to Q1 of LY. Gross margin rate improved 110 basis points driven both by the actions that we took last year to lower product cost and improve our pricing and promotional performance as well as a 40 basis point benefit from lower promotional activities throughout the quarter. \n As Marvin mentioned, the company pulled back on promotional marketing in an effort to limit nonessential traffic given the stay-at-home orders across the nation. Gross margin also benefited from approximately 55 basis points related to favorable product mix. \n SG&A for Q1 was 21.3% of sales, an improvement of 45 basis points over the prior year. This included $320 million of COVID-related expenses incurred during the quarter, with $275 million in financial assistance for our frontline associates, approximately $35 million related to cleaning and other pandemic-related operating expenses and approximately $10 million in charitable contributions. While the $320 million of COVID-related expenses resulted in SG&A deleverage of 160 basis points, the impact was more than offset by payroll leverage of 105 basis points driven by higher sales and improved store efficiencies, advertising leverage of 40 basis points and employee insurance leverage of 25 basis points. \n Adjusted operating income margin increased 208 basis points to 10.16% of sales. Note that COVID-related expenses are not excluded from our adjusted results. \n The effective tax rate was 25.1% compared to 16.6% last year. The prior year quarter benefited from a change in approach related to the exit of our Mexico operations. The adjusted effective tax rate was 25%, above the prior year rate of 22.9%. \n At $14.3 billion, inventory is slightly lower than the prior year levels. \n Now before I close, let me address our 2020 business outlook. Despite our solid performance this quarter and strong sales momentum continuing into May, we are withdrawing our prior guidance for the full year 2020 sales, operating income and earnings per share. In this unprecedented operating environment, we, like other companies, have limited visibility into future business trends, which result in an unusually wide range of potential outcomes for our 2020 financial performance. However, going forward, we would like to provide additional transparency regarding our performance, so it is my expectation that we'll be giving more frequent periodic updates on our results throughout the second quarter. \n In closing, we remain confident about the future of our business and our ability to continue to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value. By the way, I'd like to extend my appreciation to the associates at Lowe's across the world who have risen to meet the challenges of this global health crisis. \n Operator, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on sustainability of comps. I know it's an impossible question to really answer, and you're not going to provide much guidance. But from a planning perspective, right, there's a surge right now. Your inventory position looks pretty reasonable. So what are your expectations, if you could share how you're thinking about the surge and then leveling off? And then what should be a recession theoretically now and into the back half of the year? \nMarvin Ellison: Simeon, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part, then I'll let Dave take the second piece. You're right, this is a very unique and unprecedented environment that we're in. But what we can tell you is that we had very strong sales in April. And as Dave mentioned in his prepared comments, that momentum has continued into May. That includes a triple-digit comps in Lowes.com that also transitioned from April into May. We don't anticipate we're going to see negative comps, but we do anticipate that we're going to see sales start to moderate at some point in the latter part of this quarter and in the back half of the year. \n What's interesting about this environment is that this is not a housing recession. If you go back to 2008, 2009, you're in a housing recession, and so the home improvement business was directly impacted. This is obviously different. And we're seeing still sustained strength from our homeowners because they're sheltering in place, and they're finding those projects around the house. Having said that, like every other company out there, we have very limited visibility to what's going to happen in the out months and out quarters, but we do feel as though, even in this unprecedented environment, we have a really good execution plan. And we think the results in Q1 reflected that. So I'll let Dave add anything. \nDavid Denton: Yes. Simeon, I'd just add kind of a couple of points. One, real time, we're tactically responding and managing to the increased demands for consumers for these essential products that they're seeing in our stores. So one, real time, we're working on that. \n Secondly, importantly, we're still running our long-term playbook. We're making investments today to drive long-term shareholder value in the out year. So we have not deviated from that playbook. \n And three, we have developed a variety of, I guess, plans that can allow us to flex, both from a merchandising perspective to lean into more nondiscretionary-type items over the back half, if required; and secondly, being able -- with all the tools that we put in place operationally, to be able to flex our labor and operating expense profile to manage in a slightly softer demand environment. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then my follow-up, is there -- I doubt, with plus-20 type of comp, it sounds like that's what you're running. Anything in DIY, yellow flags? And it sounds like the Pro is also pacing the DIY customer at the moment. Can you talk about anything you're hearing as far as the type of jobs and if their pipeline or backlog is starting to refill up? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, I think what's interesting is the strength remains in DIY. But for us, the Pro customer remains healthy, and that customer has transitioned primarily to outside project. Also as a reminder, our Pro customer is the smaller, what we call it, a pickup truck Pro. That Pro was less impacted in this forced downturn than the larger, more industrial Pro. So even though Pro was not as robust as DIY, our Pro's growth was still really strong in the quarter, and that strength continues. And their pipeline is more delayed and not canceled, and now you're starting to see those jobs pick up. \n Another interesting data point is in the states that are beginning to reopen, we are seeing our stores outperform the total company comp in those locations, which, to us, is a data point, but it's a glimmer of hope that we're able to sustain our performance, even when there is a broader competitive landscape out there. \n But again, Simeon, there's a lot we don't know. There's a lot of uncertainty. But as Dave said, we have a lot of levers that we can pull from an expense management perspective. And Bill Boltz and Joe McFarland have really detailed playbooks from the 2008, 2009 period when we had to transition, in our old life, to a more repair and maintenance type of strategy. We know how to do that. So if that is a requirement, we have a very experienced team of merchants and operators that can make that pivot. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Marvin, I know you're not expecting negative comp, but should we look at that 850 basis points of COVID-related sales of simply pulling forward demand from future periods? And if that's the case, why wouldn't comps [ pulled forward ]? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, Mike, we don't see this as a pull-forward because these were projects that were on the customers' to-do list that they simply didn't have time to get to. I mean, as a reminder, I mean, we're in the essential retail business, and 2/3 of what we sell is nondiscretionary. And what we saw a lot is customers coming in and fixing things that they had just delayed. So we don't see it as a pull-forward at all. \n Look, we're blessed to be open. We're very thankful that we're open. But this is, without question, the most challenging environment that any of us have ever worked in. And when we look at what the customers are buying and we look at the sustainability of it, we don't see what occurred in Q1. We don't see what occurred in April as a pull-forward. We just see it as a unique demand shift based on the competitive landscape and based on customers sheltering in place. \nMichael Lasser: Understood. And then a quick 2-parter for Dave. First part is if we strip out the benefit in the gross margin we saw from favorable mix and from advertising less promotions, it looks like you still haven't recouped everything that you lost in the first quarter of last year. At what point will you be able to recoup everything that you lost in the gross margin? Or is it just going to be structurally lower? And your commentary around share repurchases indicated that you're not going to do it for this year. What happens if there's a V-shape recovery or the business continues to perform very well? Under what conditions would you resume the share repurchases? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Michael, listen, it's our expectation that we would recover by the end of the year our gross margin to the baseline rate that we talked about. That was our prior guidance. And we're largely working on that day in and day out. I'd say there's a combined team between really merchandise and finance focused against that effort. And I'm actually really pleased with the progress we made, and we continue to push forward. So I feel like we're in really good stead there. We're kind of making the right investments to improve our performance. \n And then secondly, from a share repurchase perspective, listen, we'll wait and see. I think the good news is, at the moment, our cash flow was very robust and really strong. We've shored up our balance sheet from a liquidity perspective. Let's just kind of watch and see just given the dynamic nature of this market and see where we stand. And we'll watch it carefully as we go through the balance of this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nSeth Sigman: I wanted to focus a little bit on SG&A. Obviously, very good leverage in the quarter. You discussed some incremental costs, obviously, but you had some offsets. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on some of those positive offsets in the quarter. How sustainable are those as you look into the second quarter? And then just regarding the $320 million of incremental cost, how should we be thinking about that bucket as well? \nMarvin Ellison: So Seth, I'll take the first part, and then I hand it over to Joe McFarland. I think that the key to our ability to have the leverage performance was the new scheduling and labor management system. Timing is everything, and our associates have been incredibly heroic during this time. But the ability to make sure we could look at the demands of the business by location, by department of the store to schedule effectively was in large parts. \n I'll let Joe McFarland talk about what we were able to benefit from the labor scheduling system, in addition to some other expense-related initiatives that they drove in operation. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Seth. This is Joe. So as we've been working on our 60-40, and again, that is to shift our labor productivity from tasking to selling, we are well on our way in our 60-40 transition. And so if you think about things that Marvin mentioned, the customer-centric schedule, we were able to really dial in our associate staffing based on departments that were lifting, reallocate labor in the areas of the store that were suffering. And also the smartphones, the ability for the associates to be able to sustain 150% comps in dot-com in the month of April and 80% for the quarter would not have been doable had we not done things, like our pick app, in the smartphone applications that really allow the associates to set up curbside delivery. \n And so, Seth, there are a number of things throughout the quarter, the operational initiatives that we continue to stay focused on, our centralized receiving. So a lot of things allowed us to gain that leverage. \nDavid Denton: Yes. And Seth, I'll just add, give a shout-out to all the ops team to really be very focused and really drive a lot of efficiencies this quarter. However, there will be additional cost that we will incur as the new operating model goes forward. We incurred cleaning -- incremental cost for cleaning. We're put in social distancing ambassadors in our stores to manage the queues and flow-through from a traffic perspective. So some of those costs, which we incurred about $35 million in the first quarter, are probably ongoing for the balance of this year. \nSeth Sigman: And what about the $275 million, how much of that is ongoing past the first quarter? \nMarvin Ellison: So Seth, I mean, our goal is to take care of our associates. I mean we're really proud that in Q1, we invested roughly $340 million in our associates and our customers and communities. We're going to continue to make sure that we take care of our associates as this pandemic continues to drive a unique environment in our stores. Like anything else, it's difficult for us to project when that's going to be. But as an example, we paid out $80 million in special payments in the month of March, $2 wage increase for hourly associates in the month of April, another $80-plus million in special payments for the month of May. Joe talked about the Winning Together payment that we're going to make over and above the target for the month of June. And so we've looked at the needs of our associate, and we'll make the appropriate decision based on what we think is in their best interest. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. Just to follow up here on that May quarter to date trend, are you seeing the composition of growth change at all between DIY and Pro? And are you seeing a pickup in some of those weaker installation heavy categories, like kitchen and bath? Any signs that those are starting to improve more as the restrictions are easing here? \nMarvin Ellison: So I'll take the first one and let Joe talk about the install piece. The short answer is yes. DIY remains very, very strong. Pro is improving. And remember what I said, because our Pro is that smaller pickup truck Pro, the desk Pro tends to be less impacted by macroeconomic factors. And so desk Pro was healthy, but they're getting even more healthy as the weeks and days progresses throughout the year. And as I mentioned, in states that are reopening, we see strength in our business, but we also see strength in these urban store locations. Remember, I mentioned in the first quarter, our remote stores dramatically outperformed urban stores by almost 650 basis points. We're starting to see those urban markets start to improve as well. And so as Dave mentioned, there's a broad geographic positive double-digit performance that we're seeing. \n And Joe can talk a little bit about the install piece. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. So from the install piece, Marvin mentioned that our install heavy related categories for the quarter were significantly down, as referenced in our negative comps in kitchen and bath. As we have progressed through the quarter and looked week by week, we have a really robust dashboard that we look at that includes things like future leads. And so on the exterior installation projects, we're really seeing that business come back very, very quickly. So we're very pleased there. We are making progress on the interior projects, but that will be slow, and that will be tempered as our consumers feel more and more comfortable allowing our Pros in their home, our installers in their home. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. \nGregory Melich: I have a follow-up for Dave and then on strategy, Marvin, I had one on that. Dave, just the $340 million that you did -- or $320 million on COVID, is any of that accrual that's something that, basically, you might get paid out later this year, like extra vacation? Or was that basically cost in the quarter? And then Martin, a follow-up. \nDavid Denton: It's largely cost in the quarter. There's always some accruals based on when things actually get paid. But largely, this is expenses that are incurred in Q1. \nGregory Melich: Perfect. And you would -- and it sounds like you're comfortable if the leverage ratio falls from 2.7 down to 2. If results are strong, you want us to be more conservative on the balance sheet. \nDavid Denton: That's correct. If you look at our leverage ratio as we sit today, we're probably a little bit over 2.8 at this point in time. But if you net the cash that we have on our balance sheet, we're well below that. And I think just given the unprecedented environment we're operating, we're just going to be conservative here for a while until we kind of see how this plays out for the balance of the year. \nGregory Melich: Makes total sense. And Marvin, you're talking about the digital surge and also how it's happening by geography and by even customer. Could you give us some more about the changes and improvements you're making in the multichannel experience and just any metrics around the customers that are using it that might be new or now behaving differently or more frequently since they use Lowes.com? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, what I can tell you, Greg, is that we're just pleased that the work that we put into stabilizing and modernizing Lowes.com is starting to pay dividends. As we mentioned in the last couple of calls back last year, the entire dot-com site was on a decade-old platform. And so we're in the process of transitioning that to Google Cloud, will be complete this quarter, but that allowed us to take on the demand. And what we're seeing is that customers simply want to shop the way that they choose to. And in the past, we couldn't accommodate that. Joe mentioned in his prepared comments, when we start to get request from customers for curbside, we put that up and going in 3 days. I mean this time last year, it would've been impossible to do that because we didn't have the infrastructure. \n Bill Boltz and the merchant team has also done a really nice job of adding additional SKUs, and I'll let Bill talk about some of the work the merchants have done that has allowed us to drive the dot-com business and some of the future work that we have in place to drive dot-com for the balance of the year. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. This is Bill. So just a lot of work from the online team as well as the core merchants to get relevant SKUs online, relevant categories of product, in addition to being able to support the operation work that goes on inside the store. But along that, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the capabilities that the team is continuing to work on to enhance delivery operations, to schedule deliveries, to be able to shift from many of our locations, all of that work continuing to go and to be put in place through the balance of the year. So just lots of improvement that will continue to go on Lowes.com. \nMarvin Ellison: And Greg, the other point I make, I mean, I would say, roughly 90% of our dot-com sales are fulfilled or picked up at a store. And for us, that's significant because anytime the customer can pick it up at a store, that helps us to defer the cost of operating that platform. The good news is Lowes.com will only get better for the balance of the year. And as I mentioned, we're triple-digit growth in April. We're triple-digit growth month-to-date, and we can sustain that. And we're having improved functionality for the customer each and every week, and that's something that we're excited about the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. \nEric Bosshard: Two things. First of all, in terms of online, the pickup in store, fulfilled at store, I know you said that fulfilled from the store, but how much of this is getting delivered in the mail? And how much of it is getting picked up at the store? Can you just give us what that number was in the quarter? \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. So Greg, it's Joe. So just over 60% of our orders are picked up in store, and then the incremental is fulfilled primarily through store. \nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then secondly, in terms of the promotion and merchandising strategy for 2Q, I guess, a question for Bill. The strategy around promotions and events for Memorial Day and Fourth of July, how are you planning on that? And then curious as you look back to how you manage the Spring Black Friday, the reduced effort to drive traffic, did you end up seeing -- or how material was the negative impact on sales from that and then bridge that to how you think about Memorial Day and July 4 as well? \nMarvin Ellison: Eric, this is Marvin. I'll take the Spring Black Friday, and I'll let Bill talk about Memorial Day and Q2. So when we look at Spring Black Friday, we received minimal incremental sales benefit from the event. Due to the distribution process of print media, we were unsuccessful in pulling the tap from distribution. But when we look at all other forms of media, all other traffic driving mechanisms for the event was pulled. So from that, the sales were minimal. And let me make sure, just for the broad audience, I define how we look at print media. Print is the least effective marketing medium that we have, and total sales contribution generated by print for Lowe's is 0.7%. So I know there was a lot of discussion that Spring Black Friday was a benefit to us in the quarter. But as I said, it was incrementally minimal at best. \n In addition to that, as you know, we closed for Easter. And we were forecasting Easter to be a plus-$200 million day. And when Dave Denton, Joe McFarland, Bill Boltz and I sat down and made that decision to close, we had no idea at that time how we would make the sales up. But we felt like it was in the best interest of our associates and their families to give them a day off, and we would just take the financial hit, for lack of a better term, for that decision. But we felt like that it was simply culturally the right thing to do. So when we take then close for Easter, when we take full in all other traffic driving mechanisms for Spring Black Friday, both events turned into a negative environment from a sales perspective for us. So that kind of summarizes Easter and Spring Black Friday. And looking in the rearview mirror, I'll let Bill talk about Q2. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Eric, in regards to the pricing strategy, as we've shared with you before, our intention has always been to change the pricing strategy at Lowe's and get to be more of an everyday competitive price program. And so that work really started a year ago. It continues into 2020. So as we look at Memorial Day, Memorial Day is going to be very consistent to how we operated in Q1. And as we get into the back half of Q2, with July 4 and Father's Day, we'll get, again, trying to implement the pieces and the place, the pricing strategy, more of a normal cadence from being relevant for dad and being relevant for the holiday on July 4. So that's how we're going to approach the quarter. \nMarvin Ellison: And Eric, the last point I'll make, and I think Dave will close the comment is, I mean, at the end of the day, we want to be a value-oriented retailer. But we don't want to be promotional. I think that's what just a point that Bill has said from his very first day here. So you may not see us using traffic driving media to get incremental footsteps in the store in this unique environment that we're operating in, but when the customers come in, we want them to see a value on the shelf because if there is a time that you ever needed a value for customers, this is one of those times. But we will be very cognizant and conscious of not driving traffic in an environment where that may put people at risk. And that's something that we're going to balance really well. \nDavid Denton: Yes. And to Marvin's point, obviously, we -- our stores, there's a lot of value in our stores, the items that we sell. And if you just look in the rearview mirror, you look at the number of items that we promoted this year versus the number of items that we sold on promotion last year, we're down about 24%. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I just wondered, with regards to customer acquisition, do you have an idea of how any newly acquired customers broke down between DIY and Pro during the first quarter? And have you seen repeat purchasing from these customers? \nMarvin Ellison: Kate, this is Marvin. That's a really good question. What I will tell you is that this was such a unique quarter, and we were so focused on, first and foremost, making sure that we were looking into the health and safety of our associates and our customers. That is not a dataset that we spend a ton of time looking at. Candidly, as I said in my prepared comments, the moment we started to address the challenges of COVID-19 for our associates and customers, we became less focused on the financial performance of the company, and we became more focused on trying to provide the essential products that our customers and communities needed. I'm sure we can get that data, and we can probably share. I'm sure Investor Relations team can get it for you, but we were just so focused on just trying to run this business, serve our customers, serve our communities and keep our associates safe. But there are a lot of datasets we didn't pay a lot of attention to this quarter. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And just as a follow-up and unrelated. I realize comps are very, very strong, but are you still seeing the stronger trends in the best -- the better and best categories versus the good categories? And have there any been -- any signs of trade-down by the Pro? \nMarvin Ellison: No. Average ticket remains strong. We have seen no trade-down. Our customer segment has been surprisingly resilient. And as I stated earlier, customers have rediscovered Lowe's. We know that for a fact. But again, patterns have been strong. They've been very consistent. And we're continuing, as you can imagine, to track it on a day-by-day, hour-by-hour basis, so we can make the necessary adjustment. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So 2 margin questions. First, Dave, on the gross margin, up 150 year-over-year. You think about the lower promotions and the mix benefit, how did the underlying expansion play out relative to your plan? And then in an environment, hypothetically, where the category goes flat or, let's say, down low single digits in the back half of the year because the recession lingers longer, how do you think about SG&A dollar growth or payroll deleverage in that sort of environment given the strong flexibility that you've shown over the past 18 months? \nDavid Denton: Sure. So I'll take gross margin. I'll flip to Joe to talk a bit about SG&A. I think, obviously, from a gross margin perspective, is my -- in my prepared comments, we made really nice progress. I think maybe the best way to look at it is in February. So when we entered the year, we were actively running our playbook. We had work between finance and merchandising to improve our cost complement, to partner more deeply with vendors, to manage our promotional cadence more effectively. And I think we're largely hitting in -- hitting our plan, if not, probably a little bit in advance of our plan as we went into February. Obviously, we got turbocharged a bit from a gross margin expansion perspective due to COVID in the back half of the quarter, but I feel like the underlying elements that we had put in place are driving really solid performance there. We still have work to do. We're not done. This is a marathon, not a sprint. But I think we have the right pieces together to play out and improve our margin performance, both in the short term but the long term. \n And maybe I'll flip it to Joe to talk a bit about SG&A. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Chris. So from an SG&A standpoint, the team did a really nice job in Q1, obviously, as Dave had mentioned. And as we look forward, it would be continued strong sales. We have a rule of thumb based on sales outperformance and payroll leverage. But in addition, the hard work that the ops team has done, putting new engineered labor standards in, the labor engine that the team built, the mix between ticket and transactions, and we're very confident in our ability to continue to leverage on SG&A. \nDavid Denton: Great. Thank you very much for calling in today and talking about Lowe's. Please stay safe and healthy. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. This is an unprecedented time as we all navigate the ongoing global economic, social and health impacts of COVID-19. I'd like to start out by extending my best wishes for the health and safety to you and to your families. \n Like most retailers, we began the first quarter focused on meeting our internal financial plan, while executing our Q1 retail strategy. However, due to the global health crisis caused by COVID-19, everything changed in late February, and we immediately pivoted by establishing a cross-functional COVID-19 task force, opening a company-wide command center and reprioritizing our Q1 objectives. \n As a company, our focus shifted from running a business to achieve our financial plan to functioning as an essential retailer, operating in a pandemic with 3 key priorities: first, creating a safe store environment for our associates and our customers; second, providing support for our community, including health care providers and first responders; and third, financially supporting our associates during this unprecedented time. As a result of these new priorities, in the first quarter, we invested $340 million to support our associates, health care workers, first responders and community. In addition, we've committed $50 million of charitable contribution for our communities to do our part in this time of need. \n I'd like to begin by highlighting a few of the operational actions that we took in response to COVID-19, and later in the call, Joe will provide more details on these efforts. In early March, we shortened our store operating hours by closing 3 hours earlier each day at 7 p.m., so we could increase third-party cleaning routines and restock shelves. During the hours that our stores were open, we implemented several operational changes to ensure the safety of our associates and our customers. Including the garden centers, our stores average 144,000 square feet of space. To develop our social distancing safety procedures, our team took a strategic data-driven approach, tracking historical customer traffic patterns and identifying areas where customers tend to congregate. Based on this analysis, we implemented additional safety and social distancing protocols in 3 distinct areas: point-of-sale checkout; outside garden; and the paint desk. Our store team was so effective at implementing and executing the enhanced safety guidelines that our customer service scores improved 200 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter. This is truly an incredible accomplishment and a reflection of our commitment to customer service, even in this unprecedented environment. \n Also to provide our valued associates with a much deserved day off to spend with their families and their loved ones, we closed all stores and distribution centers on Easter Sunday. This decision negatively impacted sales and operating income, but it was absolutely the right thing to do for our associates. \n We have a unique and resilient business model that operates well when our communities need us most. Whether it's a hurricane, flood, tornado or a global health crisis, we are committed to being there for our customers. And I am pleased that over the past 18 months, we've established the agility to provide our customers with the essential products they need to keep their home safe and functional and their businesses running. \n None of our success in the first quarter would have been possible without the outstanding commitment of our store associates working under unprecedented conditions. Our field leaders also distinguished themselves during the quarter. Division Presidents, regional Vice Presidents, district managers and field merchants abandoned their normal routines and spent time each week visiting stores to provide leadership support and guidance for our store managers and frontline leaders. As someone who started out their retail career as a $4.35 an hour part-time store associate, I understand the importance of seeing the leaders of the company out on the front lines during a crisis. \n Let me now turn to our first quarter results, which reflect the benefits of our retail fundamental strategy, the improvement in our overall execution and the strength of our home improvement business model. For the first quarter, we delivered strong sales growth, with total company comp sales growing 11.2%. Our U.S. home improvement comp was 12.3% due to strong demand from both DIY and Pro customers. Overall demand strengthened as we moved through the quarter, and net sales momentum has continued into the month of May. \n For the quarter, DIY comp slightly outpaced Pro comp, and the uptick in DIY demand was partly driven by the arrival of spring weather in many Western and Southern geographies, as well as a customer mindset that was heavily concentrated on the home. We saw broad-based project activity, ranging from outdoor landscaping and other beautification projects to essential indoor, repair and maintenance work and long deferred home projects, the to-do list that customers hadn't previously tackled given their busy schedule. \n Comp sales for Pro was strong, supported by our focus on retail fundamentals, including job lot quantities, more flexible delivery and the improved service model that we put in place in 2019. And as you would expect, we saw increased demand in COVID-related products, such as cleaning supplies and appliances, like refrigerators and freezer. Partly offsetting these gains was softness in heavy indoor installation categories, such as kitchen and bath, as customers were reluctant to invite people into their homes. In total, we estimate that the net impact of COVID-related sales contributed approximately 850 basis points to our total company comp growth, which includes 80 basis points of cleaning product, 70 basis points of refrigerator and freezer sales and 700 basis points in acceleration of projects primarily for the DIY customer. \n As we move through the quarter, there was also a sharp uptick in sales on Lowes.com, as customers began to shop more and more online. Our investments in online infrastructure and progress to date with the Google Cloud migration greatly improved site stability and allowed us to effectively handle the increased traffic. For the quarter, Lowes.com sales were up 80% overall, with even stronger growth rates for our Pro customers. Online penetration increased to 8% of total sales. \n From a geographic perspective, we had broad-based growth with positive comps in all 15 geographic regions and all 3 U.S. divisions. Regions that outperformed the total company comps were Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Nashville, Los Angeles, St. Louis and Seattle. And once again, the West was our top-performing geographic division. The geographic footprint of our stores in the U.S. also played a role in our strong sales performance in Q1. \n The COVID-19 crisis created less disruption in rural areas of the country where approximately 1/4 of our store base is located. Our rural stores outperformed the company comp in Q1 by over 250 basis points. Conversely, on average, our urban stores experienced more demand disruption from the COVID-19 crisis. Approximately 10% of our U.S. store base is classified as urban. This subset of stores underperformed the company comp by more than 400 basis points. \n In Canada, we posted negative comp sales as performance was adversely impacted by store closures and other regulatory-related operating restriction. We have initiatives in place to improve performance and remain confident in the long-term potential of our Canadian business. \n During the quarter, we shifted our marketing efforts by dramatically limiting our promotional messaging and instead highlighting our commitment to our communities and our appreciation for our frontline associates. In fact, as the presenting sponsor on ESPN for the NFL Draft, which posted record-setting viewership, we ran a campaign to spotlight and thank our associates and how they support their communities and the first responders in a time of crisis. Although actions like closing on Easter, reducing promotions, closing stores 3 hours early each day and limiting customer access to key areas, like paint and garden, limited our sales in the quarter, they are a reflection of our culture and to the fundamental commitment to the safety of our associates and our customers. \n Our Q1 results also showed that while consumers were sheltering in place this quarter, they had an opportunity to rediscover Lowe's, both in-store and online. And the improvements we made in our business over the last 18 months allowed us to meet the customer demand. \n I'm also pleased that during this time of high levels of unemployment in our country, Lowe's has hired over 100,000 store associates for the spring season. In addition, to assist other retails and operating safely in this exceptionally challenging environment, we shared our best practices with the Retail Industry Leaders Association. In fact, the only competitive threat we're focused on right now is the COVID-19 virus. \n Although our current and future environment is unpredictable, I am confident in our ability to execute and continue to provide the essential products and services that our communities need. And in closing, I am tremendously proud of our associates and would like to again express my heartfelt appreciation for their hard work and their dedication. And I also want to thank our vendor partners for their great efforts to step up to the challenges that this pandemic had presented. \n And with that, I will turn the call over to Joe to discuss the actions that we've taken to support our customers, operate effectively and keep our associates safe. Simeon, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part, then I'll let Dave take the second piece. You're right, this is a very unique and unprecedented environment that we're in. But what we can tell you is that we had very strong sales in April. And as Dave mentioned in his prepared comments, that momentum has continued into May. That includes a triple-digit comps in Lowes.com that also transitioned from April into May. We don't anticipate we're going to see negative comps, but we do anticipate that we're going to see sales start to moderate at some point in the latter part of this quarter and in the back half of the year. \n What's interesting about this environment is that this is not a housing recession. If you go back to 2008, 2009, you're in a housing recession, and so the home improvement business was directly impacted. This is obviously different. And we're seeing still sustained strength from our homeowners because they're sheltering in place, and they're finding those projects around the house. Having said that, like every other company out there, we have very limited visibility to what's going to happen in the out months and out quarters, but we do feel as though, even in this unprecedented environment, we have a really good execution plan. And we think the results in Q1 reflected that. So I'll let Dave add anything. Well, I think what's interesting is the strength remains in DIY. But for us, the Pro customer remains healthy, and that customer has transitioned primarily to outside project. Also as a reminder, our Pro customer is the smaller, what we call it, a pickup truck Pro. That Pro was less impacted in this forced downturn than the larger, more industrial Pro. So even though Pro was not as robust as DIY, our Pro's growth was still really strong in the quarter, and that strength continues. And their pipeline is more delayed and not canceled, and now you're starting to see those jobs pick up. \n Another interesting data point is in the states that are beginning to reopen, we are seeing our stores outperform the total company comp in those locations, which, to us, is a data point, but it's a glimmer of hope that we're able to sustain our performance, even when there is a broader competitive landscape out there. \n But again, Simeon, there's a lot we don't know. There's a lot of uncertainty. But as Dave said, we have a lot of levers that we can pull from an expense management perspective. And Bill Boltz and Joe McFarland have really detailed playbooks from the 2008, 2009 period when we had to transition, in our old life, to a more repair and maintenance type of strategy. We know how to do that. So if that is a requirement, we have a very experienced team of merchants and operators that can make that pivot. Well, Mike, we don't see this as a pull-forward because these were projects that were on the customers' to-do list that they simply didn't have time to get to. I mean, as a reminder, I mean, we're in the essential retail business, and 2/3 of what we sell is nondiscretionary. And what we saw a lot is customers coming in and fixing things that they had just delayed. So we don't see it as a pull-forward at all. \n Look, we're blessed to be open. We're very thankful that we're open. But this is, without question, the most challenging environment that any of us have ever worked in. And when we look at what the customers are buying and we look at the sustainability of it, we don't see what occurred in Q1. We don't see what occurred in April as a pull-forward. We just see it as a unique demand shift based on the competitive landscape and based on customers sheltering in place. So Seth, I'll take the first part, and then I hand it over to Joe McFarland. I think that the key to our ability to have the leverage performance was the new scheduling and labor management system. Timing is everything, and our associates have been incredibly heroic during this time. But the ability to make sure we could look at the demands of the business by location, by department of the store to schedule effectively was in large parts. \n I'll let Joe McFarland talk about what we were able to benefit from the labor scheduling system, in addition to some other expense-related initiatives that they drove in operation. So Seth, I mean, our goal is to take care of our associates. I mean we're really proud that in Q1, we invested roughly $340 million in our associates and our customers and communities. We're going to continue to make sure that we take care of our associates as this pandemic continues to drive a unique environment in our stores. Like anything else, it's difficult for us to project when that's going to be. But as an example, we paid out $80 million in special payments in the month of March, $2 wage increase for hourly associates in the month of April, another $80-plus million in special payments for the month of May. Joe talked about the Winning Together payment that we're going to make over and above the target for the month of June. And so we've looked at the needs of our associate, and we'll make the appropriate decision based on what we think is in their best interest. So I'll take the first one and let Joe talk about the install piece. The short answer is yes. DIY remains very, very strong. Pro is improving. And remember what I said, because our Pro is that smaller pickup truck Pro, the desk Pro tends to be less impacted by macroeconomic factors. And so desk Pro was healthy, but they're getting even more healthy as the weeks and days progresses throughout the year. And as I mentioned, in states that are reopening, we see strength in our business, but we also see strength in these urban store locations. Remember, I mentioned in the first quarter, our remote stores dramatically outperformed urban stores by almost 650 basis points. We're starting to see those urban markets start to improve as well. And so as Dave mentioned, there's a broad geographic positive double-digit performance that we're seeing. \n And Joe can talk a little bit about the install piece. Well, what I can tell you, Greg, is that we're just pleased that the work that we put into stabilizing and modernizing Lowes.com is starting to pay dividends. As we mentioned in the last couple of calls back last year, the entire dot-com site was on a decade-old platform. And so we're in the process of transitioning that to Google Cloud, will be complete this quarter, but that allowed us to take on the demand. And what we're seeing is that customers simply want to shop the way that they choose to. And in the past, we couldn't accommodate that. Joe mentioned in his prepared comments, when we start to get request from customers for curbside, we put that up and going in 3 days. I mean this time last year, it would've been impossible to do that because we didn't have the infrastructure. \n Bill Boltz and the merchant team has also done a really nice job of adding additional SKUs, and I'll let Bill talk about some of the work the merchants have done that has allowed us to drive the dot-com business and some of the future work that we have in place to drive dot-com for the balance of the year. And Greg, the other point I make, I mean, I would say, roughly 90% of our dot-com sales are fulfilled or picked up at a store. And for us, that's significant because anytime the customer can pick it up at a store, that helps us to defer the cost of operating that platform. The good news is Lowes.com will only get better for the balance of the year. And as I mentioned, we're triple-digit growth in April. We're triple-digit growth month-to-date, and we can sustain that. And we're having improved functionality for the customer each and every week, and that's something that we're excited about the future. Eric, this is Marvin. I'll take the Spring Black Friday, and I'll let Bill talk about Memorial Day and Q2. So when we look at Spring Black Friday, we received minimal incremental sales benefit from the event. Due to the distribution process of print media, we were unsuccessful in pulling the tap from distribution. But when we look at all other forms of media, all other traffic driving mechanisms for the event was pulled. So from that, the sales were minimal. And let me make sure, just for the broad audience, I define how we look at print media. Print is the least effective marketing medium that we have, and total sales contribution generated by print for Lowe's is 0.7%. So I know there was a lot of discussion that Spring Black Friday was a benefit to us in the quarter. But as I said, it was incrementally minimal at best. \n In addition to that, as you know, we closed for Easter. And we were forecasting Easter to be a plus-$200 million day. And when Dave Denton, Joe McFarland, Bill Boltz and I sat down and made that decision to close, we had no idea at that time how we would make the sales up. But we felt like it was in the best interest of our associates and their families to give them a day off, and we would just take the financial hit, for lack of a better term, for that decision. But we felt like that it was simply culturally the right thing to do. So when we take then close for Easter, when we take full in all other traffic driving mechanisms for Spring Black Friday, both events turned into a negative environment from a sales perspective for us. So that kind of summarizes Easter and Spring Black Friday. And looking in the rearview mirror, I'll let Bill talk about Q2. And Eric, the last point I'll make, and I think Dave will close the comment is, I mean, at the end of the day, we want to be a value-oriented retailer. But we don't want to be promotional. I think that's what just a point that Bill has said from his very first day here. So you may not see us using traffic driving media to get incremental footsteps in the store in this unique environment that we're operating in, but when the customers come in, we want them to see a value on the shelf because if there is a time that you ever needed a value for customers, this is one of those times. But we will be very cognizant and conscious of not driving traffic in an environment where that may put people at risk. And that's something that we're going to balance really well. Kate, this is Marvin. That's a really good question. What I will tell you is that this was such a unique quarter, and we were so focused on, first and foremost, making sure that we were looking into the health and safety of our associates and our customers. That is not a dataset that we spend a ton of time looking at. Candidly, as I said in my prepared comments, the moment we started to address the challenges of COVID-19 for our associates and customers, we became less focused on the financial performance of the company, and we became more focused on trying to provide the essential products that our customers and communities needed. I'm sure we can get that data, and we can probably share. I'm sure Investor Relations team can get it for you, but we were just so focused on just trying to run this business, serve our customers, serve our communities and keep our associates safe. But there are a lot of datasets we didn't pay a lot of attention to this quarter. No. Average ticket remains strong. We have seen no trade-down. Our customer segment has been surprisingly resilient. And as I stated earlier, customers have rediscovered Lowe's. We know that for a fact. But again, patterns have been strong. They've been very consistent. And we're continuing, as you can imagine, to track it on a day-by-day, hour-by-hour basis, so we can make the necessary adjustment."

            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by echoing Marvin's appreciation for the tremendous work that our associates have done during this crisis across our stores and distribution network. As always, our highest priority is the health and safety of our associates and customers. \n I'll now take a moment to review the operational changes that we implemented this quarter in response to COVID-19. We began with an immediate assessment of how to best facilitate social distancing in our operations and then quickly acted to implement the following: additional signage and floor markers; adding social distancing ambassadors to manage customer traffic flow; leveraging new technology available on handheld smart devices to monitor store traffic, helping store managers limit customers based on the store footprint, in line with regulatory requirements; and we're moving product from our stores to help free up additional space for our customers, especially in high-traffic areas. \n As Marvin mentioned, on average, our stores are 144,000 square feet in size, including the garden center. Therefore, we also deployed a data-driven process to implement additional safety measures in areas where customers tend to congregate, such as our point-of-sale registers, the garden center and the paint desk. For example, in our garden centers, we utilized our Merchandising Services Teams, or MSTs, to remove shelving in product to encourage customers to spread out. And at the garden center entrance, we set up one-way traffic flows and limited the number of customers entering at any one time. \n To ensure a clean, safe operating environment, we implemented more stringent cleaning procedures, added more hours for our third-party cleaning service and closed our stores 3 hours early at 7 p.m. to allow for increased cleaning and restocking activities. We also determined that keeping our stores open until 7 p.m. allowed for enough operating hours during the day to minimize concentration of customer traffic. \n Lowe's is one of the first retailers to install Plexiglass shields at the point-of-sale areas in all stores. We also distributed gloves and masks to our associates to wear during their shifts. \n As a reflection of our commitment to our associates, we provided them with additional financial assistance totaling $290 million in incremental investment in the first quarter. We made 2 special payments to hourly associates to help with unexpected expenses, one in March and one in May, with each payment consisting of $300 for full time and $150 for part time and seasonal associates. And for the month of April, we instituted a temporary wage increase of $2 per hour for all hourly associates. \n To further protect the health of our associates and those around them, we offered 14 days of emergency paid leave for all associates who needed it. And for those at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, we offered emergency paid leave of up to 4 weeks. And to show our support to our dedicated frontline managers, we have provided them with an additional 2 weeks of paid vacation to recharge and spend time with their families. We also extended telemedicine services to all associates and their families, whether or not they were enrolled in Lowe's medical plans. \n And to do our part in protecting frontline medical workers and first responders, we committed $50 million of support to our communities this year, including approximately $10 million worth of essential protective products, including N95 masks. \n And as online demand increased, smart devices allowed associates to go buy online, pick up in store and parcel shipping orders more efficiently. In fact, this quarter, we rolled out curbside pickup in a matter of days. This rapid response would not have been possible without the technology we deployed in 2019. \n Our new customer-centric scheduling system and scheduling effectiveness tools also allowed us to monitor store traffic versus associate availability and deliver customized, tiered sets of priorities for stores based on their capacity level. \n As we look forward, we remain committed to our retail fundamental strategy and investing for future growth. \n In closing, I'm incredibly proud of how our associates responded and adapted to this challenging environment. They serve our customers and communities in a time of tremendous need, and we remain committed to supporting them as our most valuable asset. I'm really pleased to announce that 100% of our stores earned the Winning Together profit sharing bonuses this quarter totaling $87 million. Based on stronger-than-expected store performance, this represents an incremental $24 million payment to our frontline associates, above the target payment level. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Bill. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin this morning by reviewing the liquidity actions that we took during the quarter and provide an update on our capital allocation priorities. Given the uncertain economic outlook, we decided to bolster our liquidity to plan for any unforeseen disruptions. \n In Q1, we raised $4 billion in senior notes and increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility by $770 million. After repaying $500 million of senior notes due in April of 2020, we now have $6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as well as $3 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, which can be made available for any unanticipated needs and liquidity. We believe that we have more than adequate liquidity to manage through any of the potential scenarios that we could be facing. \n During the quarter, we also decided to halt our share repurchases program. Furthermore, we do not anticipate doing any more share repurchases this year beyond what we executed in the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased 9.6 million shares for $947 million at an average price of $98.45 per share. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend program. And as always, we look for ways to drive shareholder value over the long term. \n Also consistent with our capital allocation framework, we are continuing to prioritize investments in the business for future growth. In the quarter, capital expenditures totaled $328 million, and we are still planning for a total of $1.6 billion in capital expenditures through this year. In certain cases, we have reprioritized some capital projects to focus on the near-term need to improve our omnichannel capabilities, but our expectations for the total spend in 2020 remains unchanged. \n I'll now turn to a review of our operating performance, beginning with the income statement. In Q1, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.76 per share compared to $1.31 in the first quarter of LY, an increase of 35%. In the quarter, there was a very modest impact on operating income related to the previously announced Canadian restructuring. \n My comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. In Q1, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.77, an increase of 45% compared to the prior year. These results exceeded expectations largely due to stronger-than-expected sales and gross margin rate, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. Sales for the first quarter were $19.7 billion, an increase of 11.2% on a comparable basis versus the prior year period, with total average ticket growth of 9.7%, while transactions grew by 1.2%. \n U.S. comp sales were up 12.3% in the quarter, and we were encouraged to see strength in our performance across both DIY and Pro customers and across all geographies. Our U.S. monthly comps increased as we moved through the quarter with 5.1% in February, 8.9% in March and 20.4% in April. February's financial performance was largely in line with our expectations. But beginning of March, we saw sales impacted by COVID-related prep activities and customers working on long delayed projects as they sheltered in place. \n Also Lowes.com sales ticked up meaningfully in March as more customers increasingly utilized online shopping options. Sales continued to accelerate into April with a large step-up mid-month. Lowes.com sales also increased significantly with comps of over 150% in the month, while our installed sales declined approximately 50% as many customers were unwilling to allow installation work in their homes. \n The strong broad-based trends that we saw in April have continued into May, with strength across both DIY and Pro and across nearly all merchandising categories and all geographies. For May month-to-date, U.S. comp sales have been trending at or above April results, with strong double-digit comps across all geographic regions. \n Gross margin was 33.1% of sales in the first quarter, an increase of 164 basis points compared to Q1 of LY. Gross margin rate improved 110 basis points driven both by the actions that we took last year to lower product cost and improve our pricing and promotional performance as well as a 40 basis point benefit from lower promotional activities throughout the quarter. \n As Marvin mentioned, the company pulled back on promotional marketing in an effort to limit nonessential traffic given the stay-at-home orders across the nation. Gross margin also benefited from approximately 55 basis points related to favorable product mix. \n SG&A for Q1 was 21.3% of sales, an improvement of 45 basis points over the prior year. This included $320 million of COVID-related expenses incurred during the quarter, with $275 million in financial assistance for our frontline associates, approximately $35 million related to cleaning and other pandemic-related operating expenses and approximately $10 million in charitable contributions. While the $320 million of COVID-related expenses resulted in SG&A deleverage of 160 basis points, the impact was more than offset by payroll leverage of 105 basis points driven by higher sales and improved store efficiencies, advertising leverage of 40 basis points and employee insurance leverage of 25 basis points. \n Adjusted operating income margin increased 208 basis points to 10.16% of sales. Note that COVID-related expenses are not excluded from our adjusted results. \n The effective tax rate was 25.1% compared to 16.6% last year. The prior year quarter benefited from a change in approach related to the exit of our Mexico operations. The adjusted effective tax rate was 25%, above the prior year rate of 22.9%. \n At $14.3 billion, inventory is slightly lower than the prior year levels. \n Now before I close, let me address our 2020 business outlook. Despite our solid performance this quarter and strong sales momentum continuing into May, we are withdrawing our prior guidance for the full year 2020 sales, operating income and earnings per share. In this unprecedented operating environment, we, like other companies, have limited visibility into future business trends, which result in an unusually wide range of potential outcomes for our 2020 financial performance. However, going forward, we would like to provide additional transparency regarding our performance, so it is my expectation that we'll be giving more frequent periodic updates on our results throughout the second quarter. \n In closing, we remain confident about the future of our business and our ability to continue to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value. By the way, I'd like to extend my appreciation to the associates at Lowe's across the world who have risen to meet the challenges of this global health crisis. \n Operator, we are now ready for questions. Yes. Simeon, I'd just add kind of a couple of points. One, real time, we're tactically responding and managing to the increased demands for consumers for these essential products that they're seeing in our stores. So one, real time, we're working on that. \n Secondly, importantly, we're still running our long-term playbook. We're making investments today to drive long-term shareholder value in the out year. So we have not deviated from that playbook. \n And three, we have developed a variety of, I guess, plans that can allow us to flex, both from a merchandising perspective to lean into more nondiscretionary-type items over the back half, if required; and secondly, being able -- with all the tools that we put in place operationally, to be able to flex our labor and operating expense profile to manage in a slightly softer demand environment. Yes. Michael, listen, it's our expectation that we would recover by the end of the year our gross margin to the baseline rate that we talked about. That was our prior guidance. And we're largely working on that day in and day out. I'd say there's a combined team between really merchandise and finance focused against that effort. And I'm actually really pleased with the progress we made, and we continue to push forward. So I feel like we're in really good stead there. We're kind of making the right investments to improve our performance. \n And then secondly, from a share repurchase perspective, listen, we'll wait and see. I think the good news is, at the moment, our cash flow was very robust and really strong. We've shored up our balance sheet from a liquidity perspective. Let's just kind of watch and see just given the dynamic nature of this market and see where we stand. And we'll watch it carefully as we go through the balance of this year. Yes. And Seth, I'll just add, give a shout-out to all the ops team to really be very focused and really drive a lot of efficiencies this quarter. However, there will be additional cost that we will incur as the new operating model goes forward. We incurred cleaning -- incremental cost for cleaning. We're put in social distancing ambassadors in our stores to manage the queues and flow-through from a traffic perspective. So some of those costs, which we incurred about $35 million in the first quarter, are probably ongoing for the balance of this year. It's largely cost in the quarter. There's always some accruals based on when things actually get paid. But largely, this is expenses that are incurred in Q1. That's correct. If you look at our leverage ratio as we sit today, we're probably a little bit over 2.8 at this point in time. But if you net the cash that we have on our balance sheet, we're well below that. And I think just given the unprecedented environment we're operating, we're just going to be conservative here for a while until we kind of see how this plays out for the balance of the year. Yes. And to Marvin's point, obviously, we -- our stores, there's a lot of value in our stores, the items that we sell. And if you just look in the rearview mirror, you look at the number of items that we promoted this year versus the number of items that we sold on promotion last year, we're down about 24%. Sure. So I'll take gross margin. I'll flip to Joe to talk a bit about SG&A. I think, obviously, from a gross margin perspective, is my -- in my prepared comments, we made really nice progress. I think maybe the best way to look at it is in February. So when we entered the year, we were actively running our playbook. We had work between finance and merchandising to improve our cost complement, to partner more deeply with vendors, to manage our promotional cadence more effectively. And I think we're largely hitting in -- hitting our plan, if not, probably a little bit in advance of our plan as we went into February. Obviously, we got turbocharged a bit from a gross margin expansion perspective due to COVID in the back half of the quarter, but I feel like the underlying elements that we had put in place are driving really solid performance there. We still have work to do. We're not done. This is a marathon, not a sprint. But I think we have the right pieces together to play out and improve our margin performance, both in the short term but the long term. \n And maybe I'll flip it to Joe to talk a bit about SG&A. Great. Thank you very much for calling in today and talking about Lowe's. Please stay safe and healthy."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Marvin mentioned, we posted U.S. home improvement comparable sales growth of 12.3% in the first quarter driven by outperformance in essential DIY and Pro categories. 14 of 15 merchandising departments generated positive comps, with weakness limited to installation heavy product in kitchens and bath. We saw very strong COVID-related demand for essential cleaning products, along with other home necessities, such as refrigerators, freezers and DIY home repair products. \n As customers isolated in their homes this quarter, they engaged in a variety of projects, which drove double-digit comps in core spring-related categories, paint and other critical repair and maintenance categories. During the quarter, we posted double-digit comps in lumber, which benefited from strong unit demand from both Pro and DIY customers, but continues to be driven by our improved investments in job lot quantities. \n Core Pro categories also performed well, with double-digit comps in rough plumbing, hardware and tools. Within rough plumbing, we delivered double-digit growth in pipe and fittings, as our expansion of job lot quantities in this area continues to pay off, along with growth in other essential categories, like air filtration, pumps and water filtration. \n Our hardware business benefited from the strength in fasteners and our general hardware categories, supported by the addition of Pro brands, like FastenMaster, GRK and Power Pro One, as these product categories are the critical project completers for both the Pro and the DIY customer. \n In tools, we continue to see a strong customer response to our CRAFTSMAN program, but we also saw strength from the launch of our new Kobalt XTR 24-Volt power tool platform, as both the heavy DIY and Pro customer are quickly recognizing the quality and performance of this great product. \n Within our key Pro tool brands, such as Dewalt, the #1 power tool brand in the industry, we continue to see nice growth across all segments, and we are pleased with the results we are seeing through the addition of our exclusive Dewalt 12-volt compact line of power tools. \n Lastly, we continue to showcase new and innovative tool products from Bosch, Lufkin, Spyder and Metabo HPT, along with Kobalt to build on the strength of our tools business. These brands, combined with our investment in job lot quantities and our improved Pro service model, are driving new customer trial and increasing our share of wallet with our existing Pro customers. \n As Marvin and Joe indicated, the progress we made on our strategic initiatives in 2019 positioned us to execute well this quarter. For example, having our merchants in place for the entire year allowed us to fully plan for the spring season and respond to the rapidly changing operating requirements we are currently facing. I'm also proud of our vendor partnerships and our recent brand introductions, both of which have allowed us to better meet the customer demand. I'd like to take a moment to mention just a few of the suppliers who made an extraordinary effort to keep our stores well stocked this quarter, despite their own challenging operating environments. \n Within our building products categories, some of our suppliers that deserve a special shout-out are Charlotte Pipe, ECMD, SharkBite and Idaho Forest Group. In home decor, 3M, [ monop ] and Samsung were true standouts. And in our hard lines business, Hillman, Bonnie, Oldcastle and MTD products went above and beyond in their responsiveness. \n And finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a big thank you to the efforts put forth by ZEP cleaning products, Safety Zone and Medline, as these 3 suppliers went above and beyond to provide us with hand sanitizer and gloves for our frontline associates. \n Turning back to our associates. Our field merchandising teams played a critical role in helping our stores adjust to the changing environment, along with being on the ground to respond to 10 tornadoes and 2 earthquakes that impacted parts of the U.S. during the quarter. And our Merchandising Service Team, or MST, also went above and beyond as they were ready to do whatever was needed during the quarter to help our stores respond to significant increases in demand. This quarter, our MSTs were key in our ability to quickly reconfigure our stores to support social distancing. The support of these teams is invaluable because they are the boots on the ground focused on taking the time-consuming tasks off the shoulders of our Red Vest associates. \n And looking ahead, we continue to make investments to drive future growth. And in the second quarter, we are excited about our rollout of Simpson Strong-Tie framing hardware and fasteners. These trusted Pro products will be available in stores nationwide, with an expanded assortment on Lowes.com, helping Pros to fulfill all their hardware needs in one place, saving them time and money. \n And as spring has now arrived across the country, we will continue to leverage our position as the #1 destination for outdoor power equipment in the U.S., with our leading brands, such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Ariens and CRAFTSMAN, to provide customers with an outstanding selection of products to help them complete their outdoor projects. At the same time, we're proud to offer our customers the top 2 brands in grilling, Weber and Char-Broil. \n As we've discussed previously, we remain focused on completing our Google Cloud migration in the second quarter to ensure that we build a strong infrastructure for Lowes.com. And the teams are working quickly to add capabilities to Lowes.com over the next 3 quarters that will further enhance the customer experience and to continue to grow sales on this digital platform. \n In closing, we remain committed to the work ahead to serve our customers and our communities as they navigate the public health challenge of COVID-19, while building capabilities to serve them even better in the future. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Dave. Yes. This is Bill. So just a lot of work from the online team as well as the core merchants to get relevant SKUs online, relevant categories of product, in addition to being able to support the operation work that goes on inside the store. But along that, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the capabilities that the team is continuing to work on to enhance delivery operations, to schedule deliveries, to be able to shift from many of our locations, all of that work continuing to go and to be put in place through the balance of the year. So just lots of improvement that will continue to go on Lowes.com. Yes. Eric, in regards to the pricing strategy, as we've shared with you before, our intention has always been to change the pricing strategy at Lowe's and get to be more of an everyday competitive price program. And so that work really started a year ago. It continues into 2020. So as we look at Memorial Day, Memorial Day is going to be very consistent to how we operated in Q1. And as we get into the back half of Q2, with July 4 and Father's Day, we'll get, again, trying to implement the pieces and the place, the pricing strategy, more of a normal cadence from being relevant for dad and being relevant for the holiday on July 4. So that's how we're going to approach the quarter."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Seth. This is Joe. So as we've been working on our 60-40, and again, that is to shift our labor productivity from tasking to selling, we are well on our way in our 60-40 transition. And so if you think about things that Marvin mentioned, the customer-centric schedule, we were able to really dial in our associate staffing based on departments that were lifting, reallocate labor in the areas of the store that were suffering. And also the smartphones, the ability for the associates to be able to sustain 150% comps in dot-com in the month of April and 80% for the quarter would not have been doable had we not done things, like our pick app, in the smartphone applications that really allow the associates to set up curbside delivery. \n And so, Seth, there are a number of things throughout the quarter, the operational initiatives that we continue to stay focused on, our centralized receiving. So a lot of things allowed us to gain that leverage. Yes. So from the install piece, Marvin mentioned that our install heavy related categories for the quarter were significantly down, as referenced in our negative comps in kitchen and bath. As we have progressed through the quarter and looked week by week, we have a really robust dashboard that we look at that includes things like future leads. And so on the exterior installation projects, we're really seeing that business come back very, very quickly. So we're very pleased there. We are making progress on the interior projects, but that will be slow, and that will be tempered as our consumers feel more and more comfortable allowing our Pros in their home, our installers in their home. Yes. So Greg, it's Joe. So just over 60% of our orders are picked up in store, and then the incremental is fulfilled primarily through store. Yes. Thanks, Chris. So from an SG&A standpoint, the team did a really nice job in Q1, obviously, as Dave had mentioned. And as we look forward, it would be continued strong sales. We have a rule of thumb based on sales outperformance and payroll leverage. But in addition, the hard work that the ops team has done, putting new engineered labor standards in, the labor engine that the team built, the mix between ticket and transactions, and we're very confident in our ability to continue to leverage on SG&A."

        "symbol": "LOW",
        "quarter": 4,
        "year": 2021,
        "date": "2022-02-23 00:00:00",
        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe's Companies Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Dave Denton, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2022. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.  Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone.  Our results once again beat expectations this quarter, with comparable sales up 5% for the total company and 5.1% for the U.S. on top of over 28% growth last year. This resulted in comp sales of 34.5% for the total company and up 35.2% for the U.S. on a 2-year basis. These results capped of outstanding financial results for fiscal 2021 with sales of $96.3 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable basis and earnings per share of $12.04, up 36% on an adjusted basis.  \n With these outstanding results, 100% of our stores earned a quarterly Winning Together profit-sharing bonus. This $94 million payout is $24 million above the target payment level. And in recognition for their hard work throughout the pandemic in 2021, we are awarding an incremental discretionary bonus of $265 million to our frontline associates. Altogether, we rewarded our frontline associates with bonuses of over $350 million in the fourth quarter. As Joe will discuss later in the call, financial support of our frontline associates is consistent with our commitment to being an employer of choice in the retail industry.  Our Total Home strategy continues to gain momentum, as we grow our share of wallet with both Pro and DIY as they increasingly rely on Lowe's as a one-stop solution for all their project needs. In looking at our results this quarter, I'm particularly encouraged that our growth was broad based and balanced across product categories, across both DIY and Pro, both online and in-store.  \n In Pro, we delivered growth of 23% and 54% on a 2-year basis. And we are building on our momentum with the Pro with the launch of our new Pro loyalty program, MVPs Pro Rewards  and Partnership Program.  We redesigned our loyalty program based on feedback from our Pro customers who expressed a desire for a business partnership rather than a series of stand-alone transactions. Our data shows that Pros who leverage our loyalty and credit offering spend 300% more than Pros not engaged in these programs. Our Pro business is off to a strong start this year, and we're excited about the national launch of our MVPs Pro loyalty program.  I look forward to providing updates on this critical initiative throughout the year.  Now turning to our DIY customer, where we delivered growth on top of exceptionally strong demand last year. Later in the call, Bill will discuss how we continue to grow our DIY market share by elevating our private brands product assortments in our home decor category.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 11.5% on top of 121% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a 2-year comp of 147% and nearly 11% sales penetration. Our intuitive online shopping experience and expanded on-trend assortments are resonating with our customers. And while we're pleased that our online sales have more than doubled over the past 2 years, we still have tremendous growth opportunity in front of us. And as part of our efforts to enhance our omnichannel experience, we are expanding our same-day and next-day fulfillment capabilities.  \n With that in mind, we're actively piloting several gig network solutions, including partnering with Instacart in several markets with same-day DIY home delivery. And building on the success we gained in the Florida and Ohio Valley regions with our market delivery strategy, we completed the conversion of our third geographic area, the Carolina region, during the fourth quarter. By way of reminder, in the market-based delivery model, big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers' homes. This replaces the highly inefficient store delivery model where each store acts as its own distribution and transportation center for these products.  As we continue to expand our market-based delivery model, we're freeing up space in our 10,000 square foot store back rooms,  which on average are considerably larger than our competition. And we are testing out different options to drive both greater in-store fulfillment and expanded delivery alternatives for both Pro and DIY customers. In a few minutes, Bill will discuss our continued investments in online as we create a best-in-class integrated omnichannel shopping experience.  \n During the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 115 basis points, leading to diluted earnings per share of $1.78, which is a 34% increase as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year. These results reflect our disciplined focus on driving operating leverage through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI, as well as the ongoing benefits of our new pricing strategies. Joe and Dave will discuss these initiatives in further detail later in the call.  Turning to our results in Canada where performance lagged the U.S. The Canadian leadership team continues to drive productivity through proven technology and processes that have delivered great results in the U.S.  Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market, as well as our opportunity to continue to win share. Our outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong, supported by a very healthy consumer balance sheet, especially for homeowners and continuing home price appreciation. Persistent solid demand for homes despite an uptick in interest rates is also expected to support residential investment. In fact, we're encouraged by the strengthening millennial household formation trends that will support home buying in the coming years.  \n Other trends remain favorable, including baby boomers' increasing preference to-age-in-place.  And with the extension of remote work for some employees, we're expecting a permanent step-up in repair and maintenance cycle. And as a reminder, 50% of the homes in the U.S. are over 40 years old and will continue to require investments for upkeep and approximately 2/3 of Lowe's annual sales are generated from repair and maintenance activity. Therefore, we're encouraged that the macro environment for home improvement remains very supportive.  \n As we close the year, we continue to give back to the communities where we operate, with total donations of $100 million in 2021 well over our pre-pandemic levels. And we're pleased that our efforts to enhance our brand reputation while supporting our associates and driving long-term value for our shareholders and was recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as they named Lowe's the #1 Most Admired Specialty Retailer for the second year in a row. This is the first time in our history that we received this recognition in back-to-back years.  \n In closing, I'd like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our frontline associates. As I travel the country every week visiting stores, I continue to be struck by their commitment to supporting our communities while providing excellent customer service.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.  In the fourth quarter, U.S. comparable sales increased 5.1% and 35.2% on a 2-year basis. We delivered positive comps in all 3 merchandising divisions in the quarter with growth across Pro and DIY customers. Growth was well balanced with 12 of 15 merchandising departments comping positive and was broad-based on a 2-year basis with all 15 departments up more than 18% in that time frame.  \n Beginning with our Home Decor merchandising division, flooring and appliances  delivered the strongest comps in the quarter. In flooring, vinyl flooring once again led the way as we continue to see consumer preference shifting towards this affordable and stylish solution. Lowe's already offers a wide selection of vinyl flooring products, including several Pergo WetProtect options. And this year, we look forward to extending our own trusted STAINMASTER brand with its high performance characteristics and lifetime stain-resistant warranty across a full range of flooring products, including laminate, tile and vinyl.  Within appliances, sales of ranges, cooktops, along with dishwashers were the strongest in the quarter. As we continue to extend our private brand offering, we recently launched Origin 21 across several product categories in home decor. This is our new modern brand designed for the trend-setting millennial consumer, while our ever popular allen + roth brand is tailored to the more traditional style.  \n Now turning to our performance in hardlines. The team delivered an exceptional holiday season. Customers were active early and shopped often in our trim and tree category, which drove excellent sell-through in this holiday category. Seasonal, outdoor living and lawn and garden delivered standout performances, as customers continue to enhance their outdoor living spaces with new grills, patio heaters, fire pits, as well as live goods for the yards and garden. With the home serving as a center for entertainment, our customers are making the most of their homes, inside and out.  \n We continue to build on our #1 position in outdoor power equipment with further share gains in battery outdoor power equipment, as we drove over 37% growth in this area for the quarter and over 118% on a 2-year basis. Both DIY and Pro customers enjoy the convenience, reliability and the power of our innovative battery-powered products available in the EGO, Kobalt,  CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands. In this spring, we are thrilled to expand our exclusive lineup of EGO battery products with their new 52-inch zero-turn riding mower with features that include a fabricated deck and power to mow up to 4 acres on a single charge. Also new for EGO is the industry's most powerful handheld battery-powered blower with power that will outperform the leading gas blower with 765 cubic feet per minute of blowing capacity. These new products will complement our existing lineup and assortments from powerful brands, such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and CRAFTSMAN.  This spring, we will launch our new Origin 21 patio collections, as well as our new style selection replacement cushions. These cushions are made with 100% recycled plastic bottles and they are fade-resistant, UV-protected as well as easy to clean.  \n Now turning to the building products division. Our comps were very strong driven by broad-based balanced growth across lumber, electrical, rough plumbing, millwork and building materials. We are pleased with the continued momentum we are building with the Pro as we work to expand our brand and product offerings to meet their project needs.  \n New this year will be a full range of CertainTeed roofing,  insulation and gypsum products. As a leading manufacturer of building products for both residential and commercial construction, CertainTeed is an important strategic partner that we are proud to add to Lowe's as we continue to enhance our Pro offering in the building materials category.  We also continue to build out our Pro power tool program with the introduction of the new DEWALT power stack battery technology, which is the smallest and most energy-densed battery pack on the market. These new products and new brands are strong additions to our Pro brand arsenal, which already includes other great brands like Bosch, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner. \n Moving to Lowes.com. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered sales growth of 11.5% in the quarter and 147% on a 2-year basis in the fourth quarter. We are focused on further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities in 2022 across 3 key areas: expanding our online assortment; enhancing the user experience; and improving fulfillment.  First, we are expanding our Lowes.com assortment to meet our customers' design and lifestyle needs. For example, within Lowe's Livable Home products, we will offer a range of products to help our customers adapt to their changing mobility needs. At the same time, we will continue to enhance the user experience with continued upgrades to the visualization and configuration tools, like kitchen visualizer and Measure Your Space. \n Finally, as we continue to improve our fulfillment capabilities, our customers can now track their appliance delivery in real time, and we will soon be leveraging enhanced technology to further streamline the buy online, pick-up in store experience for our customers through an improved store execution process.  As we look ahead to spring, we are well positioned to capitalize on what we expect to be another strong spring season. Consistent with our approach over the past year, we have worked hard to land our spring product early. Through an expansion of our network of coastal holding facilities,  we are better able to manage the flow of imported product enabling us to quickly flow product where needed as spring arrives across the country.  As one of the largest importers in the U.S., we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and work to mitigate and manage the impact of cost increases across our supply chain.  Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our merchants and inventory and supply chain teams, along with our vendors for their hard work and continued support.  \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for delivering tremendous results in 2021. In recognition of their outstanding efforts, we awarded the discretionary year-end bonus of $6,000 for assistant store managers, $1,000 for department supervisors, $800 for full-time hourly associates and $400 for part-time hourly associates. As Marvin mentioned, the combination of Winning Together and this discretionary year-end bonus will result in a payout of over $350 million for our frontline associates this quarter.  As someone who started his career in home improvement as an hourly associate, I understand how meaningful this type of financial recognition is for our hourly associates. At Lowe's, our people are truly our most valuable asset. When it comes to recruiting and retaining top talent, we strive to be an employer of choice.  From the moment that a candidate applies for a position at Lowe's, we are committed to creating a positive impression. We have invested in leading technology that accelerates the hiring process, so that we are processing applications in a matter of minutes rather than the weeks that the manual process required as recently as last year.  We also continue to improve our onboarding process so that our new hires can quickly come up to speed, leveraging the technology and product knowledge that is readily available to them on their handheld mobile devices via the Lowe's University application. As I mentioned on our last call, we are also leveraging our new Lowe's University in-store training labs to provide the ongoing training that our associates need to build their skills and confidence so they can continue to progress in their career.  \n Over the last 3 years, we have created valuable career opportunities for our associates with the incremental 10,000 department supervisor roles and 1,600 ASM positions that we have added. Since 2018, we have also invested well over $2 billion in incremental wage and equity programs for our frontline associates to ensure that we continue to offer a strong competitive wage and benefit package to our associates.  I'm really pleased to report that our investments to position Lowe's as an employer of choice are paying off. Heading into spring, we anticipate being even better positioned than last year from a hiring perspective. And we are also confident that we will continue to drive productivity in our operations through our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives.  \n As a reminder, this is not a single win. It is a series of improvements that are scaling across our stores over time. In fact, we are working on over 20 different PPI initiatives in our store operations this year. To highlight just a few key PPI initiatives, we have just launched a new store inventory management system, or SIMs across all of our stores. This platform gives store associates real-time visibility to inventory in their store. This includes inventory in the home bay location as well as product in the top stock and cap, off-shelf and back stock room.  This new system will eliminate the countless nonproductive hours associates have been spending looking for product.  \n I'm also excited about our continuing efforts to eliminate the ancient green screen technology with the launch of our simplified user interface to other selling stations throughout the store. First introduced at our front-end registers, we are beginning to implement this new technology across the sales floor. With this new platform, we are accelerating the associate training process and facilitating cross-training in other departments. This new technology will free up our associates to focus on providing excellent customer service while reducing customer wait time.  While these 2 initiatives are just a few of the PPI deliverables planned for this year, we expect that these 2 initiatives alone will drive $100 million in productivity this year. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage technology to reduce manual tasking for our associates while also enabling them to deliver better service to our Pro and DIY customers.  I would like to close once again by thanking our store associates for their continued hard work and dedication and the great results we achieved together this year. With that, I will turn it over to Dave. \nDavid Denton: Thank you, Joe. I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the U.S. economy as it relates to the home improvement sector.  As Marvin indicated, the consumer backdrop remains favorable, as we are confident that home improvement demand will remain strong despite an uptick in interest rates. Historically, when interest rates have risen against a strong economic backdrop, the home improvement sector has delivered solid growth.  During these periods, housing affordability was supported by growth in jobs and personal income, which offset the impact of higher borrowing costs. Today, housing affordability remains above the pre-pandemic average. The market is expecting moderately higher interest rates in the coming quarters. But keep in mind, rates are increasing off historic lows.  Home equity has increased due to rising home prices and consumer savings are about $2.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels, positioning consumers for continued residential investments. Given all these factors, we are expecting another strong year of demand in the home improvement market.  \n Now let me turn to capital allocation. We remain committed to be best-in-class when it comes to our ability to create value for our shareholders through our strong capital allocation program. In 2021, we generated $8 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating results, and we returned $15.1 billion to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. During the fourth quarter, we paid $551 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 16 million shares for $4 billion. This brought the total to $13.1 billion in share repurchases for the year, ahead of our expectations of $12 billion. This reflected better-than-expected financial performance and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders.  \n Capital expenditures were $597 million in the quarter and nearly $1.9 billion for the full year as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives to both drive growth and enhance returns across the business. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR stands at 1.98x, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.75x. As I mentioned at our December 15 investor update, we are planning to return to our leverage target over the next 2 years, driven by our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy.  \n With that, I'd like to turn to the income statement. In the fourth quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.78, an increase of 34% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year. This increase reflected better-than-expected sales growth, improved gross margin rate and favorable SG&A leverage, driven by our productivity initiatives.  In the quarter, sales were $21.3 billion, reflecting a comparable sales increase of 5%. Comparable average ticket increased  9.4% and with higher ticket sales in appliances, flooring and seasonal and outdoor living and 90 basis points of commodity inflation in both lumber and copper. In the quarter, comp transaction count decreased 4.4%, but on a 2-year basis, comp transactions increased 8.9%. We continue to gain traction with our Total Home strategy as reflected in Pro growth of 23% and positive DIY comps on top of extremely strong DIY growth last year.  \n On Lowes.com, sales increased 11.5% in the quarter. U.S. comp sales increased 5.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% on a 2-year basis. We saw acceleration in both our Pro and our DIY comp sales trends from our third quarter performance. By month, our U.S. comparable sales were up 8.1% in November, up 7.4% in December and down 1.3% in January. Recall that we cycled over government stimulus in late December and early January of last year. But looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2019 to 2021, November sales increased 33.8%, December increased 37.4% and January increased 33.9%.  \n Gross margin was 32.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, up 115 basis points from last year. Product margin rate increased 65 basis points, driven by our disciplined pricing and cost management strategies. Improvements in both shrink and credit revenue benefited gross margin by 50 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. These benefits were partially offset by roughly 30 basis points of pressure related to higher transportation and importation costs, as well as the expansion of our supply chain network.  I'd like to spend just a moment addressing the recent increase in lumber prices. We are confident that we have an effective strategy to carefully manage our inventory and rapidly adjust pricing. Although we are planning for our lumber margins to be compressed when prices decline, we are confident in our outlook for gross margin rate to be up slightly in 2022.  \n Turning to SG&A. We levered 15 basis points versus LY,  driven by higher sales and our relentless focus on productivity. This quarter, we incurred $50 million of COVID-related expenses as compared to $165 million of COVID-related expenses last year. This reduction in these expenses generated 60 basis points of SG&A leverage.  Additionally, we incurred $150 million of expenses related to the U.S. stores reset in the fourth quarter of last year. As we did not incur any material expenses related to this project in '21, this generated approximately 75 basis points of SG&A leverage versus LY.  These benefits were pressured by 100 basis points related to the discretionary year-end bonus of $215 million for our store-based frontline associates.  Operating profit was over $1.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of 21% versus LY.  Operating margin of 8.7% for the quarter increased 115 basis points over last year, largely driven by higher gross margin rate, as well as favorable SG&A leverage. The effective tax rate was 25.3% in the quarter, which is in line with prior year.  At year-end, inventory was $17.6 billion, up $920 million from Q3 and in line with seasonal trends and consistent with our effort to land spring products earlier. Driven by both improved operating performance and a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we delivered return on invested capital of 35% for the year, up 760 basis points from 2020.  \n Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook. We closed out 2021 ahead of the expectations that we presented at our December 15 investor update. Month-to-date, February, U.S. comparable sales trends are in line with our fourth quarter performance on a 2-year basis. And based on the continued momentum that we are seeing in Pro sales, as well as higher expectations for commodity inflation, we are raising our sales outlook for 2022 to a range of between $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%.  \n Now please keep in mind that our outlook assumes that lumber pricing will return to a more normalized level in the second half of the year. We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY in 2022. Keep in mind that we are cycling over an estimated 300 basis points of stimulus in the first quarter. Also, as a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales.  We now expect gross margin rate in 2022 to be up slightly as compared to the prior year. With higher projected sales, improving gross margin outlook and continued execution of our PPI initiatives, we are raising our outlook for operating margin to a range of 12.8% to 13% from a prior range of 12.5% to 12.8% for the full year. We are also raising our outlook for diluted earnings per share to a range of $13.10 to $13.60 from a prior range of $12.25 to $13.  In 2022, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $12 billion. Finally, we are raising our outlook for return on invested capital to above 36% from our original outlook of approximately 35%.  In closing, we are off to a great start in 2022. We have significant runway ahead of us to both grow our market share, expand operating margins and deliver meaningful long-term shareholder value.  \n And with that, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if you could maybe talk a little bit more about inflation, how you're viewing inflation as part of the comp sales guide for 2022. \nDavid Denton: Yes. Kate, thank you for the question. As we think about next year, if you look at our guide of down 1 to up 1, we would expect units to be modestly down and our average ticket offsetting that almost dollar for dollar. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And based on what you said about February, it does seem like there may have been an acceleration from what you saw in January into February on a 1 year. Is it right that you're seeing better trends in February than January? Should we really just be thinking about things on a 2-year stack? \nDavid Denton: Kate, it is true, we are seeing better trends in February than January. But on a 2-year basis, you need to think about it, our trends in February, consistent with the 2-year trends for the fourth quarter, which is really solid. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: On the Pro side, in the past, you've talked about it as being anywhere between 22% and 25%. Your orange competitor yesterday bumped there, talk of what the Pro is to 50%. They used to say somewhere in the low to mid-40s. I understand that it's hard to get the exact number, but any update on what you think on an annual basis the Pro penetration is? And then more importantly, what do you think it can get to? \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. Look, I think your first statement is directionally correct on what and where the penetration is. We just know the business continues to be very strong. If you think about 23% comps in the quarter and 54% on a 2-year basis, I mean, we feel great about that business. And I think you noted, we spent quite a bit of time over the last 3-plus years making not only investments in adding products to our assortment, but also our service levels fulfillment.  And we're very pleased, as I mentioned in my prepared comments with the launch of our new Pro loyalty program.  And as I mentioned as well, we're seeing a 300% increase in Pro sales for Pros engaged in our loyalty and credit program. And so Pro is going to be a significant part of our growth this year, and we still feel very encouraged by the progress. \nMichael Baker: Okay. And as a follow-up, DIY, you said up on strong gains last year, fair to say up in the low single digits, slightly up something in that range, just what the math suggests? \nDavid Denton: That's correct. We saw expansion in growth in both, obviously, the Pro, but importantly, the DIY as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on EBIT margin. Now that it looks like you could get to 13% in '22. If you look at the model in the out years, and I know you haven't really given anything past this, is the correct way to think about moving past 13%, it's productivity-driven, meaning it's all throughput as sales per foot keeps rising? \nDavid Denton: Yes, I think that is correct. Simeon, we're excited about in December to come back as a complete management team and really outline the building blocks for our progression above and beyond our 13% level as we think about our EBIT margins. But yes, I think about productivity as the main driver of that, as we continue to lean into both the Pro business, as well as healthy growth in our DIY business. \nSimeon Gutman: And my follow-up is on inventory. There's been -- there's this big divergence in Q4 now between you and Home Depot. And if we try adjusting to see if there's a catch-up, it doesn't look like it's the case. And so I guess, Marvin, when you got to Lowe's, I think it was the first and maybe even the second spring where you put Lowe's on the offensive in terms of inventory. So the question for you is, are you pleased with what you've bought so far? And are you pleased with the visibility of what's coming in for this spring and even for the year? \nMarvin Ellison: Short answer is, absolutely. I give a lot of credit to Bill and the merchant team, Don Frieson and the supply chain team for working in a very collaborative fashion to make sure that not only are we fully good about what we have from a product category, but also the quality of the inventory. And as Dave mentioned in his prepared comments, the coastal holding facilities that we established on both the East and Western Coast have given us the ability to land import product early, take possession of it, which on a temporary basis, will elevate inventory levels, but we feel that's a prudent thing to do to make sure that we have that product available out of that global supply chain, so we can get it to our RDCs and our stores.  But we do feel good about where we are. We feel good about the investments we've made in job like [ qualities ] with Pros. And we think headed in the spring, which, as you know, is a significant sales period for us, we're in really good shape. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. \nScot Ciccarelli: Obviously, business is still exceptional but what kind of impact are you projecting from higher interest rates on the housing market? And what is your framework for those projections? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Scot, kind of in my prepared remarks, we talked about that interest rates do have an impact to some degree. But if you go back and historically look at periods of time when interest rates have risen, at the same time, we had really good economic backdrop. Actually, the home improvement sector has benefited from that. And I think if you cycle into '22, you see that same kind of economic climate now. So we feel like the demand profile of the sector is really healthy, number one.  And number two, many of the efforts that we're embarking upon and actually beginning to gain some traction, we're going to actually disproportionately take share in the marketplace. So we feel like we're really nicely positioned to deliver a really solid '22 and think about the future growth of this business in a really healthy manner. \nMarvin Ellison: Scot, this is Marvin. Just one point to add. I do think that home improvement oftentimes gets combined with home building relative to interest rates. And obviously, the sectors are entirely different. And I think that we look at historically, that's why I think Dave's comments are so important that historical trends will show convincingly that high interest rates, combined with other positive macro indicators, do not have a negative impact on home improvement. Now home buying, I'm sure it's a totally different equation, but we want to make sure that there's a line of delineation between the 2 sectors. \nScot Ciccarelli: So just to be clear, guys. So there -- at this point, there's no assumed degradation in sales trends because of higher interest rates? \nDavid Denton: That's correct. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Can I just -- can you just delve into the factors a bit more about what's driving the increase in the comp outlook in 2022? So to what extent are you expecting a higher level of market growth versus what you laid out in December? To what extent are you assuming more share gains? And then how does that compare to your expectations on price inflation and how lumber will play out? \nDavid Denton: Yes. I think there's really 3 things that are driving our increase in our guide from a top line perspective. One is we do think the market is going to perform a bit better. And by the way, we still think we're going to -- and believe and plan for us outpacing the market from a growth perspective. Secondly, we are seeing higher levels of commodity inflation than what we planned back in December, largely in lumber. So that is ticking our sales progression up slightly in the first half of the year. And then third, we're seeing really strong sustainable performance in our Pro business. And that demand has been really consistent through Q4 and we're leaning into Q1 in a very consistent manner -- in healthy manner from a Pro business perspective. \nMarvin Ellison: Chris, I'm going to just add a little commentary on the Pro business, this is Marvin. We did a cost survey stated Pro that we issued out publicly. And just a couple of interesting data points. When we talk to Pros and DIY customers, both said that they see continued investment in the home. The DIY, I said at a pace of 50% today, we're going to do DIY projects and a roughly 50% say they would hire Pro. And then when you talk to our Pro customers, we have in detail, they continue to let us know that their book of business is more robust than they've ever seen it. They have projects lined out for balance of this year. Some projects may carry over into '23. And health of that business is very strong. And I think all the investments that we made in our merchandise assortments, in our service levels, in our stores, in our supply chain is driving that business. Again, 2-year comp in Pro is 54%, that's pretty good. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then can you also talk about the gross margin a little bit, the shrink and the credit performance were quite strong and gross margin came in better than expected. How do these sort of proceed into 2022? And what's elevating your gross margin outlook relative to what you talked about in December? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Listen, I think first and foremost, we're just extremely pleased with the performance from a shrink perspective. I think the store teams and the loss prevention teams have just done an excellent job of managing that. And now it's becoming a bit of a tailwind for us as opposed to a headwind, which was historic.  I think as we lean into '22, think about a few things happening.  \n In general, for the full year, we expect the gross margin to be up slightly, product margin to really lead the charge there as we really manage pricing costs very effectively. Our shrink and credit programs, think about that was largely neutral to our performance versus '22 versus '21. And then we'll have a little bit of headwind as we think about both rates and supply chain and our continued build out in the supply chain ecosystem. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Marvin, I think you mentioned earlier today that about half of Lowe's sales growth in the second half of last year was due to product inflation. Home Depot mentioned yesterday they got around 800 basis points of comp benefit from product inflation. At what point does the consumer start to push back or the industry experience an elastic response from all the inflation that's being passed through, especially as there's a return to normalcy, mobility increases and the interest in other categories shift on a return to normalcy? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, Michael, look, I'll give you just a more of a philosophical perspective based on the trends that we see. So we are very confident that there are certain trends that will sustain. You have millennial household formation trends that are much more robust than any of us had anticipated pre pandemic. You're also seeing the investments in the home that will maintain simply because there are so many millions of people working from home permanently that even as we hope and pray the pandemic will dissipate, you still will have millions of people who permanently work from home that's going to drive certain investments in repair and maintenance that we think will [ sustain going past ] 2022.  \n And the work that the merchants and the finance team has done to drive cost out and to make sure that whatever price increase is driven by inflation we are pushing toward our customers, we're still doing that at a very competitive price because we're taking a multitude of actions to ensure that we're trying to drive other factors of cost out. Look, you know this, I think we're one of the only large retailers that reported -- that's reporting an increase in gross margin for the quarter and for the year from a basis points standpoint. And also we're guiding that for the balance of '22, we're going to see gross margin rate continue to improve. That gives you an indication that we have some degree of confidence we can manage this. I'll let Dave provide more of the financial specifics on kind of what we've seen and what we see going forward. \nDavid Denton: Yes, Michael, I would just add that -- to Marvin's comments here, we really put in a very robust  process and analytical tools around this, such that we're measuring and monitoring as we take increases from a cost perspective. First, we push back on that when appropriate. We take a portfolio approach to adjusting our pricing and then we measure and monitor the performance from a unit velocity perspective. And we adjust as needed, when we need to do that such that we get the best price point from a consumable perspective, but importantly, what also drives the economic value here at Lowe's. \nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is Lowe's has some very interesting initiatives that are either in the early stages or just about to launch, most notably the supply chain transformation and the launch of the Pro loyalty program. So could you give a breakdown of the financial impact that you've seen from both of those programs as you've tested them and then what you factored in as far as the contribution from each of those in the year ahead? \nDavid Denton: Well, maybe I'll take the contribution. Just from a planning perspective, these programs are well planned and well thought out. We have a substantial financial model associated with that. We test and learn as we go. And so we have a -- we feel like our plan for 2022, we have a very good line of sight to performance being driven out of those 2 programs. So first and foremost, we kind of checked that box. And then I'll let Marvin chat about the programs you like. \nMarvin Ellison: No, look, I'll just repeat what I said on the Pro. We tested a loyalty program. All of 2021, we've made different tweaks to it based on feedback and surveys from our Pro customers. We feel like we have a program that's going to drive differentiation and adoption. And as I mentioned, when customers engage in the Pro loyalty and our credit program, we're seeing a 300% increase in sales. And then we think that we're going to see some level of retention and engagement with our Pro customers based on the loss that will be happening within the next couple of weeks. So again, excited about the test and learn environment we've created. And to Dave's point, I mean we put a lot of robust processing in place to ensure that we have good visibility to what we think each of these programs will deliver. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. \nSteven Zaccone: I had a question on the DIY side of the business. So it sounds like most of the guidance raise is contemplated on the Pro and then commodity inflation. But can you comment if your DIY outlook has changed in 2022? And then larger picture on DIY, there's a thesis we'll eventually see a give back of spending in the category, but it seems to still be accelerating as of late and is still strong. What are you seeing in terms of purchase activity or project sizes from your customers that gives you confidence in the sustained strength in DIY? \nMarvin Ellison: Steve, thanks for the question. Our DIY sales were very, very strong in 2020. So year-over-year, we had tough comparison, we were able to grow that business even on top of some really aggressive sales last year. One of the things that we're leaning into as part of our Total Home strategy is private brands. And private brands specifically in the core-related categories. I'm going to let Bill Boltz talk a little bit about what we're leaning in there and how we believe that, that's going to give us some level of continued growth and differentiation. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And just a little more color around the DIY business. I think as we head into spring, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we talked about a couple of key private brands that will play a big role in the spring with the Origin 21, which we're excited about that. That's a new modern brand. So you'll see it introduced in patio. You'll see it in some of decor categories in our stores. And then allen + roth, we've worked really hard over the last 18 months to enhance that brand. And so that's more of a traditional style. And so that will play a big role as well.  \n And then we're really excited about the expansion of STAINMASTER. STAINMASTER, as you know, we acquired a year ago. It was largely a carpet brand, but we have opportunities to use that in other categories in flooring, really building off of its characteristics. And then along the same lines, as we look into the spring season, our live goods and nursery business very strong, has been on a really nice run over the last couple of years, and that plays a large role in our DIY business as we go into spring as well. So we're really -- we're optimistic around the DIY business as we had in the first half of the year. \nMarvin Ellison: And Steve, we're students of history, and we know that one of the strategic mistakes historically at Lowe's was to overcompensate and over-penetrate in private brands in Pro-related categories. And so Bill and his team have been very, very specific to continue to lean in to national brands on the Pro side. But on the DIY side, specifically home decor, the customers are telling us overwhelmingly that they love our design capabilities of private brand. And so we're going to lean into that for differentiation and also for a margin rate benefit. And again, we think we're off to a great start. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. \nElizabeth Lane: How much market share do you think you've taken in the last 3 years? And if the supply chain disruptions normalize and some of your smaller competitors are able to get product again, do you see some of those share gains moderating? \nMarvin Ellison: Liz, it's a fair question. But I will repeat what I've said a couple of different times. Home improvement does not have great market share data that we can glean very specific answers to. What I can tell you based on just our on-the-ground analysis is that we are, in fact, taking market share. It's hard to grow a business this size by over 35% on a 2-year basis and it's not coming from somebody.  We also are aware that there are winners and losers in retail based on the efficiency of your supply chain. We are fortunate that we are one of the largest importers of containers. And we have great supplier relationships that the merchants continue to foster. So do we believe that we're winning? We do. Do we think we'll continue to take market share in 2022? As Dave said earlier, we absolutely believe we will. And we think we'll take it across Pro and on -- and DIY, both in-store and online. But again, it's hard to give you a lot of specificity because the data set is not [indiscernible]. \nDavid Denton: And Liz, but from our internal data, we continue to -- our data suggests that we're performing 200 to 300 basis points ahead of the market pretty consistently. And that will be our expectations going forward as well to outperform the market. \nElizabeth Lane: Great. And just, I mean, how much do you think that the expansion into home decor and new product categories increases your total addressable market? \nMarvin Ellison: It's a great question. We can only go by the feedback that we receive from our customers when we do surveys and we do different types of focus groups and what they are telling us is that they are more brand-agnostic when it comes to home decor-related categories and they are more concerned with quality and good style and price. And what Bill and his team has done with the launch of Origin 21 and with the continued improvement in allen + roth as an example, gives us a lot of confidence and we're really excited about STAINMASTER.  \n As Bill mentioned, you're going to see it going into more hard-surface flooring, but we have some other really exciting ideas that we'll be sharing over the next couple of quarters, but we're going to extend this very, very recognizable and high-quality brand in the other home improvement categories that customers, I think, will be very excited about. \nDavid Denton: Rob, we're going to take one more question, please. \nOperator: The final question will be coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. \nEric Bosshard: Two things, if I could. First of all, the last 2 years have been relatively unique in terms of pricing and promotion and mix with a pretty aggressive consumer and Pro customer. As you think about '22, and it sounds like you think '22 kind of largely feels like the last couple of years, is your strategy the same with pricing, promotion and mix? Or do those efforts normalize a bit towards what we had seen historically? \nDavid Denton: Eric, I think they're going to be fairly consistent. Our plan is fairly consistent in '22 versus '21.  And -- but I'll let Bill comment on that, too. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes, Eric, it's Bill. And so as you know, over the last couple of years, we've been on this journey of getting to more of an everyday competitive price and trying to wind down what has historically been here a very high low approach to marketing and promotion. And we've very successfully been able to do that. And that's now given us the runway to continue to provide value in a number of different ways to our consumers, both through special buys, special values, unique offerings. And so that's the journey we're on and that's what we're excited about. But being able to get off of that, what historically high-low approach allows us to be in this everyday competitive price in the home improvement business and that's what we wanted to be on. \nEric Bosshard: Okay. And then secondly, within the guide for '22, which I think you spoke to negative units and price offsetting that to get to comp dollar growth, haven't had a negative unit plan or outlook in quite some time for your business. I'm curious how you'd marry that up then with your inventory strategy and also with how you manage labor specifically in terms of the investment or the growth in both of those areas in a year where the outlook is reasonably for negative units? \nMarvin Ellison: So Eric, I'll take the first part of it, and I'm going to let Joe just talk a little bit about how our new labor system allows us to make real-time adjustments by store, by department based on ticket and transaction. You have to understand that one of the reasons why you're going to see negative units is because the DIY customer in the heart of the pandemic made types of purchases that they're not going to make in an era where there is less concern around the virus and less nesting at home. \n We had cleaning purchases that drove a lot of transactions, not a lot of ticket. We had a lot of garden purchases and drove a lot of transactions, not a lot of tickets because people were at home and they were staying busy. Categories like paint, a lot of activity, not a lot of ticket. And so as we normalize year-over-year, we've got to see those activities are not sustainable. So when we say that the ticket is not as though we believe that we're seeing less customer traffic, we're just seeing DIY customers have different projects than they had when they were confined to their homes and staying busy with just random different projects around the house. \n And that's the difference. So when we look at that, we just made it really transparent around how we view the inputs to what's driving sales. And we have no concerns that we're having a traffic issue or we have a customer demand issue. This is just more normalizing over unique activity in the middle of the pandemic. So I'll let Joe talk about our labor system and how we can manage it based on all those inputs. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Marvin. And Eric, you remember just a few years ago, we put together just a topnotch workforce management team, and we developed a labor model that is activity based. So this labor model has served us well as sales have taken off and exceeded expectations from an appropriate leverage standpoint and does the same in balancing out the ticket and transaction. We're very pleased with our staffing and our outlook for '22. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May. \nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone.  Our results once again beat expectations this quarter, with comparable sales up 5% for the total company and 5.1% for the U.S. on top of over 28% growth last year. This resulted in comp sales of 34.5% for the total company and up 35.2% for the U.S. on a 2-year basis. These results capped of outstanding financial results for fiscal 2021 with sales of $96.3 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable basis and earnings per share of $12.04, up 36% on an adjusted basis.  \n With these outstanding results, 100% of our stores earned a quarterly Winning Together profit-sharing bonus. This $94 million payout is $24 million above the target payment level. And in recognition for their hard work throughout the pandemic in 2021, we are awarding an incremental discretionary bonus of $265 million to our frontline associates. Altogether, we rewarded our frontline associates with bonuses of over $350 million in the fourth quarter. As Joe will discuss later in the call, financial support of our frontline associates is consistent with our commitment to being an employer of choice in the retail industry.  Our Total Home strategy continues to gain momentum, as we grow our share of wallet with both Pro and DIY as they increasingly rely on Lowe's as a one-stop solution for all their project needs. In looking at our results this quarter, I'm particularly encouraged that our growth was broad based and balanced across product categories, across both DIY and Pro, both online and in-store.  \n In Pro, we delivered growth of 23% and 54% on a 2-year basis. And we are building on our momentum with the Pro with the launch of our new Pro loyalty program, MVPs Pro Rewards  and Partnership Program.  We redesigned our loyalty program based on feedback from our Pro customers who expressed a desire for a business partnership rather than a series of stand-alone transactions. Our data shows that Pros who leverage our loyalty and credit offering spend 300% more than Pros not engaged in these programs. Our Pro business is off to a strong start this year, and we're excited about the national launch of our MVPs Pro loyalty program.  I look forward to providing updates on this critical initiative throughout the year.  Now turning to our DIY customer, where we delivered growth on top of exceptionally strong demand last year. Later in the call, Bill will discuss how we continue to grow our DIY market share by elevating our private brands product assortments in our home decor category.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 11.5% on top of 121% growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a 2-year comp of 147% and nearly 11% sales penetration. Our intuitive online shopping experience and expanded on-trend assortments are resonating with our customers. And while we're pleased that our online sales have more than doubled over the past 2 years, we still have tremendous growth opportunity in front of us. And as part of our efforts to enhance our omnichannel experience, we are expanding our same-day and next-day fulfillment capabilities.  \n With that in mind, we're actively piloting several gig network solutions, including partnering with Instacart in several markets with same-day DIY home delivery. And building on the success we gained in the Florida and Ohio Valley regions with our market delivery strategy, we completed the conversion of our third geographic area, the Carolina region, during the fourth quarter. By way of reminder, in the market-based delivery model, big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers' homes. This replaces the highly inefficient store delivery model where each store acts as its own distribution and transportation center for these products.  As we continue to expand our market-based delivery model, we're freeing up space in our 10,000 square foot store back rooms,  which on average are considerably larger than our competition. And we are testing out different options to drive both greater in-store fulfillment and expanded delivery alternatives for both Pro and DIY customers. In a few minutes, Bill will discuss our continued investments in online as we create a best-in-class integrated omnichannel shopping experience.  \n During the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 115 basis points, leading to diluted earnings per share of $1.78, which is a 34% increase as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year. These results reflect our disciplined focus on driving operating leverage through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI, as well as the ongoing benefits of our new pricing strategies. Joe and Dave will discuss these initiatives in further detail later in the call.  Turning to our results in Canada where performance lagged the U.S. The Canadian leadership team continues to drive productivity through proven technology and processes that have delivered great results in the U.S.  Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market, as well as our opportunity to continue to win share. Our outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong, supported by a very healthy consumer balance sheet, especially for homeowners and continuing home price appreciation. Persistent solid demand for homes despite an uptick in interest rates is also expected to support residential investment. In fact, we're encouraged by the strengthening millennial household formation trends that will support home buying in the coming years.  \n Other trends remain favorable, including baby boomers' increasing preference to-age-in-place.  And with the extension of remote work for some employees, we're expecting a permanent step-up in repair and maintenance cycle. And as a reminder, 50% of the homes in the U.S. are over 40 years old and will continue to require investments for upkeep and approximately 2/3 of Lowe's annual sales are generated from repair and maintenance activity. Therefore, we're encouraged that the macro environment for home improvement remains very supportive.  \n As we close the year, we continue to give back to the communities where we operate, with total donations of $100 million in 2021 well over our pre-pandemic levels. And we're pleased that our efforts to enhance our brand reputation while supporting our associates and driving long-term value for our shareholders and was recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as they named Lowe's the #1 Most Admired Specialty Retailer for the second year in a row. This is the first time in our history that we received this recognition in back-to-back years.  \n In closing, I'd like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our frontline associates. As I travel the country every week visiting stores, I continue to be struck by their commitment to supporting our communities while providing excellent customer service.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Yes. Look, I think your first statement is directionally correct on what and where the penetration is. We just know the business continues to be very strong. If you think about 23% comps in the quarter and 54% on a 2-year basis, I mean, we feel great about that business. And I think you noted, we spent quite a bit of time over the last 3-plus years making not only investments in adding products to our assortment, but also our service levels fulfillment.  And we're very pleased, as I mentioned in my prepared comments with the launch of our new Pro loyalty program.  And as I mentioned as well, we're seeing a 300% increase in Pro sales for Pros engaged in our loyalty and credit program. And so Pro is going to be a significant part of our growth this year, and we still feel very encouraged by the progress. Short answer is, absolutely. I give a lot of credit to Bill and the merchant team, Don Frieson and the supply chain team for working in a very collaborative fashion to make sure that not only are we fully good about what we have from a product category, but also the quality of the inventory. And as Dave mentioned in his prepared comments, the coastal holding facilities that we established on both the East and Western Coast have given us the ability to land import product early, take possession of it, which on a temporary basis, will elevate inventory levels, but we feel that's a prudent thing to do to make sure that we have that product available out of that global supply chain, so we can get it to our RDCs and our stores.  But we do feel good about where we are. We feel good about the investments we've made in job like [ qualities ] with Pros. And we think headed in the spring, which, as you know, is a significant sales period for us, we're in really good shape. Scot, this is Marvin. Just one point to add. I do think that home improvement oftentimes gets combined with home building relative to interest rates. And obviously, the sectors are entirely different. And I think that we look at historically, that's why I think Dave's comments are so important that historical trends will show convincingly that high interest rates, combined with other positive macro indicators, do not have a negative impact on home improvement. Now home buying, I'm sure it's a totally different equation, but we want to make sure that there's a line of delineation between the 2 sectors. Chris, I'm going to just add a little commentary on the Pro business, this is Marvin. We did a cost survey stated Pro that we issued out publicly. And just a couple of interesting data points. When we talk to Pros and DIY customers, both said that they see continued investment in the home. The DIY, I said at a pace of 50% today, we're going to do DIY projects and a roughly 50% say they would hire Pro. And then when you talk to our Pro customers, we have in detail, they continue to let us know that their book of business is more robust than they've ever seen it. They have projects lined out for balance of this year. Some projects may carry over into '23. And health of that business is very strong. And I think all the investments that we made in our merchandise assortments, in our service levels, in our stores, in our supply chain is driving that business. Again, 2-year comp in Pro is 54%, that's pretty good. Well, Michael, look, I'll give you just a more of a philosophical perspective based on the trends that we see. So we are very confident that there are certain trends that will sustain. You have millennial household formation trends that are much more robust than any of us had anticipated pre pandemic. You're also seeing the investments in the home that will maintain simply because there are so many millions of people working from home permanently that even as we hope and pray the pandemic will dissipate, you still will have millions of people who permanently work from home that's going to drive certain investments in repair and maintenance that we think will [ sustain going past ] 2022.  \n And the work that the merchants and the finance team has done to drive cost out and to make sure that whatever price increase is driven by inflation we are pushing toward our customers, we're still doing that at a very competitive price because we're taking a multitude of actions to ensure that we're trying to drive other factors of cost out. Look, you know this, I think we're one of the only large retailers that reported -- that's reporting an increase in gross margin for the quarter and for the year from a basis points standpoint. And also we're guiding that for the balance of '22, we're going to see gross margin rate continue to improve. That gives you an indication that we have some degree of confidence we can manage this. I'll let Dave provide more of the financial specifics on kind of what we've seen and what we see going forward. No, look, I'll just repeat what I said on the Pro. We tested a loyalty program. All of 2021, we've made different tweaks to it based on feedback and surveys from our Pro customers. We feel like we have a program that's going to drive differentiation and adoption. And as I mentioned, when customers engage in the Pro loyalty and our credit program, we're seeing a 300% increase in sales. And then we think that we're going to see some level of retention and engagement with our Pro customers based on the loss that will be happening within the next couple of weeks. So again, excited about the test and learn environment we've created. And to Dave's point, I mean we put a lot of robust processing in place to ensure that we have good visibility to what we think each of these programs will deliver. Steve, thanks for the question. Our DIY sales were very, very strong in 2020. So year-over-year, we had tough comparison, we were able to grow that business even on top of some really aggressive sales last year. One of the things that we're leaning into as part of our Total Home strategy is private brands. And private brands specifically in the core-related categories. I'm going to let Bill Boltz talk a little bit about what we're leaning in there and how we believe that, that's going to give us some level of continued growth and differentiation. And Steve, we're students of history, and we know that one of the strategic mistakes historically at Lowe's was to overcompensate and over-penetrate in private brands in Pro-related categories. And so Bill and his team have been very, very specific to continue to lean in to national brands on the Pro side. But on the DIY side, specifically home decor, the customers are telling us overwhelmingly that they love our design capabilities of private brand. And so we're going to lean into that for differentiation and also for a margin rate benefit. And again, we think we're off to a great start. Liz, it's a fair question. But I will repeat what I've said a couple of different times. Home improvement does not have great market share data that we can glean very specific answers to. What I can tell you based on just our on-the-ground analysis is that we are, in fact, taking market share. It's hard to grow a business this size by over 35% on a 2-year basis and it's not coming from somebody.  We also are aware that there are winners and losers in retail based on the efficiency of your supply chain. We are fortunate that we are one of the largest importers of containers. And we have great supplier relationships that the merchants continue to foster. So do we believe that we're winning? We do. Do we think we'll continue to take market share in 2022? As Dave said earlier, we absolutely believe we will. And we think we'll take it across Pro and on -- and DIY, both in-store and online. But again, it's hard to give you a lot of specificity because the data set is not [indiscernible]. It's a great question. We can only go by the feedback that we receive from our customers when we do surveys and we do different types of focus groups and what they are telling us is that they are more brand-agnostic when it comes to home decor-related categories and they are more concerned with quality and good style and price. And what Bill and his team has done with the launch of Origin 21 and with the continued improvement in allen + roth as an example, gives us a lot of confidence and we're really excited about STAINMASTER.  \n As Bill mentioned, you're going to see it going into more hard-surface flooring, but we have some other really exciting ideas that we'll be sharing over the next couple of quarters, but we're going to extend this very, very recognizable and high-quality brand in the other home improvement categories that customers, I think, will be very excited about. So Eric, I'll take the first part of it, and I'm going to let Joe just talk a little bit about how our new labor system allows us to make real-time adjustments by store, by department based on ticket and transaction. You have to understand that one of the reasons why you're going to see negative units is because the DIY customer in the heart of the pandemic made types of purchases that they're not going to make in an era where there is less concern around the virus and less nesting at home. \n We had cleaning purchases that drove a lot of transactions, not a lot of ticket. We had a lot of garden purchases and drove a lot of transactions, not a lot of tickets because people were at home and they were staying busy. Categories like paint, a lot of activity, not a lot of ticket. And so as we normalize year-over-year, we've got to see those activities are not sustainable. So when we say that the ticket is not as though we believe that we're seeing less customer traffic, we're just seeing DIY customers have different projects than they had when they were confined to their homes and staying busy with just random different projects around the house. \n And that's the difference. So when we look at that, we just made it really transparent around how we view the inputs to what's driving sales. And we have no concerns that we're having a traffic issue or we have a customer demand issue. This is just more normalizing over unique activity in the middle of the pandemic. So I'll let Joe talk about our labor system and how we can manage it based on all those inputs."

            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the U.S. economy as it relates to the home improvement sector.  As Marvin indicated, the consumer backdrop remains favorable, as we are confident that home improvement demand will remain strong despite an uptick in interest rates. Historically, when interest rates have risen against a strong economic backdrop, the home improvement sector has delivered solid growth.  During these periods, housing affordability was supported by growth in jobs and personal income, which offset the impact of higher borrowing costs. Today, housing affordability remains above the pre-pandemic average. The market is expecting moderately higher interest rates in the coming quarters. But keep in mind, rates are increasing off historic lows.  Home equity has increased due to rising home prices and consumer savings are about $2.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels, positioning consumers for continued residential investments. Given all these factors, we are expecting another strong year of demand in the home improvement market.  \n Now let me turn to capital allocation. We remain committed to be best-in-class when it comes to our ability to create value for our shareholders through our strong capital allocation program. In 2021, we generated $8 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating results, and we returned $15.1 billion to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. During the fourth quarter, we paid $551 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 16 million shares for $4 billion. This brought the total to $13.1 billion in share repurchases for the year, ahead of our expectations of $12 billion. This reflected better-than-expected financial performance and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders.  \n Capital expenditures were $597 million in the quarter and nearly $1.9 billion for the full year as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives to both drive growth and enhance returns across the business. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR stands at 1.98x, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.75x. As I mentioned at our December 15 investor update, we are planning to return to our leverage target over the next 2 years, driven by our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy.  \n With that, I'd like to turn to the income statement. In the fourth quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.78, an increase of 34% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year. This increase reflected better-than-expected sales growth, improved gross margin rate and favorable SG&A leverage, driven by our productivity initiatives.  In the quarter, sales were $21.3 billion, reflecting a comparable sales increase of 5%. Comparable average ticket increased  9.4% and with higher ticket sales in appliances, flooring and seasonal and outdoor living and 90 basis points of commodity inflation in both lumber and copper. In the quarter, comp transaction count decreased 4.4%, but on a 2-year basis, comp transactions increased 8.9%. We continue to gain traction with our Total Home strategy as reflected in Pro growth of 23% and positive DIY comps on top of extremely strong DIY growth last year.  \n On Lowes.com, sales increased 11.5% in the quarter. U.S. comp sales increased 5.1% in the fourth quarter and 35.2% on a 2-year basis. We saw acceleration in both our Pro and our DIY comp sales trends from our third quarter performance. By month, our U.S. comparable sales were up 8.1% in November, up 7.4% in December and down 1.3% in January. Recall that we cycled over government stimulus in late December and early January of last year. But looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2019 to 2021, November sales increased 33.8%, December increased 37.4% and January increased 33.9%.  \n Gross margin was 32.9% of sales in the fourth quarter, up 115 basis points from last year. Product margin rate increased 65 basis points, driven by our disciplined pricing and cost management strategies. Improvements in both shrink and credit revenue benefited gross margin by 50 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. These benefits were partially offset by roughly 30 basis points of pressure related to higher transportation and importation costs, as well as the expansion of our supply chain network.  I'd like to spend just a moment addressing the recent increase in lumber prices. We are confident that we have an effective strategy to carefully manage our inventory and rapidly adjust pricing. Although we are planning for our lumber margins to be compressed when prices decline, we are confident in our outlook for gross margin rate to be up slightly in 2022.  \n Turning to SG&A. We levered 15 basis points versus LY,  driven by higher sales and our relentless focus on productivity. This quarter, we incurred $50 million of COVID-related expenses as compared to $165 million of COVID-related expenses last year. This reduction in these expenses generated 60 basis points of SG&A leverage.  Additionally, we incurred $150 million of expenses related to the U.S. stores reset in the fourth quarter of last year. As we did not incur any material expenses related to this project in '21, this generated approximately 75 basis points of SG&A leverage versus LY.  These benefits were pressured by 100 basis points related to the discretionary year-end bonus of $215 million for our store-based frontline associates.  Operating profit was over $1.8 billion in the quarter, an increase of 21% versus LY.  Operating margin of 8.7% for the quarter increased 115 basis points over last year, largely driven by higher gross margin rate, as well as favorable SG&A leverage. The effective tax rate was 25.3% in the quarter, which is in line with prior year.  At year-end, inventory was $17.6 billion, up $920 million from Q3 and in line with seasonal trends and consistent with our effort to land spring products earlier. Driven by both improved operating performance and a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we delivered return on invested capital of 35% for the year, up 760 basis points from 2020.  \n Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook. We closed out 2021 ahead of the expectations that we presented at our December 15 investor update. Month-to-date, February, U.S. comparable sales trends are in line with our fourth quarter performance on a 2-year basis. And based on the continued momentum that we are seeing in Pro sales, as well as higher expectations for commodity inflation, we are raising our sales outlook for 2022 to a range of between $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%.  \n Now please keep in mind that our outlook assumes that lumber pricing will return to a more normalized level in the second half of the year. We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY in 2022. Keep in mind that we are cycling over an estimated 300 basis points of stimulus in the first quarter. Also, as a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales.  We now expect gross margin rate in 2022 to be up slightly as compared to the prior year. With higher projected sales, improving gross margin outlook and continued execution of our PPI initiatives, we are raising our outlook for operating margin to a range of 12.8% to 13% from a prior range of 12.5% to 12.8% for the full year. We are also raising our outlook for diluted earnings per share to a range of $13.10 to $13.60 from a prior range of $12.25 to $13.  In 2022, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $12 billion. Finally, we are raising our outlook for return on invested capital to above 36% from our original outlook of approximately 35%.  In closing, we are off to a great start in 2022. We have significant runway ahead of us to both grow our market share, expand operating margins and deliver meaningful long-term shareholder value.  \n And with that, we are now ready for questions. Yes. Kate, thank you for the question. As we think about next year, if you look at our guide of down 1 to up 1, we would expect units to be modestly down and our average ticket offsetting that almost dollar for dollar. Kate, it is true, we are seeing better trends in February than January. But on a 2-year basis, you need to think about it, our trends in February, consistent with the 2-year trends for the fourth quarter, which is really solid. That's correct. We saw expansion in growth in both, obviously, the Pro, but importantly, the DIY as well. Yes, I think that is correct. Simeon, we're excited about in December to come back as a complete management team and really outline the building blocks for our progression above and beyond our 13% level as we think about our EBIT margins. But yes, I think about productivity as the main driver of that, as we continue to lean into both the Pro business, as well as healthy growth in our DIY business. Yes. Scot, kind of in my prepared remarks, we talked about that interest rates do have an impact to some degree. But if you go back and historically look at periods of time when interest rates have risen, at the same time, we had really good economic backdrop. Actually, the home improvement sector has benefited from that. And I think if you cycle into '22, you see that same kind of economic climate now. So we feel like the demand profile of the sector is really healthy, number one.  And number two, many of the efforts that we're embarking upon and actually beginning to gain some traction, we're going to actually disproportionately take share in the marketplace. So we feel like we're really nicely positioned to deliver a really solid '22 and think about the future growth of this business in a really healthy manner. That's correct. Yes. I think there's really 3 things that are driving our increase in our guide from a top line perspective. One is we do think the market is going to perform a bit better. And by the way, we still think we're going to -- and believe and plan for us outpacing the market from a growth perspective. Secondly, we are seeing higher levels of commodity inflation than what we planned back in December, largely in lumber. So that is ticking our sales progression up slightly in the first half of the year. And then third, we're seeing really strong sustainable performance in our Pro business. And that demand has been really consistent through Q4 and we're leaning into Q1 in a very consistent manner -- in healthy manner from a Pro business perspective. Yes. Listen, I think first and foremost, we're just extremely pleased with the performance from a shrink perspective. I think the store teams and the loss prevention teams have just done an excellent job of managing that. And now it's becoming a bit of a tailwind for us as opposed to a headwind, which was historic.  I think as we lean into '22, think about a few things happening.  \n In general, for the full year, we expect the gross margin to be up slightly, product margin to really lead the charge there as we really manage pricing costs very effectively. Our shrink and credit programs, think about that was largely neutral to our performance versus '22 versus '21. And then we'll have a little bit of headwind as we think about both rates and supply chain and our continued build out in the supply chain ecosystem. Yes, Michael, I would just add that -- to Marvin's comments here, we really put in a very robust  process and analytical tools around this, such that we're measuring and monitoring as we take increases from a cost perspective. First, we push back on that when appropriate. We take a portfolio approach to adjusting our pricing and then we measure and monitor the performance from a unit velocity perspective. And we adjust as needed, when we need to do that such that we get the best price point from a consumable perspective, but importantly, what also drives the economic value here at Lowe's. Well, maybe I'll take the contribution. Just from a planning perspective, these programs are well planned and well thought out. We have a substantial financial model associated with that. We test and learn as we go. And so we have a -- we feel like our plan for 2022, we have a very good line of sight to performance being driven out of those 2 programs. So first and foremost, we kind of checked that box. And then I'll let Marvin chat about the programs you like. And Liz, but from our internal data, we continue to -- our data suggests that we're performing 200 to 300 basis points ahead of the market pretty consistently. And that will be our expectations going forward as well to outperform the market. Rob, we're going to take one more question, please. Eric, I think they're going to be fairly consistent. Our plan is fairly consistent in '22 versus '21.  And -- but I'll let Bill comment on that, too."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.  In the fourth quarter, U.S. comparable sales increased 5.1% and 35.2% on a 2-year basis. We delivered positive comps in all 3 merchandising divisions in the quarter with growth across Pro and DIY customers. Growth was well balanced with 12 of 15 merchandising departments comping positive and was broad-based on a 2-year basis with all 15 departments up more than 18% in that time frame.  \n Beginning with our Home Decor merchandising division, flooring and appliances  delivered the strongest comps in the quarter. In flooring, vinyl flooring once again led the way as we continue to see consumer preference shifting towards this affordable and stylish solution. Lowe's already offers a wide selection of vinyl flooring products, including several Pergo WetProtect options. And this year, we look forward to extending our own trusted STAINMASTER brand with its high performance characteristics and lifetime stain-resistant warranty across a full range of flooring products, including laminate, tile and vinyl.  Within appliances, sales of ranges, cooktops, along with dishwashers were the strongest in the quarter. As we continue to extend our private brand offering, we recently launched Origin 21 across several product categories in home decor. This is our new modern brand designed for the trend-setting millennial consumer, while our ever popular allen + roth brand is tailored to the more traditional style.  \n Now turning to our performance in hardlines. The team delivered an exceptional holiday season. Customers were active early and shopped often in our trim and tree category, which drove excellent sell-through in this holiday category. Seasonal, outdoor living and lawn and garden delivered standout performances, as customers continue to enhance their outdoor living spaces with new grills, patio heaters, fire pits, as well as live goods for the yards and garden. With the home serving as a center for entertainment, our customers are making the most of their homes, inside and out.  \n We continue to build on our #1 position in outdoor power equipment with further share gains in battery outdoor power equipment, as we drove over 37% growth in this area for the quarter and over 118% on a 2-year basis. Both DIY and Pro customers enjoy the convenience, reliability and the power of our innovative battery-powered products available in the EGO, Kobalt,  CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands. In this spring, we are thrilled to expand our exclusive lineup of EGO battery products with their new 52-inch zero-turn riding mower with features that include a fabricated deck and power to mow up to 4 acres on a single charge. Also new for EGO is the industry's most powerful handheld battery-powered blower with power that will outperform the leading gas blower with 765 cubic feet per minute of blowing capacity. These new products will complement our existing lineup and assortments from powerful brands, such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and CRAFTSMAN.  This spring, we will launch our new Origin 21 patio collections, as well as our new style selection replacement cushions. These cushions are made with 100% recycled plastic bottles and they are fade-resistant, UV-protected as well as easy to clean.  \n Now turning to the building products division. Our comps were very strong driven by broad-based balanced growth across lumber, electrical, rough plumbing, millwork and building materials. We are pleased with the continued momentum we are building with the Pro as we work to expand our brand and product offerings to meet their project needs.  \n New this year will be a full range of CertainTeed roofing,  insulation and gypsum products. As a leading manufacturer of building products for both residential and commercial construction, CertainTeed is an important strategic partner that we are proud to add to Lowe's as we continue to enhance our Pro offering in the building materials category.  We also continue to build out our Pro power tool program with the introduction of the new DEWALT power stack battery technology, which is the smallest and most energy-densed battery pack on the market. These new products and new brands are strong additions to our Pro brand arsenal, which already includes other great brands like Bosch, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner. \n Moving to Lowes.com. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered sales growth of 11.5% in the quarter and 147% on a 2-year basis in the fourth quarter. We are focused on further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities in 2022 across 3 key areas: expanding our online assortment; enhancing the user experience; and improving fulfillment.  First, we are expanding our Lowes.com assortment to meet our customers' design and lifestyle needs. For example, within Lowe's Livable Home products, we will offer a range of products to help our customers adapt to their changing mobility needs. At the same time, we will continue to enhance the user experience with continued upgrades to the visualization and configuration tools, like kitchen visualizer and Measure Your Space. \n Finally, as we continue to improve our fulfillment capabilities, our customers can now track their appliance delivery in real time, and we will soon be leveraging enhanced technology to further streamline the buy online, pick-up in store experience for our customers through an improved store execution process.  As we look ahead to spring, we are well positioned to capitalize on what we expect to be another strong spring season. Consistent with our approach over the past year, we have worked hard to land our spring product early. Through an expansion of our network of coastal holding facilities,  we are better able to manage the flow of imported product enabling us to quickly flow product where needed as spring arrives across the country.  As one of the largest importers in the U.S., we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and work to mitigate and manage the impact of cost increases across our supply chain.  Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our merchants and inventory and supply chain teams, along with our vendors for their hard work and continued support.  \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And just a little more color around the DIY business. I think as we head into spring, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we talked about a couple of key private brands that will play a big role in the spring with the Origin 21, which we're excited about that. That's a new modern brand. So you'll see it introduced in patio. You'll see it in some of decor categories in our stores. And then allen + roth, we've worked really hard over the last 18 months to enhance that brand. And so that's more of a traditional style. And so that will play a big role as well.  \n And then we're really excited about the expansion of STAINMASTER. STAINMASTER, as you know, we acquired a year ago. It was largely a carpet brand, but we have opportunities to use that in other categories in flooring, really building off of its characteristics. And then along the same lines, as we look into the spring season, our live goods and nursery business very strong, has been on a really nice run over the last couple of years, and that plays a large role in our DIY business as we go into spring as well. So we're really -- we're optimistic around the DIY business as we had in the first half of the year. Yes, Eric, it's Bill. And so as you know, over the last couple of years, we've been on this journey of getting to more of an everyday competitive price and trying to wind down what has historically been here a very high low approach to marketing and promotion. And we've very successfully been able to do that. And that's now given us the runway to continue to provide value in a number of different ways to our consumers, both through special buys, special values, unique offerings. And so that's the journey we're on and that's what we're excited about. But being able to get off of that, what historically high-low approach allows us to be in this everyday competitive price in the home improvement business and that's what we wanted to be on."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for delivering tremendous results in 2021. In recognition of their outstanding efforts, we awarded the discretionary year-end bonus of $6,000 for assistant store managers, $1,000 for department supervisors, $800 for full-time hourly associates and $400 for part-time hourly associates. As Marvin mentioned, the combination of Winning Together and this discretionary year-end bonus will result in a payout of over $350 million for our frontline associates this quarter.  As someone who started his career in home improvement as an hourly associate, I understand how meaningful this type of financial recognition is for our hourly associates. At Lowe's, our people are truly our most valuable asset. When it comes to recruiting and retaining top talent, we strive to be an employer of choice.  From the moment that a candidate applies for a position at Lowe's, we are committed to creating a positive impression. We have invested in leading technology that accelerates the hiring process, so that we are processing applications in a matter of minutes rather than the weeks that the manual process required as recently as last year.  We also continue to improve our onboarding process so that our new hires can quickly come up to speed, leveraging the technology and product knowledge that is readily available to them on their handheld mobile devices via the Lowe's University application. As I mentioned on our last call, we are also leveraging our new Lowe's University in-store training labs to provide the ongoing training that our associates need to build their skills and confidence so they can continue to progress in their career.  \n Over the last 3 years, we have created valuable career opportunities for our associates with the incremental 10,000 department supervisor roles and 1,600 ASM positions that we have added. Since 2018, we have also invested well over $2 billion in incremental wage and equity programs for our frontline associates to ensure that we continue to offer a strong competitive wage and benefit package to our associates.  I'm really pleased to report that our investments to position Lowe's as an employer of choice are paying off. Heading into spring, we anticipate being even better positioned than last year from a hiring perspective. And we are also confident that we will continue to drive productivity in our operations through our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives.  \n As a reminder, this is not a single win. It is a series of improvements that are scaling across our stores over time. In fact, we are working on over 20 different PPI initiatives in our store operations this year. To highlight just a few key PPI initiatives, we have just launched a new store inventory management system, or SIMs across all of our stores. This platform gives store associates real-time visibility to inventory in their store. This includes inventory in the home bay location as well as product in the top stock and cap, off-shelf and back stock room.  This new system will eliminate the countless nonproductive hours associates have been spending looking for product.  \n I'm also excited about our continuing efforts to eliminate the ancient green screen technology with the launch of our simplified user interface to other selling stations throughout the store. First introduced at our front-end registers, we are beginning to implement this new technology across the sales floor. With this new platform, we are accelerating the associate training process and facilitating cross-training in other departments. This new technology will free up our associates to focus on providing excellent customer service while reducing customer wait time.  While these 2 initiatives are just a few of the PPI deliverables planned for this year, we expect that these 2 initiatives alone will drive $100 million in productivity this year. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage technology to reduce manual tasking for our associates while also enabling them to deliver better service to our Pro and DIY customers.  I would like to close once again by thanking our store associates for their continued hard work and dedication and the great results we achieved together this year. With that, I will turn it over to Dave. Thanks, Marvin. And Eric, you remember just a few years ago, we put together just a topnotch workforce management team, and we developed a labor model that is activity based. So this labor model has served us well as sales have taken off and exceeded expectations from an appropriate leverage standpoint and does the same in balancing out the ticket and transaction. We're very pleased with our staffing and our outlook for '22."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe's Companies Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Darryl, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Dave Denton, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2021. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.  \n Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in this morning's press release in our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. \n I'd like to begin by taking a moment to extend my thoughts and prayers to those who are impacted by the ongoing pandemic as well as the many wildfires. At Lowe's, we remain committed to the health and safety of our associates and customers while supporting the communities in which we operate. The resilience of our customers and our associates is something that I admire on a daily basis.  \n Now turning to our results. We are very pleased with the performance for the second quarter. During the quarter, comparable sales declined 1.6% for the total company and 2.2% for the U.S. And on a 2-year basis, comp sales were positive 32% for the total company and for the U.S. Our outstanding 2-year performance was driven by great execution of our Total Home strategy, which allowed us to win with both the Pro and DIY customers while meeting the aggressive growth demands across Pro, Lowes.com and our Installation Services business. \n As anticipated, during the quarter, we saw a decline in DIY demand versus last year as many families transition back to pre-COVID purchase patterns and weekend mobility after Memorial Day. But because of the agility of our Total Home strategy, we were able to capitalize on Pro demand driving growth of 21% this quarter and 49% on a 2-year basis. \n This level of Pro growth would not have been possible without our intense focus on the Pro customer over the past 24 months. This intense Pro focus includes our U.S. stores reset project that we executed last year. This reset has allowed us to create a more intuitive store layout for the Pro aligned across product adjacencies, so Pros can quickly and easily locate all products they need for their jobs. \n And as a reminder, our core Pro customer is a small- to medium-sized business owner. These customers shop frequently across the store, impacting numerous product categories.  And as we continue to capture more of their spend, we will continue to increase productivity across the top and bottom line of our stores. Later in the call, Bill will discuss how we will continue to expand our Pro product offerings and then Joe will discuss our enhanced online experience for the Pro.  \n We also delivered double-digit growth this quarter in our Installation Services. We continue to expand the products available for installation, and we're leveraging our enhanced e-commerce platform and our revamped business model to deliver a better customer experience. We expect our Installation Services business to continue to play an important role in our Total Home strategy as customers increasingly look to us to provide an end-to-end turnkey solution for their home project needs.  \n And at Lowes.com, sales grew 7% on top of 135% growth in the second quarter of 2020, which represents a 9% sales penetration this quarter and a 2-year comp of 151%. Our enhanced omnichannel offering continues to resonate with our customers who increasingly expect total flexibility in shopping however, whenever and wherever they choose.  \n We're also pleased with the performance of our Canadian business. In the second quarter, Canada delivered comp growth in line with the U.S. despite several COVID-related operating restrictions. We also continued to elevate our product offering, which is another pillar of our Total Home strategy as we help fulfill the aspirations of our customers to upgrade their homes and style.  And we delivered strong positive comps across kitchen and bath, flooring, appliances and decor on top of 20% growth in these categories last year. The 17% growth we experienced in ticket over $500 was in large part driven by these categories, reflecting continued consumer confidence in investing in their homes. This also reinforces the consumers' confidence in Lowe's as the right destination for their home decor needs.  \n And during the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 80 basis points leading to diluted earnings per share of $4.25, which is a 13% increase as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year. In the face of unprecedented lumber price volatility during the second quarter, our improved operating performance reflects the benefits of our new price management system along with our disciplined focus on perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI. Bill and Joe will discuss both these initiatives in more detail later in the call.  \n I'd now like to take a moment to discuss a very important milestone in the company's transformation. When I joined Lowe's as CEO back in July of 2018, I discussed the importance of transforming and modernizing our supply chain. The foundation of this transformation is transitioning the company from a store-based delivery model to a market-based delivery model for big and bulky products. \n I'm pleased to announce that this quarter, we completed the conversion of our Florida region to a market-based delivery model for appliances and other big and bulky items like grills, riding lawn mowers and select patio furniture. In this new delivery model, product flows from the bulk distribution centers to cross-dock terminals directly to customers' homes, bypassing the stores altogether. This replaces a legacy store delivery model where we hold appliances in stockrooms and storage containers behind our stores and then leverage store-based trucks and associates to deliver these products to customers' homes. \n To say this legacy process is inefficient would be an extreme understatement. The new market-based delivery model is already driving higher appliance sales, improved profitability, lower inventory, higher on-time delivery rates and improved customer satisfaction. And we're freeing up space in our stockrooms, which will enable us to expand our same-day and next-day Pro and DIY fulfillment capabilities in the near future.  \n We plan to roll out the market-based delivery model across additional regions by the end of the year and then complete the rollout across the U.S. over the next 18-plus months. With this new delivery model, we will continue to drive sales, inventory turns and operating leverage through a technology-driven, simplify and customer-centric process.  \n Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market as well as Lowe's opportunity to win in this market. The outlook for the home improvement industry remains very positive. Residential investment is expected to remain high due to historically low mortgage rates while home prices continue to appreciate.  We're also pleased that we continue to see higher household formation trends and longer-term wallet share shift to the home. \n It's also worth noting that any near-term pressures on housing turnover is not related to an economic downturn as typical. In fact, there is more housing demand than supply, resulting in home prices continuing to rise. And because of this, consumers have an increased confidence in repairing and remodeling their homes.  As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of Lowe's annual sales are generated from repair and maintenance activity. \n Further, our research shows that it will take years for the supply of homes to meet the projected demand. This remains a very positive indicator for home improvement. In addition, the customers' mindset regarding their home is very straightforward. As long as their home is increasing in value, they see upgrades and enhancements to their home as an investment and not an expense.  \n Looking ahead, although the business environment remains uncertain, we are confident that our Total Home strategy provides us with the agility to operate with profitability in times of high and low customer mobility.  \n And finally, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our frontline associates. As I travel the country on a weekly basis visiting stores, I'm continually inspired by the hard work and commitment of our associates to support our communities while providing excellent customer service. \n And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. \n U.S. comparable sales were down 2.2% in the second quarter but up 32% on a 2-year basis. We drove solid positive comps in our building products and home decor divisions. And while we delivered a terrific spring over the first half of the year, the pivot in consumer behavior after Memorial Day resulted in negative comps in our seasonal categories this quarter. However, growth was broad-based on a 2-year basis with all product categories up more than 15% in that time frame. \n In building products, we delivered double-digit comps in electrical and lumber driven by strong Pro demand as well as high levels of inflation. And as Marvin mentioned, our merchandising and finance teams navigated through unprecedented lumber price volatility this quarter. Our enhanced pricing systems enabled us to effectively mitigate the impact on our product margins. Dave will provide more detail on the near-term impact of the lumber price decline on our margins and sales, but I'm confident that our talented teams have the right pricing tools and processes to continue to manage through elevated levels of inflation and pricing volatility.  \n I'm also pleased with our performance in home decor as DIY customers continue to rely on Lowe's for their home remodeling needs. By leveraging our Total Home strategy, we delivered positive comps across appliances, kitchens and bath, flooring and decor on top of over 20% growth in these categories last year.  \n Capitalizing on our #1 position in appliances, we delivered strong comps in the category this quarter with particularly standout performance in washers and dryers as well as refrigerators and freezers. Countertops, kitchen cabinets and vanities were the strongest contributors to our kitchen and bath comps as our customers continue to appreciate the new on-trend, coordinated styles that are available in our own allen + roth brand. \n Vinyl flooring was the top-performing category within flooring driven by new and innovative WetProtect product from Pergo. It's a leading brand in this category that is exclusive to Lowe's, and this product provides peace of mind to our customers with its guaranteed waterproof protection for both the flooring and sub-floor. \n We also delivered a strong spring season in the first half of the year that kicked off with the launch of our new SpringFest event. We were very pleased that our customers took advantage of the strong product offerings to help make the most out of their outdoor living spaces. \n In this quarter, we delivered over 30% growth in battery-operated outdoor power equipment. Both our DIY and Pro customers are drawn to the convenience and the quality of the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands with their zero-emission, rechargeable equipment. And the addition of the EGO and Skill brands only bolsters our #1 position in outdoor power equipment, and they truly complement our other leading brands such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and CRAFTSMAN. \n We continue to add new brands and products to our lineup, especially for our Pro customer. This quarter, with the launch of FLEX Power Tools, we featured an in-store demo station for our new FLEX cordless power tools. This brand is exclusive to Lowe's and delivers innovation to the power tool category, bringing more power and faster charging time than its competition.  \n We also introduced the Mansfield brand across our bath department with drop-in tubs, showers and toilets. Another exclusive in the home center space, Mansfield is a strong Pro brand and their products are made right here in the United States. \n And I'm excited to announce that we'll be bringing more U.S.-manufactured product to Lowe's this fall with the launch of SPAX fasteners. SPAX is the market leader in multi-material construction screws. Their industry-leading innovation delivers some of the most advanced fasteners on the market. The addition of SPAX to the fastener program now rounds out the Pro assortment in this category that our Pro customers need. \n The addition of Flex Power Tools, Mansfield plumbing products and SPAX fasteners, continues to enhance our Pro brand arsenal, which already includes strong Pro brands such as Simpson Strong-Tie, DEWALT, Bosch, Spyder, GRK, FastenMaster, ITW, Lufkin, Marshalltown, [ S Wing ], Eaton, SharkBite and LESCO.  \n As Marvin previously discussed, we delivered strong sales growth of 7% and a 2-year growth of 151% on Lowes.com. This quarter, we enhanced our omnichannel customer experience with the launch of our virtual kitchen design, which enables customers to create their dream kitchen, allowing them to work on their projects seamlessly between Lowes.com and the specialists on our virtual central design team. \n As part of our Total Home strategy, we are launching virtual search in our stores, which now allows a customer to hover their smartphone over a product and explore an endless aisle of similar items on Lowes.com. This is just one example of how we continue to integrate the online and in-store shopping experiences. \n And looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming fall and winter holiday seasons as our customers will turn their attention to doing their homes and outdoor living spaces as the weather cools. We are confident that our Total Home strategy will enable us to continue to elevate our product assortment and allow us to take market share across our DIY and Pro customers. \n We will also continue to leverage our new price management system to effectively manage our product margins with a disciplined approach to vendor cost management and a data-driven portfolio approach to pricing to further enhance and refine our everyday competitive price strategy. \n And before I close, I'd like to once again extend my appreciation to our vendor partners and our merchants for their commitment to serving our customers. \n Thank you and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. \n For the second quarter, we continued to drive improved execution in our stores with our associates laser-focused on serving customers and maintaining a safe store environment. In early August, in response to the surge of the Delta variant, we reinstated mask requirements for all of our associates regardless of their vaccination status. I'm appreciative that our associates are once again rising to the dynamic challenges presented by this pandemic. \n I'm pleased to announce that for the sixth consecutive quarter, 100% of our stores earned a Winning Together profit-sharing bonus, resulting in a $91 million expected payout to our frontline hourly associates. And because our efforts once again exceeded expectations, this represents an incremental $20 million over the target payment level. \n We're also very pleased that our PPI initiatives continue to gain traction, driving operating efficiency again this quarter as we leverage store payroll through operational process improvements and technology enhancements, reducing the amount of time our associates spend on tasking activities so they can focus instead on serving the customer. \n During the quarter, we maintained strong staffing levels despite isolated labor shortages in some areas of the country. We continue to enhance the labor scheduling system that we launched in 2019, which allows us to align our payroll hours with customer traffic patterns. It also enables us to respond rapidly and effectively to changing market conditions so that we can ensure that we continue to provide great customer service while also driving operating leverage. \n This year, we've installed our homegrown self-checkout solution in over 550 stores that did not have any self-checkout capability for our customers. This Lowe's-designed self-checkout was built with the home improvement shopper in mind, featuring a simplified user interface, multiple ways to scan product and the ability to use Lowe's military and credit card discounts. \n This new solution is already driving higher customer adoption rates and incremental payroll leverage. And with the digital signs fully rolled out across lumber and appliances, we are not only driving labor savings but also enhance product margins as we can now adjust prices more quickly to protect share and margins during periods of price volatility. \n As previously discussed, our online penetration for the quarter was 9%. And with approximately 60% of online orders picked up in the store, our dedicated in-store fulfillment teams are an integral part of the Lowe's omnichannel customer experience. We are continuing to leverage technology to improve efficiency in the customer experience, whether customers get their orders the front desk or through curbside or through their favorite option, our new pickup lockers. \n Now let's turn to our performance of the Pro customer. As discussed earlier, Pro continues to outpace DIY with Pro comps of 21% for the quarter and 49% on a 2-year basis. We continue to expand our digital connection with the Pro customers. We just completed the migration of Lowe's for Pros to the cloud. \n This important step in our Pro business evolution enables enhanced features, faster updates, improved site stability and more personalized offers for the Pro. One new feature is rapid reorder, which enables our Pro customers to quickly reorder items that they frequently purchase through Lowe's. \n We are focused on making the Pro shopping experience both online and in-store as easy and intuitive as possible. We're also growing our Pro loyalty program as we look for innovative ways to expand our members-only benefits. Every day, we are striving to demonstrate that Lowe's is the new home for Pros. \n Looking ahead, I'm excited about the second half of the year as we leverage our Total Home strategy to build on the momentum in Pro and Installation Services while also meeting the needs of the DIY customers as they continue to tackle interior and exterior projects to improve their homes. \n Before I close, I would like to once again extend my appreciation to our frontline associates along with other executive and senior officers as well as merchants and field leaders. I'm out visiting stores on a weekly basis to ensure that we continue to engage with and support our frontline associates in this challenging operating environment. I'm incredibly proud of this team and their continued hard work and dedication. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. \nDavid Denton: Thanks, Joe, and I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the company's strong capital allocation program. \n In the second quarter, we generated $2 billion in free cash flow driven by continued strong operational execution and consumer demand. We returned $3.6 billion to our shareholders through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we paid $430 million in dividends at $0.60 per share and we announced a 33% dividend increase to $0.80 per share for the dividend paid on August 4. Additionally, we repurchased 16.4 million shares for $3.1 billion and we have $13.6 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. \n Capital expenditures totaled $385 million in the quarter as we invest in the business to support our strategic growth initiatives. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, which remains extremely healthy. At quarter end, adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR stands at 2.08x, well below our long-term stated target of 2.75x. \n With that, now I'd like to turn to the income statement. In Q2, we generated diluted earnings per share of $4.25, an increase of 13% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year. During the quarter, we drove improved operating leverage as we executed against numerous productivity initiatives across the company. \n My comments from this point forward will include approximations and comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures where applicable. Q2 sales were $27.6 billion with a comparable sales decline of 1.6%. Comparable average ticket increased 11.3% driven by over 400 basis points of commodity inflation, mostly in lumber, as well as higher sales of appliances and installations. This was offset by comp transaction count declining 12.9% due to lower sales to DIY customers of smaller ticket items like cleaning products, paint, mulch and live goods. \n In Q2, we cycled over a period when consumer mobility was limited, so many of our customers were tackling smaller projects around their homes. Also in Q2 of this year, DIY customers pulled back on purchasing lumber and related attachments due to extremely elevated lumber prices in the quarter. Keep in mind that comp transactions increased 22.6% last year, which results in a 2-year comp transaction count increase of 6.8%. \n As Marvin indicated, our investments in our Total Home strategy gave us the ability to pivot during the quarter and led to outperformance in many of our key growth areas with Pro up 21%, online up 7%, Installation Services up 10% and strong positive comps across DIY decor categories. U.S. comp sales were down 2.2% in the quarter but up 32% on a 2-year basis. Our U.S. monthly comps were negative 6.4% in May, negative 1.8% in June and a positive 2.6% in July. \n After Memorial Day, there was a noticeable increase in consumer mobility and consumers engaged in the opportunity to travel and spend in other discretionary categories. We saw a related decline in DIY customer traffic in our stores on the weekends while weekday traffic remained strong. \n Looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2019 to '21, May sales increased 32.5%, June increased 32% and July increased 31.5%. Gross margin was 33.8%. As expected, gross margin rate declined 30 basis points from last year but was up 165 basis points as compared to Q2 of '19. Product margin rate improved 40 basis points. \n Our teams effectively managed product cost and pricing this quarter despite unprecedented volatility in lumber prices. Our teams continue to minimize vendor cost increases driven by higher commodity prices and elevated industry transportation costs. Also, higher credit revenue drove 30 basis points of benefit to gross margin this quarter. These benefits were offset by 20 basis points of pressure from shrink and live good damages from the extreme weather conditions in the West, also 25 basis points of mix pressure related to lumber and 20 basis points from less favorable product mix in other categories. \n Supply chain costs also pressured margin by 35 basis points as we absorbed some elevated distribution costs and continue to expand our omnichannel capabilities. Our supply chain team continues to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to minimize the impact of these distribution costs experienced across the retail industry. \n Now I'd like to spend just a moment discussing the near-term impact from the steep drop in lumber prices beginning in early July. Since that time, we have been selling many of our lumber products at compressed margins because we had previously purchased these products at higher cost. However, we expect that by the end of August, we will have substantially sold through these higher cost inventory layers. And despite these short-term pressures, we are still expecting that our gross margin rate to be up slightly for the full year versus last year. \n SG&A at 17% of sales levered 135 basis points versus LY driven primarily by lower COVID-related costs. We incurred $25 million of COVID-related expenses in the quarter as compared to $430 million of COVID-related expenses last year. The $405 million reduction in these expenses generated 145 basis points of SG&A leverage. These benefits were offset by 20 basis points of pressure from higher overall employee health care costs. \n Operating profit was $4.2 billion, an increase of 6% over LY. Operating margins of 15.3% of sales for the quarter was up 80 basis points to the prior year. This improvement was generated by improved SG&A leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. The effective tax rate was 24.4%, and it was in line with prior year. \n At the end of the quarter, inventory was $17.3 billion, down $1.1 billion from Q1 and in line with seasonal trends. This reflects an increase of $3.5 billion from Q2 of 2020 when our in-stock positions were pressured due to elevated demand levels and COVID-related supply disruption. Current inventory includes a year-over-year increase of $665 million related to inflation, the majority of which is attributable to lumber. \n Now before I close, let me comment on our current trends and how we are planning the business for the second half of this year. Clearly, we continue to manage our business in a very fluid environment with the Delta variant trends injecting new uncertainty into the forecast. However, given our strong first half performance, Lowe's is clearly tracking well ahead of our robust market scenario that we shared with investors back in December of 2020. \n Our outlook assumes that the home improvement market will moderate somewhat in the second half given lower levels of commodity inflation and a continued increase in consumer mobility driven by return to work and school. We are expecting Lowe's mix-adjusted market demand to be essentially flat for the full year. This relevant market view reflects Lowe's higher DIY mix and lower online penetration. \n Now in this revised scenario, we expect Lowe's to deliver sales of approximately $92 billion for the year, representing 2-year comparable sales growth of approximately 30%. Month-to-date, August U.S. comp sales trends are materially consistent with July's performance levels on a 2-year comparable basis. As expected, we are already seeing a several hundred basis point improvement in comp transaction count over the Q2 levels, partially driven by increased unit sales of DIY lumber and related attachments as DIY customers who were sitting on the sidelines reengaged after lumber prices dropped. \n Importantly, we expect gross margin rate to be up slightly versus the prior year as we leverage our pricing and promotional strategies to mitigate the impacts of product and transportation cost inflation. With elevated sales levels projected and our current productivity efforts taking hold, we are now raising our outlook for operating income margin to 12.2% for the full year. We are expecting a 10 basis point negative impact from elevated cost inflation. \n Furthermore, we are tracking well ahead of our operating plans. And as such, we now expect to incur higher-than-planned incentive compensation, resulting in 20 basis points of pressure. Together, these expenses represent 30 basis points of operating margin deleverage relative to the $92 billion revenue outlook. Without these offsets in expenses, we would be expecting an operating income margin of 12.5% for the full year. \n When I consider our outlook for the business for the remainder of this year, I'm very pleased that we are now expected to deliver approximately 145 basis points of operating margin improvement over 2020. This reflects a disciplined focus on driving productivity and operational excellence across the organization. We are planning for capital expenditures of $2 billion for the year. Furthermore, we expect to execute a minimum of $9 billion in share repurchases. \n In closing, we are operating in a great sector expected to benefit from the secular tailwinds over the next several years. We are investing in the business and our Total Home strategy to drive long-term growth so that we continue to outperform the market and drive meaningful long-term shareholder value. \n With that, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Just given the changes in the Pro with all the brand additions you've made and the changes you've made to the store plus the change we've seen in terms of sales mix towards the Pro, can we assume that the sales mix for Pro for Lowe's is higher than the 20% to 25% you've quoted in the past? And how did the Pro comp of 21% compare to your plan for the quarter? \nMarvin Ellison: Kate, this is Marvin. I'll take the question. I would say that Pro outperformed our original plan. We knew that we would see a greater shift to Pro versus DIY based on what we saw in the first quarter. But the 21% comp and the 49% 2-year comp is something that exceeded our original expectations. \n Having said that, if you take a look at our Pro penetration from 2018 to today, it's roughly a 300 basis points improvement. But as our total sales continues to grow, the overall Pro penetration still hovers around 25%. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And just with regards to gross margin as a follow-up question, it seems that your guidance for gross margin being up slightly for the year implies that gross margins can be flat to up in the back half. Is there any way to delineate what Q3 looks like versus Q4? \nDavid Denton: Kate, it's Dave. I'm probably not going to give that level of granularity. I would say what is important, you have it exactly right, we do expect gross margin in the back half to be up slightly and certainly up for the full year. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question, it's a little theoretical on actually '22, and I know you haven't given guidance on this yet. The question is, if the business grows next year, if the industry grows next year, is there any cost pressure that we're seeing from this environment that could preclude margins from growing in a sales growth environment? \n And then alternatively, if sales are flat or decline slightly, are there enough levers in the transformation of this business to allow margins to grow? And I'm just trying to understand what sort of buttons in FLEX and how you think about managing the business going into next year. \nDavid Denton: Simeon, this is Dave. Maybe I'll start. I'm sure Marvin will maybe chime in here a bit as well. Is -- clearly, as we stated today, we had an objective to get to 12%. Now just with the strength of the business, seeing line of sight to above 12% at this juncture, clearly, we have aspirations and targets to get to 13%, and we're still tracking nicely to those -- to that objective. \n As we said, we are experiencing cost pressures from an industry perspective. Our model and what we put into the business and invest in the business allows us to be flexible and pivot such that in periods when sales are flat or sales are going up slightly, we can actually lever the business. So it's our expectation that we would continue to make progress as we continue to march to that longer-term goal of 13%. \nMarvin Ellison: Simeon, this is Marvin. The only point I'll add is we're very pleased that over the last 3 years, we've been able to put systems and organizational structures in place that really supports Dave's point of the agility we have. \n If you go back to first quarter of 2019 when we had the cost and price issues, we had no internal mechanisms to manage that effectively. We've now rolled out a new modern price management system. Bill Boltz, Dave Denton and the merchants and finance team have created cost mitigation teams that work on a daily basis, helping us to manage cost retail and making the right decisions that first we'll think about the customer and how we can deliver value on an ongoing basis. \n So in summary, we now have levers that we can pull that we didn't have in the past. And so Dave's point is exactly correct, we think we can manage this effectively today and in the future. \nSimeon Gutman: And then maybe the related follow-up and thinking about the composition of the different margins, the gross margin and the SG&A, I know -- I think conceptually, the growth shouldn't really be going up much. But within the transformation, there are certain things that are targeted on the gross margin line like some of the supply chain initiatives that should lower some -- take some costs out of the business. So is the principal still the same where gross is still sort of rangebound and it's SG&A leveraged is how the margin expansion should come from here? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Simeon, that is correct. Keep in mind that we're making really nice progress from a product margin perspective. We continue to expand in that area. At the same time, we're investing in supply chain. And as we invest in supply chain, that essentially dilutes gross margin, but it relieves us of SG&A in the store. So therefore, the flow-through is very productive on the bottom line. But again, you have a geography shift as costs move up in the gross margin but out of SG&A. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. \nZachary Fadem: So within the context of your 12.2% EBIT margin outlook, could you parse out the impact from the productivity enhancements you've been making across the business, things like market-based delivery, labor scheduling, digital signage, et cetera? And as we think about the back half of the year, should we expect these benefits to widen? Or are there any offsets from incremental investment like resets, et cetera? \nJoseph McFarland: There's no incremental projects that we're putting on our plate at this point in time for the balance of the year. I think the playbook that we launched at the beginning of the year continues to hold true because we're making the right investments in our business, and we don't see a need to change that. \n Having said that, if you look at the back half of the year, we are making investments in supply chain. We're -- as Marvin indicated, we now have launched Florida. We're going to roll it out into other markets for the balance of the year. So that's putting some pressure on us as we plan, but you're going to see SG&A leverage come through as we continue to invest in productivity. It's going to drive performance, and we're going to overlap COVID-related expenses that are nonrecurring in the back half of this year, both of which is really driving SG&A productivity. \nMarvin Ellison: And Zach, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add is, Joe mentioned in his prepared comments our rollout of our proprietary developed self-checkout and how that's not only creating a better customer experience, it's also helping us to leverage payroll expense the correct way by implementing technology that reduces manual labor spend. \n And we talked about our PPI initiatives where we have a long list of technology enhancements that Joe is working with Seemantini, our Chief Information Officer, that's allowing us to improve productivity, improve the customer experience and reduce tasking hours, and all of that is part of the equation of us now tracking toward our 13% operating income long-term target. \nZachary Fadem: Got it. And then you called out some reluctance or elasticity in the first half of the year given the rise in lumber and building material prices. So with pricing now starting to come in a bit and July, August comps inflected positive, could you talk about whether you think projects were delayed at all in the first half and to what extent this could be a driver of reacceleration in the second half? \nMarvin Ellison: So I'll let Joe take that and let him just talk specifically about what we're hearing from our Pro customers about their book of business and also as we look at our Installation Services business, what we see in our own pipeline. \nJoseph McFarland: So Michael (sic) [ Zach ], a couple of things. First, starting with the services, we definitely believe in the project business of this install business. And when you look, there were definite categories delayed, things primarily outdoor projects, fencing, decking. As you looked at the peak in lumber prices, we found where customers were not willing to continue to invest based on the price. At the same time, we mentioned in the prepared remarks the strength in kitchen and bath, our interior category has really outperformed in the second quarter, delivering over 20% comp. \n So as we look at the shift from exterior to interior, we look at the focus of the total home, we look at our focus on the Pro business, we migrated to the Google Cloud, we rolled out Pro loyalty and we continue to add enhanced features and we're seeing great response from the customers from services standpoint, also the Pros from Lowe's being the new home for Pros. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Marvin, the general perception is that the DIY market is going to slow considerably and Lowe's will be disproportionately negatively impacted by that given the mix of business. How would that be wrong? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, I'm not saying that is wrong. I think that also may consider that we're not going to improve our Pro business. So as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we've been working diligently for 24 months to really have a solid Pro business. One of the reasons why we delivered a 32% 2-year comp is because 49% of our Pro comp drove that in that 2-year basis. \n So if you look at it in isolation, Michael, that probably is a true statement, but it's a dynamic business. Dynamic in the nature that we're improving our Pro business reflected by the results, dynamic in the nature that we're going to continue to take market share with the DIY customer with the things that we're launching in Decor, how we're enhancing the allen + roth brand. We just acquired STAINMASTER as a brand that we're going to expand. \n So I think that the dynamic nature of DIY and our growth in Pro I think will put that synopsis into questions. \nDavid Denton: Yes. Michael, this is Dave. Just don't forget that what has happened here over the last 18 months is a reemphasis back on the home and what you're seeing is despite the fact that the market is open -- or the U.S. market is opening up, you're still seeing a large contingent of work from home, school from home, utilizing their home for other activities other than just dwelling. \n So I believe that over time, there is a secular trend and tailwind to this industry both from a Pro and from a DIY perspective. It -- I assume demand will mitigate a little bit, but it's not going to fall off the floor either. \nMichael Lasser: Got it. Super helpful. My follow-up question is, can you quantify the comp and margin lift that you've seen in Florida? And you mentioned that you're going to roll this out to other markets through the rest of the year. How quickly can you have this up and running across the country across all of your markets? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're looking at an 18-plus month rollout cycle because we want to ensure that we do it efficiently and there is a significant amount of change management, change management from a process standpoint for our associates and change management in putting new systems in so that we can basically create virtual inventory and not have inventory on hand to sell, which is exactly what a market-based delivery model is. \n We're very pleased with what we're seeing in Florida. We're pleased with the inventory reduction, the lift in sales, the productivity, the expense reduction. But we're a big company. And we want to make sure, as the old saying goes, we go slow to go fast, so we can do this efficiently. But we're excited about the possibilities. \n And as I said, this is the foundation of our supply chain transformation. And Don Frieson, our lead in supply chain, joined the operations team, deserve a lot of credit along with IT for allowing us to have the success in Florida that we're now confident that we can roll this out to the whole company. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Can you talk -- just to check our math. So it seems like you're a 1% to 2% comp quarter to date. Is that right? And can you talk about what you're seeing on the Pro versus DIY trend as some of the schools have gone back? Maybe in the south, are you seeing more of a focus on the home and expect that sort of the DIY business can hold in as people get back in their homes? \nMarvin Ellison: Chris, as you can respect, we want to -- we don't want to get too granular on our inter-quarter data. We felt it was prudent to share August trends just based on the unique nature of our business environment. But if you go back to Dave's comments, we compare August month to date to July on a 2-year comp basis. That -- so that's how we're looking at the business. We think with the extraordinary business results we saw in 2020, the best way for us to measure our business is to look at it on a 2-year basis. \n Now having said that, we feel great about the trends that we're seeing across Pro and DIY. We believe that for the balance of the year, the Pro customer will outperform DIY just based on the year-over-year overlaps. But as Dave said, we're equally confident that the DIY will continue to invest in their home because of home price appreciation, because of the age of housing stock and because of the simple nature that as your home increases in value, you have more confidence to invest. \n So we feel great about our performance. We feel so much in strong support that we raise our outlook on the top and bottom line, and that reflects that we have a pretty good line of sight to how the rest of the year should play out. \nChristopher Horvers: Yes. Absolutely. \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. And I'll just an additional comment. Your question specifically on south and performance in the second quarter, we were very pleased with Southern division's performance from a Pro standpoint. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Yes. The 2-year CAGR sequentially was very strong. And following up on the gross margin side. So you did go slightly above the prior guidance. So is the pricing sophistication and maybe credit driving that improved outlook? And just to foot back to that 10 basis points, it sounds like lumber pressure, that would all accrue, that's an annual impact and that's basically all going to impact the third quarter. \nDavid Denton: Well, I think what we said is we're now, at the moment, experiencing margin pressure in lumber, and that's going to cycle through here by the end of August. We feel good about that. We continue to invest and focus on both our cost management and our pricing ecosystem here at Lowe's. And I think between the merchant and finance team, we have a really good analytical process that we're driving performance in those areas, and we have now really good line of sight to seeing gross margins up this year despite the fact that we are making investments in supply chain that is compressing margin from a cost perspective. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. \nSteven Zaccone: I wanted to focus on the Pro side of the business since you're having outperformance thus far in 2021. Can you talk a bit about market share performance, maybe how you feel relative to the competition thus far? \nMarvin Ellison: Steve, I would say, as I have said in previous calls that home improvement market share data is suspect at best because the data set is not great. As we look at our growth in Pro, anytime you grow the business, 49% on a 2-year basis, you can assume pretty confidently that you're taking market share. And we think that, that market share is coming from a host of competitors, both small and large. \n I think it's also reflective that Lowe's has not had a coherent Pro strategy in the past 10 years. And I think Joe McFarland and his team along with Bill Boltz and the merchants have done a really nice job of getting us a line on Pro. What I'd like to do is I just want to be able to take a moment and talk about some of the Pro brands that we've been able to add in brands that are untapped that we think will continue to allow us to take share in this business. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. So Steve, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned we're getting ready this quarter to round out our fastener program with the launch of SPAX, just a great program in the fastener segment, already complementing other brands that the merchants have brought in with the likes of GRK, FastenMaster, Power Pro One. \n And then across other parts of our business, we announced Mansfield, that's a strong Pro brand in the plumbing space. We've had success getting Honda to join the Lowe's family, which is a big deal for us; another great program, LESCO fertilizers that we talked about in the first quarter. \n And then we've had just real good success of getting other brands like Marshalltown, ITW, Lufkin. I named a bunch of them, and we're just -- we're fortunate that these brands have recognized the value of what we're doing at Lowe's with the Pro strategy and recognize that it's an opportunity for them to grow as well. \nSteven Zaccone: Great. Just a follow-up on the e-com side of the business since you're still seeing some growth there on top of the strength last year, what are the priorities to continue to drive growth there this year? And I guess longer term, where do you think penetration could fall for that side of the business? \nWilliam Boltz: So Steve, this is Bill. So on the Lowes.com side, obviously, continuing to enhance product assortments, continuing to make sure that content is enriched in all of the kind of the basic fundamentals are key to continuing to build this out. But as we said in our prepared remarks, we've had new enhancements that we've been able to leverage, the kitchen design program, virtual search. We've also, as Joe mentioned, migrated the Lowe's for Pros over to the cloud. We moved all of Lowes.com to the cloud a few months back. All of those initiatives are helping, making it easier and faster to make enhancements to the Lowes.com business on a weekly basis. And then the merchant teams are continuing to look at ways in which we test new products and test new brands and doing different things. So working with our brand advocates to make sure that we're putting the right stuff out there in front of the customer, the recommended products that go with a product so that you can buy the whole project. \n So just a lot of great things going on with the Lowes.com team. And they continue to bring enhancements on a weekly basis to make sure that we're relevant. And we see this as a nice opportunity for us over the next 3-plus years to continue to grow our business. \nMarvin Ellison: And on the penetration question, we'll probably end the year around 10%. And we are purposely not trying to set penetration targets. We're really trying to be more customer-centric and create an environment for a customer to shop any way they choose. I mean we talk about omnichannel, and that's an overused term lately. But in essence, we just want to give the customer choices to shop, in store, online, pick up in a locker, curbside, in store, ship from store, and just provide a multitude of options. And we'll let the penetration kind of land where it lands. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. \nEric Bosshard: Two things. First of all, the lumber gross margin impact on the year is likely worse than what you initially anticipated. Can you talk a bit about what's better on the other side of that? And within this, could you also address the promotional investment in 2Q and 2H and what you're doing there and how that's having an influence on gross margin as well? \nDavid Denton: Eric, this is Dave. Obviously, it was hard to predict how gross margin was going to play out specifically for lumber this year, but obviously, we are experiencing some pressure at this point in time. I would say what we've done is taking a portfolio approach across our business and making sure that we're managing gross margin holistically such that we can deliver upon the objectives and the commitments we have from an investor perspective. So there's -- the offsets to that are fairly comprehensive across the portfolio of products. \n And I'd say from a promotional standpoint, I'll ask Bill to comment on this, but we want to make sure that we're relevant on key holidays and Tier 1 events, but we're not nearly as broad and/or as deep from a promotional standpoint as we would have been back in 2019. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes, Dave. And Eric, I think I'd add, we've talked about this in the past. We've been on this march for an everyday competitive pricing strategy. And we wanted to make sure that when we got here, we wanted to unwind this high-low strategy that had been in place across a lot of categories. So when you think about pressure from lumber, how does it get offset elsewhere, it gets offset elsewhere by not having some of these categories on a heavy promotional drug. And so we know that we can compete every day on a competitive pricing basis, and that's the work that the team has been doing. \n And then you put all the efforts that we've talked about with the pricing, the cost team, the finance team collaboration with the merchants in addition to our field merchants and our field leaders out in the field, we can -- we're on this march now for opportunities local to do different things and to enhance margins that way. \n So from an event standpoint, very typical events in Q2 with Memorial Day, Father's Day, July 4 and a kind of a more normal event approach. And as we look at the back half of the year, similar trends as we look at the second half. So nothing crazy. \nEric Bosshard: Great. And then just one follow-up. The sales guidance for the second half implies some degree of moderation from 2Q or July, August, and there's lots of ways to look at the numbers. Encouraged by the operating margin move up, but the sales guide still seems a little bit conservative. How would you characterize the sales guidance? And is there something else we should be thinking within what that considers? \nDavid Denton: Eric, this is Dave. I don't think you should read into that too much. I think at the end of the day, we're just operating in a very fluid environment. We just want to make sure that we have line of sight to what we're going to deliver for the full year. \n Yes, typically, sales do moderate in the back half of the year. I think we've just taken a realistic appropriate approach to thinking about how our back half is going to play out, and this is how we're planning it. \nMarvin Ellison: Eric, this is Marvin. The point I'll add to that is, you can appreciate that this is a really unique environment and a very difficult environment to forecast. And you have quite a few retailers who's not even given any guidance at all or outlook on the second half of the year because of that. We wanted to be as transparent as possible, but we also wanted to be slightly conservative. Because there's so much fluid activity happening in this environment, we felt that it was prudent to be conservative, but also, we felt it was equally prudent to be as transparent as possible on how we're seeing the business. But to Dave's point, don't read too much into that. \nOperator: Our next questions are from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. \nGregory Melich: I'd like to start just to make sure I got the inflation number right. The 400 bps, was that just lumber or was that inflation that we could compare to the average ticket growth of 10%? \nDavid Denton: It was everything, but it was primarily focused on lumber, though. It's predominantly lumber. \nGregory Melich: Got it. So it's probably lumber commodities, but it's not like there's another 200 bps there that would have been rest of box inflation. \nDavid Denton: That's correct. \nGregory Melich: Got it. And then the follow-up was really -- Marvin, you spoke in the prepared comments and there were several questions along the way on the marketplace rollout for big and bulky. Could you help describe what that means in practical terms to both the DIY and the Pro business? Some of that -- what it does to OpEx and CapEx for the next 18-plus months as you're rolling it out? \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. We talked early on in the supply chain transformation that we're going to be making a $1.7 billion investment over a 4-year span. This whole market delivery transformation is included in that overall supply chain transformation. So we're not increasing any capital spend to achieve this or to roll this out over the next 18-plus months. But really what this means, it just gives us the ability to create a more efficient, modern delivery process. \n So as an example, in the markets today where we don't have market delivery, when you come in to buy an appliance, the associate is going to sell you an appliance based on the in-stock that they have in their store or in a storage container. If it's not physically within their eyesight, they will not sell that appliance. And let's say you do sell it, then you will literally have to call the customer via telephone to arrange a delivery scheduled time. So imagine in 2021 that you don't have the ability to go online and create a virtual schedule for delivery. So all of that is being shifted and transformed to a more modern delivery model. So we keep the inventory centrally, so we got inventory reduction, we have less damage. Joe and team are using less SG&A in the stores to move things around, load things up, drive trucks. And more importantly, it gives us the ability to hold inventory centrally to create, in some cases, same-day, next-day delivery options for customers in a model that we just can't replicate without having this fully rolled out. \n So we're very excited about it. This is just one of the many steps in our supply chain transformation, but this is a foundational step. And again, we're going to get this done. We just want to be prudent and not get over our skis and overburden the company from a change management standpoint, but we couldn't be more excited about what we're seeing in Florida. \nJoseph McFarland: And listen, Greg, to Marvin's point, this is a really innovative approach to kind of how we're going to market from a supply chain perspective. But as we roll this out, to your point, we do experience some compression because as we ramp these up the first few months, we're not at full capacity. And so we experienced some margin headwinds as we get up to speed. But that is all contemplated in our 12.2% guide and our objective to get to 13% as well. So this is consistent with that narrative over the long term. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. \n I'd like to begin by taking a moment to extend my thoughts and prayers to those who are impacted by the ongoing pandemic as well as the many wildfires. At Lowe's, we remain committed to the health and safety of our associates and customers while supporting the communities in which we operate. The resilience of our customers and our associates is something that I admire on a daily basis.  \n Now turning to our results. We are very pleased with the performance for the second quarter. During the quarter, comparable sales declined 1.6% for the total company and 2.2% for the U.S. And on a 2-year basis, comp sales were positive 32% for the total company and for the U.S. Our outstanding 2-year performance was driven by great execution of our Total Home strategy, which allowed us to win with both the Pro and DIY customers while meeting the aggressive growth demands across Pro, Lowes.com and our Installation Services business. \n As anticipated, during the quarter, we saw a decline in DIY demand versus last year as many families transition back to pre-COVID purchase patterns and weekend mobility after Memorial Day. But because of the agility of our Total Home strategy, we were able to capitalize on Pro demand driving growth of 21% this quarter and 49% on a 2-year basis. \n This level of Pro growth would not have been possible without our intense focus on the Pro customer over the past 24 months. This intense Pro focus includes our U.S. stores reset project that we executed last year. This reset has allowed us to create a more intuitive store layout for the Pro aligned across product adjacencies, so Pros can quickly and easily locate all products they need for their jobs. \n And as a reminder, our core Pro customer is a small- to medium-sized business owner. These customers shop frequently across the store, impacting numerous product categories.  And as we continue to capture more of their spend, we will continue to increase productivity across the top and bottom line of our stores. Later in the call, Bill will discuss how we will continue to expand our Pro product offerings and then Joe will discuss our enhanced online experience for the Pro.  \n We also delivered double-digit growth this quarter in our Installation Services. We continue to expand the products available for installation, and we're leveraging our enhanced e-commerce platform and our revamped business model to deliver a better customer experience. We expect our Installation Services business to continue to play an important role in our Total Home strategy as customers increasingly look to us to provide an end-to-end turnkey solution for their home project needs.  \n And at Lowes.com, sales grew 7% on top of 135% growth in the second quarter of 2020, which represents a 9% sales penetration this quarter and a 2-year comp of 151%. Our enhanced omnichannel offering continues to resonate with our customers who increasingly expect total flexibility in shopping however, whenever and wherever they choose.  \n We're also pleased with the performance of our Canadian business. In the second quarter, Canada delivered comp growth in line with the U.S. despite several COVID-related operating restrictions. We also continued to elevate our product offering, which is another pillar of our Total Home strategy as we help fulfill the aspirations of our customers to upgrade their homes and style.  And we delivered strong positive comps across kitchen and bath, flooring, appliances and decor on top of 20% growth in these categories last year. The 17% growth we experienced in ticket over $500 was in large part driven by these categories, reflecting continued consumer confidence in investing in their homes. This also reinforces the consumers' confidence in Lowe's as the right destination for their home decor needs.  \n And during the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 80 basis points leading to diluted earnings per share of $4.25, which is a 13% increase as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in the prior year. In the face of unprecedented lumber price volatility during the second quarter, our improved operating performance reflects the benefits of our new price management system along with our disciplined focus on perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI. Bill and Joe will discuss both these initiatives in more detail later in the call.  \n I'd now like to take a moment to discuss a very important milestone in the company's transformation. When I joined Lowe's as CEO back in July of 2018, I discussed the importance of transforming and modernizing our supply chain. The foundation of this transformation is transitioning the company from a store-based delivery model to a market-based delivery model for big and bulky products. \n I'm pleased to announce that this quarter, we completed the conversion of our Florida region to a market-based delivery model for appliances and other big and bulky items like grills, riding lawn mowers and select patio furniture. In this new delivery model, product flows from the bulk distribution centers to cross-dock terminals directly to customers' homes, bypassing the stores altogether. This replaces a legacy store delivery model where we hold appliances in stockrooms and storage containers behind our stores and then leverage store-based trucks and associates to deliver these products to customers' homes. \n To say this legacy process is inefficient would be an extreme understatement. The new market-based delivery model is already driving higher appliance sales, improved profitability, lower inventory, higher on-time delivery rates and improved customer satisfaction. And we're freeing up space in our stockrooms, which will enable us to expand our same-day and next-day Pro and DIY fulfillment capabilities in the near future.  \n We plan to roll out the market-based delivery model across additional regions by the end of the year and then complete the rollout across the U.S. over the next 18-plus months. With this new delivery model, we will continue to drive sales, inventory turns and operating leverage through a technology-driven, simplify and customer-centric process.  \n Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market as well as Lowe's opportunity to win in this market. The outlook for the home improvement industry remains very positive. Residential investment is expected to remain high due to historically low mortgage rates while home prices continue to appreciate.  We're also pleased that we continue to see higher household formation trends and longer-term wallet share shift to the home. \n It's also worth noting that any near-term pressures on housing turnover is not related to an economic downturn as typical. In fact, there is more housing demand than supply, resulting in home prices continuing to rise. And because of this, consumers have an increased confidence in repairing and remodeling their homes.  As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of Lowe's annual sales are generated from repair and maintenance activity. \n Further, our research shows that it will take years for the supply of homes to meet the projected demand. This remains a very positive indicator for home improvement. In addition, the customers' mindset regarding their home is very straightforward. As long as their home is increasing in value, they see upgrades and enhancements to their home as an investment and not an expense.  \n Looking ahead, although the business environment remains uncertain, we are confident that our Total Home strategy provides us with the agility to operate with profitability in times of high and low customer mobility.  \n And finally, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our frontline associates. As I travel the country on a weekly basis visiting stores, I'm continually inspired by the hard work and commitment of our associates to support our communities while providing excellent customer service. \n And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. Kate, this is Marvin. I'll take the question. I would say that Pro outperformed our original plan. We knew that we would see a greater shift to Pro versus DIY based on what we saw in the first quarter. But the 21% comp and the 49% 2-year comp is something that exceeded our original expectations. \n Having said that, if you take a look at our Pro penetration from 2018 to today, it's roughly a 300 basis points improvement. But as our total sales continues to grow, the overall Pro penetration still hovers around 25%. Simeon, this is Marvin. The only point I'll add is we're very pleased that over the last 3 years, we've been able to put systems and organizational structures in place that really supports Dave's point of the agility we have. \n If you go back to first quarter of 2019 when we had the cost and price issues, we had no internal mechanisms to manage that effectively. We've now rolled out a new modern price management system. Bill Boltz, Dave Denton and the merchants and finance team have created cost mitigation teams that work on a daily basis, helping us to manage cost retail and making the right decisions that first we'll think about the customer and how we can deliver value on an ongoing basis. \n So in summary, we now have levers that we can pull that we didn't have in the past. And so Dave's point is exactly correct, we think we can manage this effectively today and in the future. And Zach, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add is, Joe mentioned in his prepared comments our rollout of our proprietary developed self-checkout and how that's not only creating a better customer experience, it's also helping us to leverage payroll expense the correct way by implementing technology that reduces manual labor spend. \n And we talked about our PPI initiatives where we have a long list of technology enhancements that Joe is working with Seemantini, our Chief Information Officer, that's allowing us to improve productivity, improve the customer experience and reduce tasking hours, and all of that is part of the equation of us now tracking toward our 13% operating income long-term target. So I'll let Joe take that and let him just talk specifically about what we're hearing from our Pro customers about their book of business and also as we look at our Installation Services business, what we see in our own pipeline. Well, I'm not saying that is wrong. I think that also may consider that we're not going to improve our Pro business. So as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we've been working diligently for 24 months to really have a solid Pro business. One of the reasons why we delivered a 32% 2-year comp is because 49% of our Pro comp drove that in that 2-year basis. \n So if you look at it in isolation, Michael, that probably is a true statement, but it's a dynamic business. Dynamic in the nature that we're improving our Pro business reflected by the results, dynamic in the nature that we're going to continue to take market share with the DIY customer with the things that we're launching in Decor, how we're enhancing the allen + roth brand. We just acquired STAINMASTER as a brand that we're going to expand. \n So I think that the dynamic nature of DIY and our growth in Pro I think will put that synopsis into questions. Well, I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're looking at an 18-plus month rollout cycle because we want to ensure that we do it efficiently and there is a significant amount of change management, change management from a process standpoint for our associates and change management in putting new systems in so that we can basically create virtual inventory and not have inventory on hand to sell, which is exactly what a market-based delivery model is. \n We're very pleased with what we're seeing in Florida. We're pleased with the inventory reduction, the lift in sales, the productivity, the expense reduction. But we're a big company. And we want to make sure, as the old saying goes, we go slow to go fast, so we can do this efficiently. But we're excited about the possibilities. \n And as I said, this is the foundation of our supply chain transformation. And Don Frieson, our lead in supply chain, joined the operations team, deserve a lot of credit along with IT for allowing us to have the success in Florida that we're now confident that we can roll this out to the whole company. Chris, as you can respect, we want to -- we don't want to get too granular on our inter-quarter data. We felt it was prudent to share August trends just based on the unique nature of our business environment. But if you go back to Dave's comments, we compare August month to date to July on a 2-year comp basis. That -- so that's how we're looking at the business. We think with the extraordinary business results we saw in 2020, the best way for us to measure our business is to look at it on a 2-year basis. \n Now having said that, we feel great about the trends that we're seeing across Pro and DIY. We believe that for the balance of the year, the Pro customer will outperform DIY just based on the year-over-year overlaps. But as Dave said, we're equally confident that the DIY will continue to invest in their home because of home price appreciation, because of the age of housing stock and because of the simple nature that as your home increases in value, you have more confidence to invest. \n So we feel great about our performance. We feel so much in strong support that we raise our outlook on the top and bottom line, and that reflects that we have a pretty good line of sight to how the rest of the year should play out. Yes. And I'll just an additional comment. Your question specifically on south and performance in the second quarter, we were very pleased with Southern division's performance from a Pro standpoint. Steve, I would say, as I have said in previous calls that home improvement market share data is suspect at best because the data set is not great. As we look at our growth in Pro, anytime you grow the business, 49% on a 2-year basis, you can assume pretty confidently that you're taking market share. And we think that, that market share is coming from a host of competitors, both small and large. \n I think it's also reflective that Lowe's has not had a coherent Pro strategy in the past 10 years. And I think Joe McFarland and his team along with Bill Boltz and the merchants have done a really nice job of getting us a line on Pro. What I'd like to do is I just want to be able to take a moment and talk about some of the Pro brands that we've been able to add in brands that are untapped that we think will continue to allow us to take share in this business. And on the penetration question, we'll probably end the year around 10%. And we are purposely not trying to set penetration targets. We're really trying to be more customer-centric and create an environment for a customer to shop any way they choose. I mean we talk about omnichannel, and that's an overused term lately. But in essence, we just want to give the customer choices to shop, in store, online, pick up in a locker, curbside, in store, ship from store, and just provide a multitude of options. And we'll let the penetration kind of land where it lands. Eric, this is Marvin. The point I'll add to that is, you can appreciate that this is a really unique environment and a very difficult environment to forecast. And you have quite a few retailers who's not even given any guidance at all or outlook on the second half of the year because of that. We wanted to be as transparent as possible, but we also wanted to be slightly conservative. Because there's so much fluid activity happening in this environment, we felt that it was prudent to be conservative, but also, we felt it was equally prudent to be as transparent as possible on how we're seeing the business. But to Dave's point, don't read too much into that. Yes. We talked early on in the supply chain transformation that we're going to be making a $1.7 billion investment over a 4-year span. This whole market delivery transformation is included in that overall supply chain transformation. So we're not increasing any capital spend to achieve this or to roll this out over the next 18-plus months. But really what this means, it just gives us the ability to create a more efficient, modern delivery process. \n So as an example, in the markets today where we don't have market delivery, when you come in to buy an appliance, the associate is going to sell you an appliance based on the in-stock that they have in their store or in a storage container. If it's not physically within their eyesight, they will not sell that appliance. And let's say you do sell it, then you will literally have to call the customer via telephone to arrange a delivery scheduled time. So imagine in 2021 that you don't have the ability to go online and create a virtual schedule for delivery. So all of that is being shifted and transformed to a more modern delivery model. So we keep the inventory centrally, so we got inventory reduction, we have less damage. Joe and team are using less SG&A in the stores to move things around, load things up, drive trucks. And more importantly, it gives us the ability to hold inventory centrally to create, in some cases, same-day, next-day delivery options for customers in a model that we just can't replicate without having this fully rolled out. \n So we're very excited about it. This is just one of the many steps in our supply chain transformation, but this is a foundational step. And again, we're going to get this done. We just want to be prudent and not get over our skis and overburden the company from a change management standpoint, but we couldn't be more excited about what we're seeing in Florida."

            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe, and I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the company's strong capital allocation program. \n In the second quarter, we generated $2 billion in free cash flow driven by continued strong operational execution and consumer demand. We returned $3.6 billion to our shareholders through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we paid $430 million in dividends at $0.60 per share and we announced a 33% dividend increase to $0.80 per share for the dividend paid on August 4. Additionally, we repurchased 16.4 million shares for $3.1 billion and we have $13.6 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. \n Capital expenditures totaled $385 million in the quarter as we invest in the business to support our strategic growth initiatives. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, which remains extremely healthy. At quarter end, adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR stands at 2.08x, well below our long-term stated target of 2.75x. \n With that, now I'd like to turn to the income statement. In Q2, we generated diluted earnings per share of $4.25, an increase of 13% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year. During the quarter, we drove improved operating leverage as we executed against numerous productivity initiatives across the company. \n My comments from this point forward will include approximations and comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures where applicable. Q2 sales were $27.6 billion with a comparable sales decline of 1.6%. Comparable average ticket increased 11.3% driven by over 400 basis points of commodity inflation, mostly in lumber, as well as higher sales of appliances and installations. This was offset by comp transaction count declining 12.9% due to lower sales to DIY customers of smaller ticket items like cleaning products, paint, mulch and live goods. \n In Q2, we cycled over a period when consumer mobility was limited, so many of our customers were tackling smaller projects around their homes. Also in Q2 of this year, DIY customers pulled back on purchasing lumber and related attachments due to extremely elevated lumber prices in the quarter. Keep in mind that comp transactions increased 22.6% last year, which results in a 2-year comp transaction count increase of 6.8%. \n As Marvin indicated, our investments in our Total Home strategy gave us the ability to pivot during the quarter and led to outperformance in many of our key growth areas with Pro up 21%, online up 7%, Installation Services up 10% and strong positive comps across DIY decor categories. U.S. comp sales were down 2.2% in the quarter but up 32% on a 2-year basis. Our U.S. monthly comps were negative 6.4% in May, negative 1.8% in June and a positive 2.6% in July. \n After Memorial Day, there was a noticeable increase in consumer mobility and consumers engaged in the opportunity to travel and spend in other discretionary categories. We saw a related decline in DIY customer traffic in our stores on the weekends while weekday traffic remained strong. \n Looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2019 to '21, May sales increased 32.5%, June increased 32% and July increased 31.5%. Gross margin was 33.8%. As expected, gross margin rate declined 30 basis points from last year but was up 165 basis points as compared to Q2 of '19. Product margin rate improved 40 basis points. \n Our teams effectively managed product cost and pricing this quarter despite unprecedented volatility in lumber prices. Our teams continue to minimize vendor cost increases driven by higher commodity prices and elevated industry transportation costs. Also, higher credit revenue drove 30 basis points of benefit to gross margin this quarter. These benefits were offset by 20 basis points of pressure from shrink and live good damages from the extreme weather conditions in the West, also 25 basis points of mix pressure related to lumber and 20 basis points from less favorable product mix in other categories. \n Supply chain costs also pressured margin by 35 basis points as we absorbed some elevated distribution costs and continue to expand our omnichannel capabilities. Our supply chain team continues to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to minimize the impact of these distribution costs experienced across the retail industry. \n Now I'd like to spend just a moment discussing the near-term impact from the steep drop in lumber prices beginning in early July. Since that time, we have been selling many of our lumber products at compressed margins because we had previously purchased these products at higher cost. However, we expect that by the end of August, we will have substantially sold through these higher cost inventory layers. And despite these short-term pressures, we are still expecting that our gross margin rate to be up slightly for the full year versus last year. \n SG&A at 17% of sales levered 135 basis points versus LY driven primarily by lower COVID-related costs. We incurred $25 million of COVID-related expenses in the quarter as compared to $430 million of COVID-related expenses last year. The $405 million reduction in these expenses generated 145 basis points of SG&A leverage. These benefits were offset by 20 basis points of pressure from higher overall employee health care costs. \n Operating profit was $4.2 billion, an increase of 6% over LY. Operating margins of 15.3% of sales for the quarter was up 80 basis points to the prior year. This improvement was generated by improved SG&A leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. The effective tax rate was 24.4%, and it was in line with prior year. \n At the end of the quarter, inventory was $17.3 billion, down $1.1 billion from Q1 and in line with seasonal trends. This reflects an increase of $3.5 billion from Q2 of 2020 when our in-stock positions were pressured due to elevated demand levels and COVID-related supply disruption. Current inventory includes a year-over-year increase of $665 million related to inflation, the majority of which is attributable to lumber. \n Now before I close, let me comment on our current trends and how we are planning the business for the second half of this year. Clearly, we continue to manage our business in a very fluid environment with the Delta variant trends injecting new uncertainty into the forecast. However, given our strong first half performance, Lowe's is clearly tracking well ahead of our robust market scenario that we shared with investors back in December of 2020. \n Our outlook assumes that the home improvement market will moderate somewhat in the second half given lower levels of commodity inflation and a continued increase in consumer mobility driven by return to work and school. We are expecting Lowe's mix-adjusted market demand to be essentially flat for the full year. This relevant market view reflects Lowe's higher DIY mix and lower online penetration. \n Now in this revised scenario, we expect Lowe's to deliver sales of approximately $92 billion for the year, representing 2-year comparable sales growth of approximately 30%. Month-to-date, August U.S. comp sales trends are materially consistent with July's performance levels on a 2-year comparable basis. As expected, we are already seeing a several hundred basis point improvement in comp transaction count over the Q2 levels, partially driven by increased unit sales of DIY lumber and related attachments as DIY customers who were sitting on the sidelines reengaged after lumber prices dropped. \n Importantly, we expect gross margin rate to be up slightly versus the prior year as we leverage our pricing and promotional strategies to mitigate the impacts of product and transportation cost inflation. With elevated sales levels projected and our current productivity efforts taking hold, we are now raising our outlook for operating income margin to 12.2% for the full year. We are expecting a 10 basis point negative impact from elevated cost inflation. \n Furthermore, we are tracking well ahead of our operating plans. And as such, we now expect to incur higher-than-planned incentive compensation, resulting in 20 basis points of pressure. Together, these expenses represent 30 basis points of operating margin deleverage relative to the $92 billion revenue outlook. Without these offsets in expenses, we would be expecting an operating income margin of 12.5% for the full year. \n When I consider our outlook for the business for the remainder of this year, I'm very pleased that we are now expected to deliver approximately 145 basis points of operating margin improvement over 2020. This reflects a disciplined focus on driving productivity and operational excellence across the organization. We are planning for capital expenditures of $2 billion for the year. Furthermore, we expect to execute a minimum of $9 billion in share repurchases. \n In closing, we are operating in a great sector expected to benefit from the secular tailwinds over the next several years. We are investing in the business and our Total Home strategy to drive long-term growth so that we continue to outperform the market and drive meaningful long-term shareholder value. \n With that, we are now ready for questions. Kate, it's Dave. I'm probably not going to give that level of granularity. I would say what is important, you have it exactly right, we do expect gross margin in the back half to be up slightly and certainly up for the full year. Simeon, this is Dave. Maybe I'll start. I'm sure Marvin will maybe chime in here a bit as well. Is -- clearly, as we stated today, we had an objective to get to 12%. Now just with the strength of the business, seeing line of sight to above 12% at this juncture, clearly, we have aspirations and targets to get to 13%, and we're still tracking nicely to those -- to that objective. \n As we said, we are experiencing cost pressures from an industry perspective. Our model and what we put into the business and invest in the business allows us to be flexible and pivot such that in periods when sales are flat or sales are going up slightly, we can actually lever the business. So it's our expectation that we would continue to make progress as we continue to march to that longer-term goal of 13%. Yes. Simeon, that is correct. Keep in mind that we're making really nice progress from a product margin perspective. We continue to expand in that area. At the same time, we're investing in supply chain. And as we invest in supply chain, that essentially dilutes gross margin, but it relieves us of SG&A in the store. So therefore, the flow-through is very productive on the bottom line. But again, you have a geography shift as costs move up in the gross margin but out of SG&A. Yes. Michael, this is Dave. Just don't forget that what has happened here over the last 18 months is a reemphasis back on the home and what you're seeing is despite the fact that the market is open -- or the U.S. market is opening up, you're still seeing a large contingent of work from home, school from home, utilizing their home for other activities other than just dwelling. \n So I believe that over time, there is a secular trend and tailwind to this industry both from a Pro and from a DIY perspective. It -- I assume demand will mitigate a little bit, but it's not going to fall off the floor either. Well, I think what we said is we're now, at the moment, experiencing margin pressure in lumber, and that's going to cycle through here by the end of August. We feel good about that. We continue to invest and focus on both our cost management and our pricing ecosystem here at Lowe's. And I think between the merchant and finance team, we have a really good analytical process that we're driving performance in those areas, and we have now really good line of sight to seeing gross margins up this year despite the fact that we are making investments in supply chain that is compressing margin from a cost perspective. Eric, this is Dave. Obviously, it was hard to predict how gross margin was going to play out specifically for lumber this year, but obviously, we are experiencing some pressure at this point in time. I would say what we've done is taking a portfolio approach across our business and making sure that we're managing gross margin holistically such that we can deliver upon the objectives and the commitments we have from an investor perspective. So there's -- the offsets to that are fairly comprehensive across the portfolio of products. \n And I'd say from a promotional standpoint, I'll ask Bill to comment on this, but we want to make sure that we're relevant on key holidays and Tier 1 events, but we're not nearly as broad and/or as deep from a promotional standpoint as we would have been back in 2019. Eric, this is Dave. I don't think you should read into that too much. I think at the end of the day, we're just operating in a very fluid environment. We just want to make sure that we have line of sight to what we're going to deliver for the full year. \n Yes, typically, sales do moderate in the back half of the year. I think we've just taken a realistic appropriate approach to thinking about how our back half is going to play out, and this is how we're planning it. It was everything, but it was primarily focused on lumber, though. It's predominantly lumber. That's correct."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. \n U.S. comparable sales were down 2.2% in the second quarter but up 32% on a 2-year basis. We drove solid positive comps in our building products and home decor divisions. And while we delivered a terrific spring over the first half of the year, the pivot in consumer behavior after Memorial Day resulted in negative comps in our seasonal categories this quarter. However, growth was broad-based on a 2-year basis with all product categories up more than 15% in that time frame. \n In building products, we delivered double-digit comps in electrical and lumber driven by strong Pro demand as well as high levels of inflation. And as Marvin mentioned, our merchandising and finance teams navigated through unprecedented lumber price volatility this quarter. Our enhanced pricing systems enabled us to effectively mitigate the impact on our product margins. Dave will provide more detail on the near-term impact of the lumber price decline on our margins and sales, but I'm confident that our talented teams have the right pricing tools and processes to continue to manage through elevated levels of inflation and pricing volatility.  \n I'm also pleased with our performance in home decor as DIY customers continue to rely on Lowe's for their home remodeling needs. By leveraging our Total Home strategy, we delivered positive comps across appliances, kitchens and bath, flooring and decor on top of over 20% growth in these categories last year.  \n Capitalizing on our #1 position in appliances, we delivered strong comps in the category this quarter with particularly standout performance in washers and dryers as well as refrigerators and freezers. Countertops, kitchen cabinets and vanities were the strongest contributors to our kitchen and bath comps as our customers continue to appreciate the new on-trend, coordinated styles that are available in our own allen + roth brand. \n Vinyl flooring was the top-performing category within flooring driven by new and innovative WetProtect product from Pergo. It's a leading brand in this category that is exclusive to Lowe's, and this product provides peace of mind to our customers with its guaranteed waterproof protection for both the flooring and sub-floor. \n We also delivered a strong spring season in the first half of the year that kicked off with the launch of our new SpringFest event. We were very pleased that our customers took advantage of the strong product offerings to help make the most out of their outdoor living spaces. \n In this quarter, we delivered over 30% growth in battery-operated outdoor power equipment. Both our DIY and Pro customers are drawn to the convenience and the quality of the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands with their zero-emission, rechargeable equipment. And the addition of the EGO and Skill brands only bolsters our #1 position in outdoor power equipment, and they truly complement our other leading brands such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and CRAFTSMAN. \n We continue to add new brands and products to our lineup, especially for our Pro customer. This quarter, with the launch of FLEX Power Tools, we featured an in-store demo station for our new FLEX cordless power tools. This brand is exclusive to Lowe's and delivers innovation to the power tool category, bringing more power and faster charging time than its competition.  \n We also introduced the Mansfield brand across our bath department with drop-in tubs, showers and toilets. Another exclusive in the home center space, Mansfield is a strong Pro brand and their products are made right here in the United States. \n And I'm excited to announce that we'll be bringing more U.S.-manufactured product to Lowe's this fall with the launch of SPAX fasteners. SPAX is the market leader in multi-material construction screws. Their industry-leading innovation delivers some of the most advanced fasteners on the market. The addition of SPAX to the fastener program now rounds out the Pro assortment in this category that our Pro customers need. \n The addition of Flex Power Tools, Mansfield plumbing products and SPAX fasteners, continues to enhance our Pro brand arsenal, which already includes strong Pro brands such as Simpson Strong-Tie, DEWALT, Bosch, Spyder, GRK, FastenMaster, ITW, Lufkin, Marshalltown, [ S Wing ], Eaton, SharkBite and LESCO.  \n As Marvin previously discussed, we delivered strong sales growth of 7% and a 2-year growth of 151% on Lowes.com. This quarter, we enhanced our omnichannel customer experience with the launch of our virtual kitchen design, which enables customers to create their dream kitchen, allowing them to work on their projects seamlessly between Lowes.com and the specialists on our virtual central design team. \n As part of our Total Home strategy, we are launching virtual search in our stores, which now allows a customer to hover their smartphone over a product and explore an endless aisle of similar items on Lowes.com. This is just one example of how we continue to integrate the online and in-store shopping experiences. \n And looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming fall and winter holiday seasons as our customers will turn their attention to doing their homes and outdoor living spaces as the weather cools. We are confident that our Total Home strategy will enable us to continue to elevate our product assortment and allow us to take market share across our DIY and Pro customers. \n We will also continue to leverage our new price management system to effectively manage our product margins with a disciplined approach to vendor cost management and a data-driven portfolio approach to pricing to further enhance and refine our everyday competitive price strategy. \n And before I close, I'd like to once again extend my appreciation to our vendor partners and our merchants for their commitment to serving our customers. \n Thank you and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. So Steve, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned we're getting ready this quarter to round out our fastener program with the launch of SPAX, just a great program in the fastener segment, already complementing other brands that the merchants have brought in with the likes of GRK, FastenMaster, Power Pro One. \n And then across other parts of our business, we announced Mansfield, that's a strong Pro brand in the plumbing space. We've had success getting Honda to join the Lowe's family, which is a big deal for us; another great program, LESCO fertilizers that we talked about in the first quarter. \n And then we've had just real good success of getting other brands like Marshalltown, ITW, Lufkin. I named a bunch of them, and we're just -- we're fortunate that these brands have recognized the value of what we're doing at Lowe's with the Pro strategy and recognize that it's an opportunity for them to grow as well. So Steve, this is Bill. So on the Lowes.com side, obviously, continuing to enhance product assortments, continuing to make sure that content is enriched in all of the kind of the basic fundamentals are key to continuing to build this out. But as we said in our prepared remarks, we've had new enhancements that we've been able to leverage, the kitchen design program, virtual search. We've also, as Joe mentioned, migrated the Lowe's for Pros over to the cloud. We moved all of Lowes.com to the cloud a few months back. All of those initiatives are helping, making it easier and faster to make enhancements to the Lowes.com business on a weekly basis. And then the merchant teams are continuing to look at ways in which we test new products and test new brands and doing different things. So working with our brand advocates to make sure that we're putting the right stuff out there in front of the customer, the recommended products that go with a product so that you can buy the whole project. \n So just a lot of great things going on with the Lowes.com team. And they continue to bring enhancements on a weekly basis to make sure that we're relevant. And we see this as a nice opportunity for us over the next 3-plus years to continue to grow our business. Yes, Dave. And Eric, I think I'd add, we've talked about this in the past. We've been on this march for an everyday competitive pricing strategy. And we wanted to make sure that when we got here, we wanted to unwind this high-low strategy that had been in place across a lot of categories. So when you think about pressure from lumber, how does it get offset elsewhere, it gets offset elsewhere by not having some of these categories on a heavy promotional drug. And so we know that we can compete every day on a competitive pricing basis, and that's the work that the team has been doing. \n And then you put all the efforts that we've talked about with the pricing, the cost team, the finance team collaboration with the merchants in addition to our field merchants and our field leaders out in the field, we can -- we're on this march now for opportunities local to do different things and to enhance margins that way. \n So from an event standpoint, very typical events in Q2 with Memorial Day, Father's Day, July 4 and a kind of a more normal event approach. And as we look at the back half of the year, similar trends as we look at the second half. So nothing crazy."

            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. \n For the second quarter, we continued to drive improved execution in our stores with our associates laser-focused on serving customers and maintaining a safe store environment. In early August, in response to the surge of the Delta variant, we reinstated mask requirements for all of our associates regardless of their vaccination status. I'm appreciative that our associates are once again rising to the dynamic challenges presented by this pandemic. \n I'm pleased to announce that for the sixth consecutive quarter, 100% of our stores earned a Winning Together profit-sharing bonus, resulting in a $91 million expected payout to our frontline hourly associates. And because our efforts once again exceeded expectations, this represents an incremental $20 million over the target payment level. \n We're also very pleased that our PPI initiatives continue to gain traction, driving operating efficiency again this quarter as we leverage store payroll through operational process improvements and technology enhancements, reducing the amount of time our associates spend on tasking activities so they can focus instead on serving the customer. \n During the quarter, we maintained strong staffing levels despite isolated labor shortages in some areas of the country. We continue to enhance the labor scheduling system that we launched in 2019, which allows us to align our payroll hours with customer traffic patterns. It also enables us to respond rapidly and effectively to changing market conditions so that we can ensure that we continue to provide great customer service while also driving operating leverage. \n This year, we've installed our homegrown self-checkout solution in over 550 stores that did not have any self-checkout capability for our customers. This Lowe's-designed self-checkout was built with the home improvement shopper in mind, featuring a simplified user interface, multiple ways to scan product and the ability to use Lowe's military and credit card discounts. \n This new solution is already driving higher customer adoption rates and incremental payroll leverage. And with the digital signs fully rolled out across lumber and appliances, we are not only driving labor savings but also enhance product margins as we can now adjust prices more quickly to protect share and margins during periods of price volatility. \n As previously discussed, our online penetration for the quarter was 9%. And with approximately 60% of online orders picked up in the store, our dedicated in-store fulfillment teams are an integral part of the Lowe's omnichannel customer experience. We are continuing to leverage technology to improve efficiency in the customer experience, whether customers get their orders the front desk or through curbside or through their favorite option, our new pickup lockers. \n Now let's turn to our performance of the Pro customer. As discussed earlier, Pro continues to outpace DIY with Pro comps of 21% for the quarter and 49% on a 2-year basis. We continue to expand our digital connection with the Pro customers. We just completed the migration of Lowe's for Pros to the cloud. \n This important step in our Pro business evolution enables enhanced features, faster updates, improved site stability and more personalized offers for the Pro. One new feature is rapid reorder, which enables our Pro customers to quickly reorder items that they frequently purchase through Lowe's. \n We are focused on making the Pro shopping experience both online and in-store as easy and intuitive as possible. We're also growing our Pro loyalty program as we look for innovative ways to expand our members-only benefits. Every day, we are striving to demonstrate that Lowe's is the new home for Pros. \n Looking ahead, I'm excited about the second half of the year as we leverage our Total Home strategy to build on the momentum in Pro and Installation Services while also meeting the needs of the DIY customers as they continue to tackle interior and exterior projects to improve their homes. \n Before I close, I would like to once again extend my appreciation to our frontline associates along with other executive and senior officers as well as merchants and field leaders. I'm out visiting stores on a weekly basis to ensure that we continue to engage with and support our frontline associates in this challenging operating environment. I'm incredibly proud of this team and their continued hard work and dedication. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. There's no incremental projects that we're putting on our plate at this point in time for the balance of the year. I think the playbook that we launched at the beginning of the year continues to hold true because we're making the right investments in our business, and we don't see a need to change that. \n Having said that, if you look at the back half of the year, we are making investments in supply chain. We're -- as Marvin indicated, we now have launched Florida. We're going to roll it out into other markets for the balance of the year. So that's putting some pressure on us as we plan, but you're going to see SG&A leverage come through as we continue to invest in productivity. It's going to drive performance, and we're going to overlap COVID-related expenses that are nonrecurring in the back half of this year, both of which is really driving SG&A productivity. So Michael (sic) [ Zach ], a couple of things. First, starting with the services, we definitely believe in the project business of this install business. And when you look, there were definite categories delayed, things primarily outdoor projects, fencing, decking. As you looked at the peak in lumber prices, we found where customers were not willing to continue to invest based on the price. At the same time, we mentioned in the prepared remarks the strength in kitchen and bath, our interior category has really outperformed in the second quarter, delivering over 20% comp. \n So as we look at the shift from exterior to interior, we look at the focus of the total home, we look at our focus on the Pro business, we migrated to the Google Cloud, we rolled out Pro loyalty and we continue to add enhanced features and we're seeing great response from the customers from services standpoint, also the Pros from Lowe's being the new home for Pros. And listen, Greg, to Marvin's point, this is a really innovative approach to kind of how we're going to market from a supply chain perspective. But as we roll this out, to your point, we do experience some compression because as we ramp these up the first few months, we're not at full capacity. And so we experienced some margin headwinds as we get up to speed. But that is all contemplated in our 12.2% guide and our objective to get to 13% as well. So this is consistent with that narrative over the long term."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe's Companies First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Dave Denton, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's investor relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2021. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.  \n Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in this morning's press release in our investor relations website. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the company. We would also like to extend our thoughts and prayers to our associates in India, who are grappling with an aggressive resurgence of COVID in the country. At Lowe's, we have associates in Bangalore, India in our digital, information technology and finance functions who played a key role in our transformation efforts over the past 2 years. To help our team in India safeguard their health, we sent personal protective equipment to our team members there. We've also made financial commitments to support nonprofit organizations in India that are working to respond to this humanitarian crisis.  \n As we have moved into the second year of the pandemic, we remain focused on our #1 priority, which has always been protecting the health and safety of our associates and communities. And with that in mind, in Q1, we invested nearly $60 million in support of COVID safety protocols.  \n Now turning to our results. Our outstanding performance continued this quarter with total company comparable sales growth of 25.9%. Our U.S. comps were 24.4% with broad-based growth across all geographic regions and divisions. In fact, for the quarter, comp sales for all 15 U.S. regions exceeded 18% and all U.S. divisions exceeded 20%. During the quarter, operating margin expanded 313 basis points on an adjusted basis, leading to diluted earnings per share of $3.21, which is an 81% increase on an adjusted basis over the prior year.  \n Our outperformance in operating margin was supported by our continued transition to an everyday competitive price strategy as well as our disciplined pricing and product cost management strategies. Our improved operating margin also reflects the progress of our operational transformation driven by our perpetual productivity initiatives or PPI. Bill will discuss our everyday competitive price strategy, pricing and product cost management, and Joe will provide details on our PPI initiatives later in the call.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 36.5% on top of 80% growth in the first quarter of 2020, which represents a 9% sales penetration this quarter and a 2-year comp of 146%. With customer demand for an integrated omnichannel shopping experience only increasing, we continue to invest in our omnichannel capabilities. Pro comps outpaced DIY comps with over 30% comps in the quarter. Although this has been a 2-year journey, I'm very pleased with the progress that we made with our Pro customer. We began by addressing the basics, ensuring that we were carrying the brands and products that Pros need in the job lot quantities, and also provided the excellent service this busy customer expects.  \n And now we've shifted to the more strategic phase of growth in the Pro by resetting the layout of our stores with the Pro in mind and deepening our relationship with the Pro through a loyalty program that provides them with members-only benefits. Joe will discuss more about the specific initiatives that we're undertaking to serve the Pro, both online and in-store later in the call.  \n The small- and medium-sized Pro is our target customer. This customer is a frequent shopper who purchases products in multiple departments, which drives increased productivity throughout the store. And I'm confident that we have a compelling growth opportunity as we continue to improve our engagement with this highly valued customer. In addition to the strength in Pro, we delivered over 60% comps along with significant increase in customer satisfaction in our installation services business. \n We've overhauled this business and improved the service offering by consolidating our provider network and implementing industry-leading technology. And although all of us are looking forward to a post-COVID world, our research tells us that the importance of the home will remain elevated for many years to come. And given the increased importance of the home, this quarter, we launched SpringFest, our new reimagined approach to the season. \n Our campaign provided inspiration for home projects so our customers could transport themselves to the destination of their choice without ever leaving the sanctuary of home. In a moment, Bill will discuss the outstanding results that we were able to generate from this reimagination of spring.  \n Now turning to Canada. We delivered comp growth that outpaced the U.S. despite several COVID-related operating restrictions. I'd like to thank the new Canadian leadership team for all of their hard work as well as the frontline associates in Canada for their resilience and commitment to continuing to serve our customers in this challenging operating environment.  \n This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of STAINMASTER brand, which is the most recognized and trusted carpet brand on the market today. With this acquisition, we're building on our decade-long exclusive position as the only national home improvement retailer to carry STAINMASTER carpet. This is an important step in our Total Home strategy as we seek to elevate our product assortment and provide consumers with the products and brands they trust for every project across the entire home. We see great potential to extend the STAINMASTER brand in other product areas where we can continue to leverage its high performance characteristics.  \n This acquisition also expands our private brand portfolio joining the family of private brands, including allen + roth, Kobalt and Project Source. We're focused on expanding our private brand penetration with a balanced brand strategy that includes a powerful national brand portfolio that appeals to both Pro and DIY customers. At the same time, we'll offer a select number of high-value private brands, building consumer loyalty for these products.  \n Our results in the first quarter continue to give me confidence that we're making the right investments to accelerate our market share gains through our Total Home strategy by enhancing our investments in Pro, online, installation services, localization and elevating our product assortment. These initiatives will allow us to drive sustainable growth as we deliver a total home solution for our Pro and our DIY customers.  \n Before I close, I'd like to, once again, extend my appreciation to our frontline associates. In the first quarter, I had an opportunity to visit stores in 9 of our 15 geographic regions. As I observed our associates hard at work serving customers through very challenging circumstances, my respect and admiration continues to grow. In recognition of these efforts, we decided to close our stores and distribution centers on Easter Sunday for the second year in a row to give our associates a much deserved day off to spend with their families and loved ones. \n I'm also pleased to announce that for the fifth consecutive quarter, 100% of our stores earned a Winning Together profit-sharing bonus, a record $152 million payout to our frontline hourly associates. This represents an incremental $70 million above the target level. While the near-term macro outlook remains uncertain, we're confident that we will continue to outperform the market driving both market share gains and improved operating efficiency.  \n Our 2-year plus journey to transform Lowe's has given us improved operating capabilities and a technology infrastructure that's dramatically enhanced, which in turn makes us more agile and able to respond quickly to any potential changes in the business environment. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. We delivered U.S. comparable sales growth of 24.4% in the first quarter. Our compelling offerings, great values and improved in-stocks allowed us to capitalize on the continued strong demand for home improvement products. Consistent with recent trends, growth was broad-based across Pro and DIY customers, in store and online and across product categories. In fact, 13 of 15 merchandising departments generated comps over 15% and all merchandising departments were up more than 20% on a 2-year comp basis.  \n As Marvin described, we were extremely pleased with how consumers responded to our SpringFest event. Similar to our approach to the winter holidays, we extended this event across 4 weeks to create a new sense of excitement and to prompt return trips, while also avoiding congestion in our stores. We offered 4 different weekly giveaways of garden-to-go kits that provided everything needed for a fun spring project, and also strengthen our customer connection through a required MyLowe's activation online. The success of this event was due to the great organizational alignment across our stores, marketing and merchant teams.  \n Turning now to our top-performing categories. Lumber again delivered the highest comp driven by strong Pro demand and unprecedented inflation in the category. Over the past year, as lumber products have been in tight supply, our merchants have worked closely with our suppliers and successfully secured new sources and additional product to ensure that we can maintain a competitive in-stock position in the category.  \n Strong in-stocks in this tight market have allowed us to continue to strengthen customer relationships, especially with the Pro. In addition to lumber, we delivered comps exceeding 30% in electrical, decor, kitchens and bath and seasonal and outdoor living. Our electrical category posted strong comps in the quarter driven by inflation in copper as well as solid demand from the robust repair/remodel market.  \n In support of our total home market share acceleration strategy, we drove strong engagement with our customers as reflected by increased sales in decor and kitchens and bath. The strong sales in our decor category were driven by great performance in home accents as we continue to elevate our product assortments, especially with our recently refreshed allen + roth brand. In fact, this quarter, our merchant teams launched new spring collections that span across the broad array of product categories through a lifestyle point of view with inspirational on-trend designs that gives our customers the confidence they need to decorate their homes in style.  \n Our kitchens and bath department outperformed in the quarter as homeowners continue to enhance their living spaces and economic stimulus supported bigger ticket projects. Finally, seasonal and outdoor living benefited from the early demand in patio and grills as homeowners embrace the arrival of spring.  \n We also saw strong sales in the newly launched battery-powered EGO and SKIL brands as consumers are attracted to the convenience and the quality of their zero-emission rechargeable outdoor power equipment. In fact, during the quarter, EGO delivered some of their largest weekly sales results in the history of their brand. The addition of EGO and SKIL has only strengthened our #1 position in outdoor power equipment and truly complements the leading brands we carry such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Ariens, and CRAFTSMAN. \n And during the quarter, we continued to see strong demand for our other powerhouse brands like Weber and Char-Broil, which remain the top 2 brands in outdoor grilling. We were excited to add new brands to our arsenal, including the exclusive launch of FLEX cordless power tools. The FLEX brand is known by the most discerning builders, contractors and trade professionals, and this new lineup of power tools offers the latest innovation, more power and faster charging than the competition.  \n We are also excited to bring the LESCO brand of fertilizer to Lowe's this spring, a brand that is trusted by landscape pros and knowledgeable homeowners alike. The addition of FLEX power tools and LESCO fertilizer further complements our powerful Pro brand lineup which already includes Simpson Strong-Tie, DEWALT, Spyder, Bosch, Eaton and SharkBite.  \n As Marvin mentioned, we delivered strong sales growth of 36.5% and a 2-year growth of 146% on Lowes.com. We continue to enhance the online customer experience with improved search and navigation functionality that allows consumers to easily shop for products across categories. Additionally, we continue to see strong download rates of our mobile app as we are working to enhance our customer loyalty through a great mobile experience.  \n As Marvin mentioned, we delivered a solid improvement in our product margins this quarter driven by disciplined vendor cost management, improved and enhanced pricing systems and our continued transition to a more relevant everyday competitive price strategy that is complemented by targeted seasonally relevant promotions. All of these initiatives are part of our ongoing merchandising excellence strategy. We will continue to leverage and refine these capabilities as we deliver strong everyday values to our consumers, while we continue to manage our product margins by taking a data-driven portfolio approach to pricing.  \n Our Total Home strategy will continue to allow us to expand and elevate our product and brand assortments and take market share. \n Before I close, I want to thank our vendor partners and our merchants for their continued focus on taking care of our stores and our customers. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our associates were laser-focused on providing excellent customer service, supporting a safe store environment and delivering record sales volumes. As Marvin mentioned, 100% of our stores earned Winning Together profit-sharing bonus, a record $152 million payout to our frontline hourly associates. I would like to thank our associates for their continued dedication in providing world-class customer service. \n As Marvin mentioned, our focus on perpetual productivity improvement or our PPI initiative continued to yield results during this quarter as we leverage store payroll by using technology to reduce tasking hours, improve customer service and increase sales productivity. For example, we rolled out digital signs first in appliances, and most recently, in our lumber department. These signs cut down on associate tasking labor and they also support better product margin performance as we can now more rapidly implement price changes in line with the market.  \n We are also leveraging an improved freight flow app, creating a fully digital process that gives our associates better line of sight to when products will arrive at our stores. The app which was developed in-house, even help store associates to prioritize the incoming merchandise so they can quickly and efficiently position the product on the sales floor for our customers.  \n And we launched secure mobile checkout, which we are using to improve speed of service in high-traffic areas inside the store and on the exterior of the store in areas such as outside lawn and garden and under the Pro canopy. This checkout app developed in-house is allowing us to take care of customers from scanning items, tendering payment and printing or e-mailing receipts before they even join the line. Our customers are delighted with the solution, especially on busy weekends.  \n We are also driving productivity in our in-store fulfillment. This quarter, we expanded our contactless shopping options by completing the rollout of BOPIS lockers to 100% of our U.S. stores in April. Customers really enjoy these touchless easy-to-use lockers. In fact, this has already become the highest-rated store fulfillment options. Having BOPIS lockers in 100% of our U.S. stores will allow us to expand our omnichannel capabilities, further improve customer satisfaction and limit customer congestion at our service desk.  \n Turning to our Pros. As Marvin mentioned, Pro outpaced DIY in the quarter with over 30% comps. We continue to gain momentum with the Pro through our improved in-stock inventory levels, our enhanced service offerings and our new Pro loyalty program. Our Pro sales associates have also begun to leverage our new CRM platform to proactively engage with our Pro customers and sell the entire project to them. Our most compelling growth opportunity with the Pro is expanding the share of wallet with our existing customers.  \n Our new CRM platform as well as the redesigned store layout that aligns product adjacencies enable us to more effectively serve their needs for the entire project across all of their jobs. And we continue to enhance the shopping experience for our Pro customers, small- to medium-sized businesses who are always pressed for time. We are launching a tailored shopping experience created specifically for Pros to ensure that the time they spend away from their job site is efficient and productive.  \n We're introducing new convenience products at checkout and services like dedicated Pro trailer parking and phone charging stations, all designed to help add value to each trip the Pros take, thus cutting down on the number of stops they make throughout the day. We're also enhancing their online experiences with the ongoing migration of Lowe's for Pros to the cloud. This will give our Pro customers access to incremental options that our DIY customers already have on Lowes.com, and it will allow us to more quickly add new Pro-only features in the future, including a personalized app experience.  \n Both in-store and online, we continue to demonstrate that Lowe's is on a mission to be the new home for Pros. As Marvin mentioned, we are seeing terrific momentum in our installation business with over 60% comps this quarter. As a reminder, just 2 years ago, this was a money-losing business with poor customer satisfaction. Although we are lapping Q1 2020 results that were pressured by COVID, we are very pleased with the overall execution and trajectory of this business.  \n In closing, I cannot be more pleased with the improvements we are making in our stores as reflected in our strong Net Promoter Scores and a recent third-party study. Our executive officer, senior officers, merchants and field leaders are out visiting stores on a weekly basis to ensure that we are listening to and supporting our frontline associates. This remains a very difficult environment to operate retail stores in and I could not be prouder of the accomplishments of this team and their commitment and hard work from our frontline associates. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. \nDavid Denton: Thank you, Joe. I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the company's robust capital allocation program. In Q1, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow driven by improved operational execution and continued strong consumer demand. We returned $3.5 billion to our shareholders through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  \n During the quarter, we paid $440 million in dividends at $0.60 per share. We also repurchased 16.8 million shares for $3.1 billion at an average price of approximately $182 a share. We have approximately $17 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Capital expenditures totaled $461 million in the quarter as we invest in our strategic initiatives to drive the business and to support our growth. We ended the quarter with $6.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, which includes proceeds from our $2 billion notes offering in March. In addition, we entered into a $1 billion term loan facility in April, which remains undrawn.  \n Our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with adjusted debt to EBITDAR at 2.07x at the end of the quarter, well below our long-term target of 2.75x.  \n Now turning to the income statement. In Q1, we generated diluted earnings per share of $3.21, an increase of 81% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year. This growth was due to strong sales growth, improved gross margin rate and SG&A leverage as a result of a strong execution across many facets of our business.  \n Please note that in the prior year quarter, there was a very modest impact on diluted earnings per share related to the Canadian restructuring effort. My comments from this point forward will include approximations when appropriate and comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures where applicable. \n Strong sales growth was driven by several factors, including: a continued consumer focused on the home; a favorable weather backdrop across the country; commodity inflation, especially within the lumber category; consumer support from the March government stimulus package; and our improved execution as we continue to elevate our product and service offerings. Q1 sales were $24.4 billion driven by a comparable sales increase of 25.9%. This was a result of a balanced contribution for both ticket and transactions as comparable average store ticket grew 14.1% and transaction count grew 11.8%, with strong repeat rates from both new and existing customers.  \n While a little difficult to measure, we estimate that the March government stimulus checks drove 300 basis points of growth, while commodity inflation benefited comps by 460 basis points in the quarter. Lumber and other commodity prices remained at elevated levels versus last year. U.S. comp sales were up 24.4% in the quarter, consistent with the results from the past few quarters. Growth was well balanced across DIY and Pro customers, selling channels, geographies and nearly all merchandise departments.  \n Our U.S. comps were 24% in February, 35.9% in March and 13.9% in April. February comps were negatively impacted by the harsh winter storms that hit Texas and several other states, while March were positively impacted by storm recovery and the third round of stimulus. Additionally, we began cycling last year's COVID-related spikes in demand in the second half of April and those more difficult comparisons impacted April comps.  \n Looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2019 to '21, February sales increased 30.3%, March increased 48.1% and April increased 37.1%. Gross margin was 33.29%, up 19 basis points from last year and up 183 basis points as compared to Q1 of '19. Product margin rate improved 165 basis points. As Bill mentioned, our teams effectively leveraged our merchandising excellence strategy to manage product cost and retail pricing throughout the quarter.  \n While we are seeing inflation in some product categories, our merchants work to diligently mitigate and minimize vendor cost increases. Additionally, our supply chain team leveraged our scale and carrier relationships to minimize distribution cost pressures experienced throughout the retail sector.  \n On the pricing side, our shift to an everyday competitive price strategy continue to benefit our margins in Q1 as we leverage enhanced pricing tools to improve margin across the array of products that we sell. We began to see improving trends from our increased focus on shrink control this quarter, with shrink improving sequentially from Q4 of 2020. However, results pressured gross margin by 15 basis points versus last year. We expect that our shrink performance will continue to improve as we move throughout the year.  \n These benefits to product margin rate were partially offset by: 90 basis points of pressure from product mix shifts due to lumber inflation and a less favorable product mix; 20 basis points of pressure from supply chain cost as we continue to invest in our omnichannel capabilities; and 20 basis points of pressure from credit revenue.  \n SG&A of 18.4% levered 288 basis points compared to adjusted SG&A in LY driven primarily by lower COVID-related costs as well as operating cost leverage resulting from strong sales and our ongoing productivity from our PPI initiative. As anticipated, we incurred nearly $60 million of COVID-related expenses as compared to approximately $320 million of COVID-related expenses last year. The $260 million reduction in these expenses generated 140 basis points of SG&A leverage. \n Additionally, strong sales and a focus on efficiency and productivity allowed us to generate leverage of 100 basis points in operating salaries, 35 basis points in occupancy expense and 5 basis points in advertising. \n Now operating profit was $3.2 billion, an increase of 63% over LY. Operating margins of 13.3% of sales for the quarter was up 317 basis points to the prior year driven by both improved operating leverage and improved gross margin rate. The effective tax rate was 23.5%. The tax rate was slightly lower than expected primarily due to a tax benefit related to the divesting of certain employee stock options. We continue to build up our inventory levels throughout the quarter to meet the sustained high levels of customer demand while improving our in-stock position.  \n At quarter end, inventory was $18.4 billion, up $2.2 billion from Q4 levels, in line with seasonal patterns. This reflects an increase of $4.1 billion from Q1 of 2020 when inventory levels were pressured due to unexpected spikes in demand as well as COVID-related supply disruptions. Of note, this includes a year-over-year increase of $780 million related specifically to inflation. \n Now before I close, let me comment on our current trends and how we are planning our business for the balance of 2021. Our year-to-date results are tracking ahead of the robust market scenario that we covered in our December investor update. The underlying drivers of home improvement demand appear to be more resilient and stable than we originally forecasted. Those factors build our confidence in our ability to deliver strong results on top of an exceptional year in 2020, including 12% operating margins and flat gross margin rates for the year. We remain confident that our Total Home strategy will enable us to capture market share. \n We are very encouraged by our performance in Q1, including our strong sales volume even as we began to cycle last year's mid-April surge in demand. Month to date, May U.S. comp sales trends are materially consistent with April performance levels on a 2-year comparable basis. Looking forward, year-over-year comparisons remain difficult throughout the remainder of the year. Also, we continue to see COVID restrictions in some areas across Canada. As markets reopen, we are closely monitoring consumer behavior, anticipating a potential modest shift in spending away from the home. We remain agile and ready to respond to whatever environment we face this year with our focus on gaining market share throughout 2021, while improving operating margins. \n With regards to our quarterly performance, please note that we are cycling particularly high gross margin levels in Q2 of LY. In the prior quarter, there was an industry-wide pullback in promotions and a more favorable product mix. As a result, we currently anticipate a moderate decline in gross margin rates in Q2. Despite this moderate year-over-year decline, our gross margin rate is expected to expand nicely over pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Investments in pricing, vendor cost management and our everyday competitive promotional strategy have been driving improvements in our gross margin performance over the past 2 years.  \n As I stated earlier, we continue to expect to deliver flat gross margin rates for 2021. Further, we expect the business to generate robust levels of free cash flow. We plan to invest $2 billion in CapEx this year to drive future growth and returns as we continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation with $9 billion in planned share repurchases this year while also supporting our dividend. In closing, we are very excited about the momentum in our business and our ability to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term. \n With that, we are now ready for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is, can you provide an update on where Pro penetration can move to over time and maybe some level of growth that you expect going forward? And I'm asking because I think part of the margin story is getting higher sales per foot, and I think Pro seems to be a big opportunity there. So curious, I don't know, Marvin or Dave, if you can just update us on that area. \nMarvin Ellison: Simeon, this is Marvin. We purposely have not set a target for Pro penetration. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we really started focusing on the basics. And now we're elevating to a more strategic phase in Pro. We also stated a while back that we estimate our Pro penetration today as between 20% and 25%. Now having said that, based on my history in this business, in the space, in Joe's history and experience in this space, we can see over time our Pro penetration getting between 30% and 35%. And we think that's the trajectory that we're currently on, but we have purposely not set a target because I've learned in the past when you set a target then you can oftentimes hit the target, but you do it at the expense of running a good business, and we're just really focused on serving the customer right now. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Fair enough. Can I ask you a macro question to whoever? And I wanted to ask, there is this school of thought that this industry, this home improvement industry, is a mid-single-digit grower, right, that did 4 or 5x that over the last 4 quarters. And so that school of thought says, hey, this industry needs to digest this growth. We may not grow going forward maybe in '22 or it may be flattish at best. And the other side is that people have spent more on their homes, there's more invested capital, so there's more maintenance repair and that we could sort of comp it. And then maybe there's a housing cycle on top of this. Curious where you shake out and what's your best guess or what some of the debates you're having on this topic are. \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. Simeon, it's a good question. I'll take the first part. I'll let Dave provide any financial perspective. But I mean we're very excited and we're very bullish on the home improvement industry in general. If you look at the macro factors that really impact this business and have historically impacted this business as things like low mortgage rates, rising home prices, the age of housing stock, improved household formation trends and also strong consumer balance sheets, I mean all of those specific macro factors are pointed in the right direction for us. In addition to that, when there's home price appreciation, that actually benefits home improvement. It may not benefit the overall housing market, but when consumers decide to stay in their existing home and make investments in upgrading the home, that correlates to really strong home improvement sales. \n And as the housing stock continues to age, we're in a repair and maintenance business, that's a significant part of what we do. So when we look at home improvement, we see really robust year-over-year growth potential relative to the macro. And then if we look at just the things that we control. I mean we've been very transparent that there have been many strategic mistakes made in this business over the past 5-plus years. And so we have what we believe is enormous upside in revenue and operating income by continuing to invest in really smart, strategic initiatives that we think will drive the business forward. And we think Q1 reflects our ability to do that with our gross margin and operating and comp performance. I'll let Dave add any additional comments if he has them. \nDavid Denton: Yes. Simeon, the only other thing that I would add is that obviously, over the next several years, we anticipated that the millennial customer would begin to migrate into the home ownership position. I think what has happened through COVID is that macro trend has probably accelerated. So probably given the industry segment a bit more tailwinds as we think about the next several years. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. \nElizabeth Lane: So if sales are running above the robust market scenario, do you think the sales upside could be reinvested into additional initiatives and to gaining market share and deepening the competitive moat? Or should we think about there potentially being upside to the 12% operating margin that was discussed in that robust demand scenario? \nDavid Denton: Liz, this is Dave. I'll start with that question there. I think what you're looking at here is we have a very specific investment thesis really as we launched it in 2020 and into '21. And I think if you look at the thesis that we have and all the priorities that we have, I think we feel like we're very well positioned making the right investments to grow our business long term, improve our operating performance. \n I do think we're also very focused on the fact that we can't really predict the macro in the back half of this year, but we are very committed to doing 2 things: one is we're going to grow market share this year; and two, we're going to improve our operating margin performance. And we do expect that to be -- if the market holds up with a robust or above robust, around 12% operating margin, and that's our focus for this year. \nElizabeth Lane: Great. And just one quick follow-up which is, which [ are ] the 2 categories comped below 15%? And what was the 2-year growth there? \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Liz, this is Bill. So all categories achieved the plus-20% draw on a 2-year basis, but the 2 categories below the company were paint and our hardware business, driven largely because of everybody painting last year during the pandemic. And then the hardware business driven by safety and masks and some of that business that spiked last year in the quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Okay. A couple -- and hate to be short-term focused here, but the -- first of all, April did fall off versus March on a 2-year basis a little bit. Do you think that's because of the stimulus that occurred in March? And then playing that forward, if we take that 2-year trend into May and for the rest of the quarter, you should be about flat in the second quarter. Is that a fair way to think about the expectations for the quarter? \nDavid Denton: Yes. I'll -- First, as you look at, I guess, our performance by month through the quarter, if you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, yes, March was somewhat inflated if you think about tech, the recovery from the storm in Texas and other states as well as stimulus hitting that period. So I think we feel very good about kind of how we ended the quarter and the trends as we cycle into May from a sales perspective. And I think, listen, we're not giving guidance for the quarter. We continue to be focused specifically on making sure that we have great service. We have -- that we're in stock in the right categories, and we're supporting our consumers across our marketplace. And I feel like we're gaining momentum as we think about our business, both in 2020 and here as we cycle into '21. \nMarvin Ellison: And Michael, this is Marvin. The only point I'll add to that is we were up against a 20.4% comp in the month of April in the U.S., and we comped almost 14% on top of that. So we feel really good about that. That exceeded our expectations, we think exceeded our internal plans. And it also demonstrates to us that even going up against some of the spike demand from last year, we still can perform at a high level. So we actually felt great about our performance in April. But it demonstrates when you're up against significant surge in demand, you're going to see sales comp pressure, and that's to be expected. \nMichael Baker: Yes. Sure. Okay, that makes sense. And to follow up and not to ask a tough question, particularly on a 25% comp against a 12% actually, really, really incredible and strong. But you talked about market share gains -- a simple look at the growth of the market using the NAICS sales in building material, garden equipment and supply stores, that did grow a little bit faster than you did this quarter. So I wonder how you think about what market are you looking at? Or what number you're looking out to underpin your market share, gain comments for the quarter and the year? \nMarvin Ellison: Michael, coming from someone who has worked in a couple of different retail formats, I've always said that home improvement has probably the most suspect market share data on a short-term basis of any retail segment. So to be quite candid, when we look at the amount of growth we delivered in the sales revenue that we generated and we look at it on a 1-year or 2-year comp basis, we can't [ quabble ] about losing market share. \n We're really focused on the broader market. And we've said consistently that in this COVID environment, and this is going to be current and post-COVID, the retailers that are: most capitalized and can make investments in omnichannel and omnichannel fulfillment; and creating different channels with customers to shop; and can lean into technology; and can also leverage the supply base as our merchants and supply chain were able to do over the past quarter will win and will take broader market share. And we believe that we did that. And so we feel very, very comfortable with our market share position and performance and with our prospects for the rest of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So a couple of questions. My first question is on the product margin benefits that you're seeing on the pricing side. Should these accelerate over the year, given that some of this -- the learning builds somewhat -- sort to, say, in the systems? And to what extent is it more sensitive to sort of highly seasonal and markdown-prone quarters, like a 2Q and a 4Q versus the third quarter? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Listen, I think -- this is Dave. We've had -- we've made a lot of investments from a product cost management and pricing perspective infrastructure here at Lowe's and feel very confident between the merchant and finance team on kind of managing that. It is not necessarily seasonally related. This is really about managing our everyday price and cost in a more effective manner overtime. I do think that we're still in the early stages of this journey as we think about the next several years to improve our performance here. Clearly, at the moment, we're -- as we said in our prepared remarks, there are some inflation pressures in our business that we're managing through. I do believe that we have -- we're continuing to invest in these tools and technologies to enable us to improve our margin performance over the longer term. \n Now keep in mind, Chris, I just want to go back to what we said of our long-term financial algorithm here is really to maintain kind of flattish gross margins over time with the fact that we would improve the product margin, but we'll reinvest some of that product margin in the supply chain to drive performance and growth over the long term. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Understood. And then in terms of -- as a follow-up on the 12% margin question, if you do end up beating that minus 2% sales outlook, I guess, why wouldn't you be above a 12%? Is there an offset, perhaps bonus and employee incentives? Is it a headwind from lumber inflation that creates a rate headwind that more than offsets the natural leverage of beating the robust scenario sales guide? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Chris, I just want to get ourselves focused. Listen, first and foremost, we've said about the fact that we've got to gain some market share. We've got to improve operating margin performance here, and we're trying to get to our 12% in the short term here. Beyond 12%, we have objectives and we believe we can expand it further, but let's at least get to our 12% margin first. And so we're just kind of laser-focused on making sure that we're delivering upon our commitments from that perspective. \nMarvin Ellison: And Chris, this is Marvin. You can appreciate the challenge we have, looking at the overall macro outlook for the business with all the dynamics occurring in the marketplace. The good news is, is the better the macro performs, the better we'll perform. We feel great about the things that we control and some of the tools and some of the processes we put in place and some of the decisions of the leadership team are really paying dividends. And as David said a couple of times already today, we're committed to outperforming the broader market and improving operating margin. And if the macro improves significantly above the robust scenario then our business will perform equally as well. And that's how we're approaching it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: You guys spoke about the big increase in lumber pricing. Depot said the same thing yesterday. Curious what you're seeing on the demand side and unit velocity over the past few months. \nMarvin Ellison: I will -- I'll start it off. What I can tell you is we're just really pleased that the merchants were able to create such strong supply relationships that we could keep up with demand in an unprecedented environment of unit demand. So I'll let Bill talk about units and how we're performing and kind of how we feel about the rest of the year. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Chuck, I think, to echo Marvin, I think demand continues to remain strong and all the preparation that was done coming off of last year has certainly enabled us to fulfill that demand going forward. All the work that's being done right now is to maintain that as we go through the rest of the year and continue to manage the needs of the Pro customer, make sure that we can take care of them first. I mean that's really what we're focused on in that job lot quantity and making sure that we're right by market, and that's been the focus of the team. \nCharles Grom: That's great to hear. So just a follow-up would be just on the installation business, you talked about a 6% comp in the quarter. I guess I'm curious like what penetration of the business is that today? How big can you grow that? And then also just from a profitability perspective, how it compares to the rest of the business? \nDavid Denton: Yes. Chuck, that business is in the mid-single digits penetration for our business. And we do think we have a big runway here. As Joe indicated in his prepared remarks, is that business was something that really wasn't invested in historically and was something that we had a really, I'd say, poor service model historically and was not the best from an operating performance perspective financially. I think we've now turned that business around and have a really nice foundation as we think about growing it. So I'll ask Joe to give a couple of comments on it. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Dave. I'll just make a few comments. You heard in my prepared remarks the performance, very, very pleased that we've attracted industry veterans that really understand the complexities of being inside the home, and especially in the COVID environment, in all the platforms that we have been focused on, the consolidation of installers across the country, and remaining laser-focused on the programs that we really want to drive, and that's all under the same umbrella as our Total Home strategy. So we're very pleased with the team's efforts. I'm very pleased with all of our installer partners across the country and looking forward to a great continued momentum here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. \nScott Mushkin: So I had a little long-term strategic question when you guys think about your business into 2022. As you look at your strategic priorities, what do you think drives incremental growth for Lowe's, kind of company specific? What are your top 3 type of things as you look out over the next 18 months? \nMarvin Ellison: Scott, this is Marvin. I think it goes directly to our total home market acceleration strategy where we talk about continuing to invest in online, which is really more omnichannel focused, making sure that we're investing in our installation services business and also improving our overall performance with the Pro. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, I mean all of our customer segments are really important, and we are focused more intently on being a customer-focused business. The Pro adds a different dimension because of the frequency of how the Pros shop and also how the Pro shops throughout the entire store. And one of the strategic mistakes made in the past here is not understanding that customer and understanding the economic value of that customer. \n So we're going to continue to stay really focused on that customer. But I would say those 3 things, omnichannel, ensuring that we can continue to have a really robust and seamless installation service business and focusing on the Pro are 3 of our priorities. But the whole Total Home strategy encompasses what we're going to be leaning into for the next couple of years. \nScott Mushkin: That's great. And then just like looking out at the back half of this year, are you guys seeing any signs that this very high level of inflation is crimping demand at all? Or is that not something you're seeing? \nMarvin Ellison: We're not seeing it. I'll give you thoughts. I'll let Dave give a more financial perspective. I mean we feel really good about this business and this business model. As I look at home improvement as an overall retail sector, I just think that even though we're all just totally fatigued, both mentally, physically with the pandemic, and there's nothing that we can say positive about operating through with all the health and safety issues that we've all dealt with both business and personal, when you look at the macro for home improvement, it's a very positive backdrop. And as we look at forward-looking quarters and into next year, even with the inflation we're seeing in certain areas, specifically lumber and copper, we just don't believe that that's going to create an impediment for growth or significant headwinds for this business sector. \n I'll let Dave add any other comments. \nDavid Denton: Yes. The only thing I would add is -- just to reconfirm what Marvin said, we see no slowdown in demand at this point in time across our business and our categories. And I think if you speak to our Pro customers, we're hearing from them that they, one, are very busy at the moment, and two, have extremely long backlogs at this point in time. So I think this demand will continue for some period of time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer & Co. \nBrian Nagel: Congrats on a nice quarter. The first question I wanted to ask, you've talked a lot about the various scenarios for 2021 and the operating margin and market share opportunities for Lowe's. How do you look at expense levers? I think you may have talked about this a bit in your prepared comments, but how do we think about the expense levers to the extent that sales proved choppier through the balance of 2021? \nDavid Denton: Yes. So obviously -- this is Dave. Obviously, the biggest expense lever we have is how we manage operating salaries across our business and probably labor a little bit in the supply chain. I think what we've done is we've -- we have invested in tools, in processes to really allow us to effectively manage that labor component and really adjust it based on demand that we're seeing from a profile perspective. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Brian, thanks for the question. And I will point out the 3 major points of the PPI initiative that we talk about. First is the investment in technology to reduce the tasking hours. We've been doing that very effectively. Secondly is the improvement in customer service with those changes. And then finally, the overall sales productivity and sales per square foot productivity at the stores. And I think we've given some examples: the digital signs in appliances; digital signs in lumber; the investments we're making in the Pro area; the investments we've made on the front end. And so I think the overall investment thesis that we have in driving this PPI really speaks to choppy times or good times that we have to leverage the business. \nBrian Nagel: Got it. That's very helpful. And my follow-up question, with regard to sales, clearly, for Q1, then given the commentary with regard to May, I mean, sales have stayed very, very strong, rather broad-based. But as you look at your business on kind of a market-by-market basis, are you seeing any difference in sales trends in regions of the country, markets of the country, that have opened up faster, where, presumably, consumers are getting back to what -- to their normal lives quicker? \nMarvin Ellison: Brian, it's been -- when we talk about broad-based, it's more consistently broad-based than any time I can remember in my career. I mean we have 15 geographic regions and 3 divisions. And as I had said in my prepared comments, I mean all of our regions were in north of 18%, all divisions north of 20%. And when we look at top 40 markets or look at our top metropolitan areas, it is just surprisingly strong and consistent, with very few outliers in the negative. \n And so that points to us that there are just good underlying financial metrics and balance sheet positive aspects for customers that is showing up in how they spend in our business. It also demonstrates that we're running a more consistent business. But the short answer is we're not seeing any negative outliers. When we look at customer mobility with -- and even when we were seeing COVID spikes around the country and vaccination rates, we still didn't see any major differences in overall revenue performance in those pockets of the country. So we feel good about that. And it points to what we believe will be very positive signs for the rest of the year, and that's what we're hoping and praying for. \nOperator: Our final question this morning comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: I wanted to focus on the Pro. You mentioned 30% sales growth in the Pro. But curious if you could sort of remind us or speak to the contributions from existing versus new customer growth. And if there's any sort of quarterly variation in the Pro sales penetration rate that we should be cognizant of as we work our way through 2021. \nMarvin Ellison: Steve, the results from Pro equally balanced between new and existing customers. As Joe mentioned in his prepared comments, the key for us will be just continuing to get a larger percent of wallet of our existing customers. If we didn't attract one new customer and we were able to get a greater percent of spend from existing customers, that would solve our Pro penetration for the next 2-plus years. So that tells you that our greatest opportunity is just getting our existing customers to buy more. But at the same time, with the loyalty program that Joe and his team launched, we're seeing incredible growth in new customers, and we're seeing also customers be very attracted to our new credit program, and that's a great sign for us to see the acquisition of new customers. Joe, I don't know if there's any other points you would make. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. The only thing I would add, we started our journey in the Pro over 2 years ago. We talked a lot about the basics, the price service, the right brands. And now we're focused on that strategic phase of the Pro growth. So things like building out our Pro loyalty database, the new CRM, the redesigned store layout and the tailored shopping experience. So we believe that we have attracted a lot of new customers. We're growing the wallet of our existing customers. And again, I'm very pleased with the Pro team, their focus and everything that, that team has accomplished in the last 2 years. \nSteven Forbes: And then just a quick follow-up, right, regarding Pro wallet share based on the CRM data that you have, right? Any sort of color or current data that you can share as it relates to the wallet share, right, or trip share of the small- and medium-sized Pro customer that you're focused on? \nMarvin Ellison: Steve, we're not going to publicly share a lot of that detail. Obviously, we're tracking it. But for competitive reasons, we typically don't share it externally. What I can tell you is that we've been pleased with the launch of loyalty and CRM, both programs are exceeding expectations. We had some delays, or, I'd say, pauses in the rollout due to COVID, we're now leaning into it. We are excited about the amount of data that we're collecting, and we're more excited about the feedback from our customers on how they feel about the visibility of what they're buying, how they're buying it and just the overall connectivity. So we look forward at some point in the future to sharing more details. But for now, I mean, we're not going to share a lot externally other than to say we feel great about the progress we're making in the trajectory of the business, specifically with that customer. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their continued hard work and commitment to the company. We would also like to extend our thoughts and prayers to our associates in India, who are grappling with an aggressive resurgence of COVID in the country. At Lowe's, we have associates in Bangalore, India in our digital, information technology and finance functions who played a key role in our transformation efforts over the past 2 years. To help our team in India safeguard their health, we sent personal protective equipment to our team members there. We've also made financial commitments to support nonprofit organizations in India that are working to respond to this humanitarian crisis.  \n As we have moved into the second year of the pandemic, we remain focused on our #1 priority, which has always been protecting the health and safety of our associates and communities. And with that in mind, in Q1, we invested nearly $60 million in support of COVID safety protocols.  \n Now turning to our results. Our outstanding performance continued this quarter with total company comparable sales growth of 25.9%. Our U.S. comps were 24.4% with broad-based growth across all geographic regions and divisions. In fact, for the quarter, comp sales for all 15 U.S. regions exceeded 18% and all U.S. divisions exceeded 20%. During the quarter, operating margin expanded 313 basis points on an adjusted basis, leading to diluted earnings per share of $3.21, which is an 81% increase on an adjusted basis over the prior year.  \n Our outperformance in operating margin was supported by our continued transition to an everyday competitive price strategy as well as our disciplined pricing and product cost management strategies. Our improved operating margin also reflects the progress of our operational transformation driven by our perpetual productivity initiatives or PPI. Bill will discuss our everyday competitive price strategy, pricing and product cost management, and Joe will provide details on our PPI initiatives later in the call.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 36.5% on top of 80% growth in the first quarter of 2020, which represents a 9% sales penetration this quarter and a 2-year comp of 146%. With customer demand for an integrated omnichannel shopping experience only increasing, we continue to invest in our omnichannel capabilities. Pro comps outpaced DIY comps with over 30% comps in the quarter. Although this has been a 2-year journey, I'm very pleased with the progress that we made with our Pro customer. We began by addressing the basics, ensuring that we were carrying the brands and products that Pros need in the job lot quantities, and also provided the excellent service this busy customer expects.  \n And now we've shifted to the more strategic phase of growth in the Pro by resetting the layout of our stores with the Pro in mind and deepening our relationship with the Pro through a loyalty program that provides them with members-only benefits. Joe will discuss more about the specific initiatives that we're undertaking to serve the Pro, both online and in-store later in the call.  \n The small- and medium-sized Pro is our target customer. This customer is a frequent shopper who purchases products in multiple departments, which drives increased productivity throughout the store. And I'm confident that we have a compelling growth opportunity as we continue to improve our engagement with this highly valued customer. In addition to the strength in Pro, we delivered over 60% comps along with significant increase in customer satisfaction in our installation services business. \n We've overhauled this business and improved the service offering by consolidating our provider network and implementing industry-leading technology. And although all of us are looking forward to a post-COVID world, our research tells us that the importance of the home will remain elevated for many years to come. And given the increased importance of the home, this quarter, we launched SpringFest, our new reimagined approach to the season. \n Our campaign provided inspiration for home projects so our customers could transport themselves to the destination of their choice without ever leaving the sanctuary of home. In a moment, Bill will discuss the outstanding results that we were able to generate from this reimagination of spring.  \n Now turning to Canada. We delivered comp growth that outpaced the U.S. despite several COVID-related operating restrictions. I'd like to thank the new Canadian leadership team for all of their hard work as well as the frontline associates in Canada for their resilience and commitment to continuing to serve our customers in this challenging operating environment.  \n This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of STAINMASTER brand, which is the most recognized and trusted carpet brand on the market today. With this acquisition, we're building on our decade-long exclusive position as the only national home improvement retailer to carry STAINMASTER carpet. This is an important step in our Total Home strategy as we seek to elevate our product assortment and provide consumers with the products and brands they trust for every project across the entire home. We see great potential to extend the STAINMASTER brand in other product areas where we can continue to leverage its high performance characteristics.  \n This acquisition also expands our private brand portfolio joining the family of private brands, including allen + roth, Kobalt and Project Source. We're focused on expanding our private brand penetration with a balanced brand strategy that includes a powerful national brand portfolio that appeals to both Pro and DIY customers. At the same time, we'll offer a select number of high-value private brands, building consumer loyalty for these products.  \n Our results in the first quarter continue to give me confidence that we're making the right investments to accelerate our market share gains through our Total Home strategy by enhancing our investments in Pro, online, installation services, localization and elevating our product assortment. These initiatives will allow us to drive sustainable growth as we deliver a total home solution for our Pro and our DIY customers.  \n Before I close, I'd like to, once again, extend my appreciation to our frontline associates. In the first quarter, I had an opportunity to visit stores in 9 of our 15 geographic regions. As I observed our associates hard at work serving customers through very challenging circumstances, my respect and admiration continues to grow. In recognition of these efforts, we decided to close our stores and distribution centers on Easter Sunday for the second year in a row to give our associates a much deserved day off to spend with their families and loved ones. \n I'm also pleased to announce that for the fifth consecutive quarter, 100% of our stores earned a Winning Together profit-sharing bonus, a record $152 million payout to our frontline hourly associates. This represents an incremental $70 million above the target level. While the near-term macro outlook remains uncertain, we're confident that we will continue to outperform the market driving both market share gains and improved operating efficiency.  \n Our 2-year plus journey to transform Lowe's has given us improved operating capabilities and a technology infrastructure that's dramatically enhanced, which in turn makes us more agile and able to respond quickly to any potential changes in the business environment. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Simeon, this is Marvin. We purposely have not set a target for Pro penetration. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we really started focusing on the basics. And now we're elevating to a more strategic phase in Pro. We also stated a while back that we estimate our Pro penetration today as between 20% and 25%. Now having said that, based on my history in this business, in the space, in Joe's history and experience in this space, we can see over time our Pro penetration getting between 30% and 35%. And we think that's the trajectory that we're currently on, but we have purposely not set a target because I've learned in the past when you set a target then you can oftentimes hit the target, but you do it at the expense of running a good business, and we're just really focused on serving the customer right now. Yes. Simeon, it's a good question. I'll take the first part. I'll let Dave provide any financial perspective. But I mean we're very excited and we're very bullish on the home improvement industry in general. If you look at the macro factors that really impact this business and have historically impacted this business as things like low mortgage rates, rising home prices, the age of housing stock, improved household formation trends and also strong consumer balance sheets, I mean all of those specific macro factors are pointed in the right direction for us. In addition to that, when there's home price appreciation, that actually benefits home improvement. It may not benefit the overall housing market, but when consumers decide to stay in their existing home and make investments in upgrading the home, that correlates to really strong home improvement sales. \n And as the housing stock continues to age, we're in a repair and maintenance business, that's a significant part of what we do. So when we look at home improvement, we see really robust year-over-year growth potential relative to the macro. And then if we look at just the things that we control. I mean we've been very transparent that there have been many strategic mistakes made in this business over the past 5-plus years. And so we have what we believe is enormous upside in revenue and operating income by continuing to invest in really smart, strategic initiatives that we think will drive the business forward. And we think Q1 reflects our ability to do that with our gross margin and operating and comp performance. I'll let Dave add any additional comments if he has them. And Michael, this is Marvin. The only point I'll add to that is we were up against a 20.4% comp in the month of April in the U.S., and we comped almost 14% on top of that. So we feel really good about that. That exceeded our expectations, we think exceeded our internal plans. And it also demonstrates to us that even going up against some of the spike demand from last year, we still can perform at a high level. So we actually felt great about our performance in April. But it demonstrates when you're up against significant surge in demand, you're going to see sales comp pressure, and that's to be expected. Michael, coming from someone who has worked in a couple of different retail formats, I've always said that home improvement has probably the most suspect market share data on a short-term basis of any retail segment. So to be quite candid, when we look at the amount of growth we delivered in the sales revenue that we generated and we look at it on a 1-year or 2-year comp basis, we can't [ quabble ] about losing market share. \n We're really focused on the broader market. And we've said consistently that in this COVID environment, and this is going to be current and post-COVID, the retailers that are: most capitalized and can make investments in omnichannel and omnichannel fulfillment; and creating different channels with customers to shop; and can lean into technology; and can also leverage the supply base as our merchants and supply chain were able to do over the past quarter will win and will take broader market share. And we believe that we did that. And so we feel very, very comfortable with our market share position and performance and with our prospects for the rest of the year. And Chris, this is Marvin. You can appreciate the challenge we have, looking at the overall macro outlook for the business with all the dynamics occurring in the marketplace. The good news is, is the better the macro performs, the better we'll perform. We feel great about the things that we control and some of the tools and some of the processes we put in place and some of the decisions of the leadership team are really paying dividends. And as David said a couple of times already today, we're committed to outperforming the broader market and improving operating margin. And if the macro improves significantly above the robust scenario then our business will perform equally as well. And that's how we're approaching it. I will -- I'll start it off. What I can tell you is we're just really pleased that the merchants were able to create such strong supply relationships that we could keep up with demand in an unprecedented environment of unit demand. So I'll let Bill talk about units and how we're performing and kind of how we feel about the rest of the year. Scott, this is Marvin. I think it goes directly to our total home market acceleration strategy where we talk about continuing to invest in online, which is really more omnichannel focused, making sure that we're investing in our installation services business and also improving our overall performance with the Pro. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, I mean all of our customer segments are really important, and we are focused more intently on being a customer-focused business. The Pro adds a different dimension because of the frequency of how the Pros shop and also how the Pro shops throughout the entire store. And one of the strategic mistakes made in the past here is not understanding that customer and understanding the economic value of that customer. \n So we're going to continue to stay really focused on that customer. But I would say those 3 things, omnichannel, ensuring that we can continue to have a really robust and seamless installation service business and focusing on the Pro are 3 of our priorities. But the whole Total Home strategy encompasses what we're going to be leaning into for the next couple of years. We're not seeing it. I'll give you thoughts. I'll let Dave give a more financial perspective. I mean we feel really good about this business and this business model. As I look at home improvement as an overall retail sector, I just think that even though we're all just totally fatigued, both mentally, physically with the pandemic, and there's nothing that we can say positive about operating through with all the health and safety issues that we've all dealt with both business and personal, when you look at the macro for home improvement, it's a very positive backdrop. And as we look at forward-looking quarters and into next year, even with the inflation we're seeing in certain areas, specifically lumber and copper, we just don't believe that that's going to create an impediment for growth or significant headwinds for this business sector. \n I'll let Dave add any other comments. Brian, it's been -- when we talk about broad-based, it's more consistently broad-based than any time I can remember in my career. I mean we have 15 geographic regions and 3 divisions. And as I had said in my prepared comments, I mean all of our regions were in north of 18%, all divisions north of 20%. And when we look at top 40 markets or look at our top metropolitan areas, it is just surprisingly strong and consistent, with very few outliers in the negative. \n And so that points to us that there are just good underlying financial metrics and balance sheet positive aspects for customers that is showing up in how they spend in our business. It also demonstrates that we're running a more consistent business. But the short answer is we're not seeing any negative outliers. When we look at customer mobility with -- and even when we were seeing COVID spikes around the country and vaccination rates, we still didn't see any major differences in overall revenue performance in those pockets of the country. So we feel good about that. And it points to what we believe will be very positive signs for the rest of the year, and that's what we're hoping and praying for. Steve, the results from Pro equally balanced between new and existing customers. As Joe mentioned in his prepared comments, the key for us will be just continuing to get a larger percent of wallet of our existing customers. If we didn't attract one new customer and we were able to get a greater percent of spend from existing customers, that would solve our Pro penetration for the next 2-plus years. So that tells you that our greatest opportunity is just getting our existing customers to buy more. But at the same time, with the loyalty program that Joe and his team launched, we're seeing incredible growth in new customers, and we're seeing also customers be very attracted to our new credit program, and that's a great sign for us to see the acquisition of new customers. Joe, I don't know if there's any other points you would make. Steve, we're not going to publicly share a lot of that detail. Obviously, we're tracking it. But for competitive reasons, we typically don't share it externally. What I can tell you is that we've been pleased with the launch of loyalty and CRM, both programs are exceeding expectations. We had some delays, or, I'd say, pauses in the rollout due to COVID, we're now leaning into it. We are excited about the amount of data that we're collecting, and we're more excited about the feedback from our customers on how they feel about the visibility of what they're buying, how they're buying it and just the overall connectivity. So we look forward at some point in the future to sharing more details. But for now, I mean, we're not going to share a lot externally other than to say we feel great about the progress we're making in the trajectory of the business, specifically with that customer."

            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. I'll begin this morning with a few comments on the company's robust capital allocation program. In Q1, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow driven by improved operational execution and continued strong consumer demand. We returned $3.5 billion to our shareholders through both a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  \n During the quarter, we paid $440 million in dividends at $0.60 per share. We also repurchased 16.8 million shares for $3.1 billion at an average price of approximately $182 a share. We have approximately $17 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Capital expenditures totaled $461 million in the quarter as we invest in our strategic initiatives to drive the business and to support our growth. We ended the quarter with $6.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, which includes proceeds from our $2 billion notes offering in March. In addition, we entered into a $1 billion term loan facility in April, which remains undrawn.  \n Our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with adjusted debt to EBITDAR at 2.07x at the end of the quarter, well below our long-term target of 2.75x.  \n Now turning to the income statement. In Q1, we generated diluted earnings per share of $3.21, an increase of 81% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share last year. This growth was due to strong sales growth, improved gross margin rate and SG&A leverage as a result of a strong execution across many facets of our business.  \n Please note that in the prior year quarter, there was a very modest impact on diluted earnings per share related to the Canadian restructuring effort. My comments from this point forward will include approximations when appropriate and comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures where applicable. \n Strong sales growth was driven by several factors, including: a continued consumer focused on the home; a favorable weather backdrop across the country; commodity inflation, especially within the lumber category; consumer support from the March government stimulus package; and our improved execution as we continue to elevate our product and service offerings. Q1 sales were $24.4 billion driven by a comparable sales increase of 25.9%. This was a result of a balanced contribution for both ticket and transactions as comparable average store ticket grew 14.1% and transaction count grew 11.8%, with strong repeat rates from both new and existing customers.  \n While a little difficult to measure, we estimate that the March government stimulus checks drove 300 basis points of growth, while commodity inflation benefited comps by 460 basis points in the quarter. Lumber and other commodity prices remained at elevated levels versus last year. U.S. comp sales were up 24.4% in the quarter, consistent with the results from the past few quarters. Growth was well balanced across DIY and Pro customers, selling channels, geographies and nearly all merchandise departments.  \n Our U.S. comps were 24% in February, 35.9% in March and 13.9% in April. February comps were negatively impacted by the harsh winter storms that hit Texas and several other states, while March were positively impacted by storm recovery and the third round of stimulus. Additionally, we began cycling last year's COVID-related spikes in demand in the second half of April and those more difficult comparisons impacted April comps.  \n Looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2019 to '21, February sales increased 30.3%, March increased 48.1% and April increased 37.1%. Gross margin was 33.29%, up 19 basis points from last year and up 183 basis points as compared to Q1 of '19. Product margin rate improved 165 basis points. As Bill mentioned, our teams effectively leveraged our merchandising excellence strategy to manage product cost and retail pricing throughout the quarter.  \n While we are seeing inflation in some product categories, our merchants work to diligently mitigate and minimize vendor cost increases. Additionally, our supply chain team leveraged our scale and carrier relationships to minimize distribution cost pressures experienced throughout the retail sector.  \n On the pricing side, our shift to an everyday competitive price strategy continue to benefit our margins in Q1 as we leverage enhanced pricing tools to improve margin across the array of products that we sell. We began to see improving trends from our increased focus on shrink control this quarter, with shrink improving sequentially from Q4 of 2020. However, results pressured gross margin by 15 basis points versus last year. We expect that our shrink performance will continue to improve as we move throughout the year.  \n These benefits to product margin rate were partially offset by: 90 basis points of pressure from product mix shifts due to lumber inflation and a less favorable product mix; 20 basis points of pressure from supply chain cost as we continue to invest in our omnichannel capabilities; and 20 basis points of pressure from credit revenue.  \n SG&A of 18.4% levered 288 basis points compared to adjusted SG&A in LY driven primarily by lower COVID-related costs as well as operating cost leverage resulting from strong sales and our ongoing productivity from our PPI initiative. As anticipated, we incurred nearly $60 million of COVID-related expenses as compared to approximately $320 million of COVID-related expenses last year. The $260 million reduction in these expenses generated 140 basis points of SG&A leverage. \n Additionally, strong sales and a focus on efficiency and productivity allowed us to generate leverage of 100 basis points in operating salaries, 35 basis points in occupancy expense and 5 basis points in advertising. \n Now operating profit was $3.2 billion, an increase of 63% over LY. Operating margins of 13.3% of sales for the quarter was up 317 basis points to the prior year driven by both improved operating leverage and improved gross margin rate. The effective tax rate was 23.5%. The tax rate was slightly lower than expected primarily due to a tax benefit related to the divesting of certain employee stock options. We continue to build up our inventory levels throughout the quarter to meet the sustained high levels of customer demand while improving our in-stock position.  \n At quarter end, inventory was $18.4 billion, up $2.2 billion from Q4 levels, in line with seasonal patterns. This reflects an increase of $4.1 billion from Q1 of 2020 when inventory levels were pressured due to unexpected spikes in demand as well as COVID-related supply disruptions. Of note, this includes a year-over-year increase of $780 million related specifically to inflation. \n Now before I close, let me comment on our current trends and how we are planning our business for the balance of 2021. Our year-to-date results are tracking ahead of the robust market scenario that we covered in our December investor update. The underlying drivers of home improvement demand appear to be more resilient and stable than we originally forecasted. Those factors build our confidence in our ability to deliver strong results on top of an exceptional year in 2020, including 12% operating margins and flat gross margin rates for the year. We remain confident that our Total Home strategy will enable us to capture market share. \n We are very encouraged by our performance in Q1, including our strong sales volume even as we began to cycle last year's mid-April surge in demand. Month to date, May U.S. comp sales trends are materially consistent with April performance levels on a 2-year comparable basis. Looking forward, year-over-year comparisons remain difficult throughout the remainder of the year. Also, we continue to see COVID restrictions in some areas across Canada. As markets reopen, we are closely monitoring consumer behavior, anticipating a potential modest shift in spending away from the home. We remain agile and ready to respond to whatever environment we face this year with our focus on gaining market share throughout 2021, while improving operating margins. \n With regards to our quarterly performance, please note that we are cycling particularly high gross margin levels in Q2 of LY. In the prior quarter, there was an industry-wide pullback in promotions and a more favorable product mix. As a result, we currently anticipate a moderate decline in gross margin rates in Q2. Despite this moderate year-over-year decline, our gross margin rate is expected to expand nicely over pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Investments in pricing, vendor cost management and our everyday competitive promotional strategy have been driving improvements in our gross margin performance over the past 2 years.  \n As I stated earlier, we continue to expect to deliver flat gross margin rates for 2021. Further, we expect the business to generate robust levels of free cash flow. We plan to invest $2 billion in CapEx this year to drive future growth and returns as we continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation with $9 billion in planned share repurchases this year while also supporting our dividend. In closing, we are very excited about the momentum in our business and our ability to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term. \n With that, we are now ready for questions. Thank you. Yes. Simeon, the only other thing that I would add is that obviously, over the next several years, we anticipated that the millennial customer would begin to migrate into the home ownership position. I think what has happened through COVID is that macro trend has probably accelerated. So probably given the industry segment a bit more tailwinds as we think about the next several years. Liz, this is Dave. I'll start with that question there. I think what you're looking at here is we have a very specific investment thesis really as we launched it in 2020 and into '21. And I think if you look at the thesis that we have and all the priorities that we have, I think we feel like we're very well positioned making the right investments to grow our business long term, improve our operating performance. \n I do think we're also very focused on the fact that we can't really predict the macro in the back half of this year, but we are very committed to doing 2 things: one is we're going to grow market share this year; and two, we're going to improve our operating margin performance. And we do expect that to be -- if the market holds up with a robust or above robust, around 12% operating margin, and that's our focus for this year. Yes. I'll -- First, as you look at, I guess, our performance by month through the quarter, if you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, yes, March was somewhat inflated if you think about tech, the recovery from the storm in Texas and other states as well as stimulus hitting that period. So I think we feel very good about kind of how we ended the quarter and the trends as we cycle into May from a sales perspective. And I think, listen, we're not giving guidance for the quarter. We continue to be focused specifically on making sure that we have great service. We have -- that we're in stock in the right categories, and we're supporting our consumers across our marketplace. And I feel like we're gaining momentum as we think about our business, both in 2020 and here as we cycle into '21. Yes. Listen, I think -- this is Dave. We've had -- we've made a lot of investments from a product cost management and pricing perspective infrastructure here at Lowe's and feel very confident between the merchant and finance team on kind of managing that. It is not necessarily seasonally related. This is really about managing our everyday price and cost in a more effective manner overtime. I do think that we're still in the early stages of this journey as we think about the next several years to improve our performance here. Clearly, at the moment, we're -- as we said in our prepared remarks, there are some inflation pressures in our business that we're managing through. I do believe that we have -- we're continuing to invest in these tools and technologies to enable us to improve our margin performance over the longer term. \n Now keep in mind, Chris, I just want to go back to what we said of our long-term financial algorithm here is really to maintain kind of flattish gross margins over time with the fact that we would improve the product margin, but we'll reinvest some of that product margin in the supply chain to drive performance and growth over the long term. Yes. Chris, I just want to get ourselves focused. Listen, first and foremost, we've said about the fact that we've got to gain some market share. We've got to improve operating margin performance here, and we're trying to get to our 12% in the short term here. Beyond 12%, we have objectives and we believe we can expand it further, but let's at least get to our 12% margin first. And so we're just kind of laser-focused on making sure that we're delivering upon our commitments from that perspective. Yes. Chuck, that business is in the mid-single digits penetration for our business. And we do think we have a big runway here. As Joe indicated in his prepared remarks, is that business was something that really wasn't invested in historically and was something that we had a really, I'd say, poor service model historically and was not the best from an operating performance perspective financially. I think we've now turned that business around and have a really nice foundation as we think about growing it. So I'll ask Joe to give a couple of comments on it. Yes. The only thing I would add is -- just to reconfirm what Marvin said, we see no slowdown in demand at this point in time across our business and our categories. And I think if you speak to our Pro customers, we're hearing from them that they, one, are very busy at the moment, and two, have extremely long backlogs at this point in time. So I think this demand will continue for some period of time. Yes. So obviously -- this is Dave. Obviously, the biggest expense lever we have is how we manage operating salaries across our business and probably labor a little bit in the supply chain. I think what we've done is we've -- we have invested in tools, in processes to really allow us to effectively manage that labor component and really adjust it based on demand that we're seeing from a profile perspective. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. We delivered U.S. comparable sales growth of 24.4% in the first quarter. Our compelling offerings, great values and improved in-stocks allowed us to capitalize on the continued strong demand for home improvement products. Consistent with recent trends, growth was broad-based across Pro and DIY customers, in store and online and across product categories. In fact, 13 of 15 merchandising departments generated comps over 15% and all merchandising departments were up more than 20% on a 2-year comp basis.  \n As Marvin described, we were extremely pleased with how consumers responded to our SpringFest event. Similar to our approach to the winter holidays, we extended this event across 4 weeks to create a new sense of excitement and to prompt return trips, while also avoiding congestion in our stores. We offered 4 different weekly giveaways of garden-to-go kits that provided everything needed for a fun spring project, and also strengthen our customer connection through a required MyLowe's activation online. The success of this event was due to the great organizational alignment across our stores, marketing and merchant teams.  \n Turning now to our top-performing categories. Lumber again delivered the highest comp driven by strong Pro demand and unprecedented inflation in the category. Over the past year, as lumber products have been in tight supply, our merchants have worked closely with our suppliers and successfully secured new sources and additional product to ensure that we can maintain a competitive in-stock position in the category.  \n Strong in-stocks in this tight market have allowed us to continue to strengthen customer relationships, especially with the Pro. In addition to lumber, we delivered comps exceeding 30% in electrical, decor, kitchens and bath and seasonal and outdoor living. Our electrical category posted strong comps in the quarter driven by inflation in copper as well as solid demand from the robust repair/remodel market.  \n In support of our total home market share acceleration strategy, we drove strong engagement with our customers as reflected by increased sales in decor and kitchens and bath. The strong sales in our decor category were driven by great performance in home accents as we continue to elevate our product assortments, especially with our recently refreshed allen + roth brand. In fact, this quarter, our merchant teams launched new spring collections that span across the broad array of product categories through a lifestyle point of view with inspirational on-trend designs that gives our customers the confidence they need to decorate their homes in style.  \n Our kitchens and bath department outperformed in the quarter as homeowners continue to enhance their living spaces and economic stimulus supported bigger ticket projects. Finally, seasonal and outdoor living benefited from the early demand in patio and grills as homeowners embrace the arrival of spring.  \n We also saw strong sales in the newly launched battery-powered EGO and SKIL brands as consumers are attracted to the convenience and the quality of their zero-emission rechargeable outdoor power equipment. In fact, during the quarter, EGO delivered some of their largest weekly sales results in the history of their brand. The addition of EGO and SKIL has only strengthened our #1 position in outdoor power equipment and truly complements the leading brands we carry such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Ariens, and CRAFTSMAN. \n And during the quarter, we continued to see strong demand for our other powerhouse brands like Weber and Char-Broil, which remain the top 2 brands in outdoor grilling. We were excited to add new brands to our arsenal, including the exclusive launch of FLEX cordless power tools. The FLEX brand is known by the most discerning builders, contractors and trade professionals, and this new lineup of power tools offers the latest innovation, more power and faster charging than the competition.  \n We are also excited to bring the LESCO brand of fertilizer to Lowe's this spring, a brand that is trusted by landscape pros and knowledgeable homeowners alike. The addition of FLEX power tools and LESCO fertilizer further complements our powerful Pro brand lineup which already includes Simpson Strong-Tie, DEWALT, Spyder, Bosch, Eaton and SharkBite.  \n As Marvin mentioned, we delivered strong sales growth of 36.5% and a 2-year growth of 146% on Lowes.com. We continue to enhance the online customer experience with improved search and navigation functionality that allows consumers to easily shop for products across categories. Additionally, we continue to see strong download rates of our mobile app as we are working to enhance our customer loyalty through a great mobile experience.  \n As Marvin mentioned, we delivered a solid improvement in our product margins this quarter driven by disciplined vendor cost management, improved and enhanced pricing systems and our continued transition to a more relevant everyday competitive price strategy that is complemented by targeted seasonally relevant promotions. All of these initiatives are part of our ongoing merchandising excellence strategy. We will continue to leverage and refine these capabilities as we deliver strong everyday values to our consumers, while we continue to manage our product margins by taking a data-driven portfolio approach to pricing.  \n Our Total Home strategy will continue to allow us to expand and elevate our product and brand assortments and take market share. \n Before I close, I want to thank our vendor partners and our merchants for their continued focus on taking care of our stores and our customers. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Yes. Liz, this is Bill. So all categories achieved the plus-20% draw on a 2-year basis, but the 2 categories below the company were paint and our hardware business, driven largely because of everybody painting last year during the pandemic. And then the hardware business driven by safety and masks and some of that business that spiked last year in the quarter. Yes. Chuck, I think, to echo Marvin, I think demand continues to remain strong and all the preparation that was done coming off of last year has certainly enabled us to fulfill that demand going forward. All the work that's being done right now is to maintain that as we go through the rest of the year and continue to manage the needs of the Pro customer, make sure that we can take care of them first. I mean that's really what we're focused on in that job lot quantity and making sure that we're right by market, and that's been the focus of the team."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our associates were laser-focused on providing excellent customer service, supporting a safe store environment and delivering record sales volumes. As Marvin mentioned, 100% of our stores earned Winning Together profit-sharing bonus, a record $152 million payout to our frontline hourly associates. I would like to thank our associates for their continued dedication in providing world-class customer service. \n As Marvin mentioned, our focus on perpetual productivity improvement or our PPI initiative continued to yield results during this quarter as we leverage store payroll by using technology to reduce tasking hours, improve customer service and increase sales productivity. For example, we rolled out digital signs first in appliances, and most recently, in our lumber department. These signs cut down on associate tasking labor and they also support better product margin performance as we can now more rapidly implement price changes in line with the market.  \n We are also leveraging an improved freight flow app, creating a fully digital process that gives our associates better line of sight to when products will arrive at our stores. The app which was developed in-house, even help store associates to prioritize the incoming merchandise so they can quickly and efficiently position the product on the sales floor for our customers.  \n And we launched secure mobile checkout, which we are using to improve speed of service in high-traffic areas inside the store and on the exterior of the store in areas such as outside lawn and garden and under the Pro canopy. This checkout app developed in-house is allowing us to take care of customers from scanning items, tendering payment and printing or e-mailing receipts before they even join the line. Our customers are delighted with the solution, especially on busy weekends.  \n We are also driving productivity in our in-store fulfillment. This quarter, we expanded our contactless shopping options by completing the rollout of BOPIS lockers to 100% of our U.S. stores in April. Customers really enjoy these touchless easy-to-use lockers. In fact, this has already become the highest-rated store fulfillment options. Having BOPIS lockers in 100% of our U.S. stores will allow us to expand our omnichannel capabilities, further improve customer satisfaction and limit customer congestion at our service desk.  \n Turning to our Pros. As Marvin mentioned, Pro outpaced DIY in the quarter with over 30% comps. We continue to gain momentum with the Pro through our improved in-stock inventory levels, our enhanced service offerings and our new Pro loyalty program. Our Pro sales associates have also begun to leverage our new CRM platform to proactively engage with our Pro customers and sell the entire project to them. Our most compelling growth opportunity with the Pro is expanding the share of wallet with our existing customers.  \n Our new CRM platform as well as the redesigned store layout that aligns product adjacencies enable us to more effectively serve their needs for the entire project across all of their jobs. And we continue to enhance the shopping experience for our Pro customers, small- to medium-sized businesses who are always pressed for time. We are launching a tailored shopping experience created specifically for Pros to ensure that the time they spend away from their job site is efficient and productive.  \n We're introducing new convenience products at checkout and services like dedicated Pro trailer parking and phone charging stations, all designed to help add value to each trip the Pros take, thus cutting down on the number of stops they make throughout the day. We're also enhancing their online experiences with the ongoing migration of Lowe's for Pros to the cloud. This will give our Pro customers access to incremental options that our DIY customers already have on Lowes.com, and it will allow us to more quickly add new Pro-only features in the future, including a personalized app experience.  \n Both in-store and online, we continue to demonstrate that Lowe's is on a mission to be the new home for Pros. As Marvin mentioned, we are seeing terrific momentum in our installation business with over 60% comps this quarter. As a reminder, just 2 years ago, this was a money-losing business with poor customer satisfaction. Although we are lapping Q1 2020 results that were pressured by COVID, we are very pleased with the overall execution and trajectory of this business.  \n In closing, I cannot be more pleased with the improvements we are making in our stores as reflected in our strong Net Promoter Scores and a recent third-party study. Our executive officer, senior officers, merchants and field leaders are out visiting stores on a weekly basis to ensure that we are listening to and supporting our frontline associates. This remains a very difficult environment to operate retail stores in and I could not be prouder of the accomplishments of this team and their commitment and hard work from our frontline associates. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. Yes. Thanks, Dave. I'll just make a few comments. You heard in my prepared remarks the performance, very, very pleased that we've attracted industry veterans that really understand the complexities of being inside the home, and especially in the COVID environment, in all the platforms that we have been focused on, the consolidation of installers across the country, and remaining laser-focused on the programs that we really want to drive, and that's all under the same umbrella as our Total Home strategy. So we're very pleased with the team's efforts. I'm very pleased with all of our installer partners across the country and looking forward to a great continued momentum here. Brian, thanks for the question. And I will point out the 3 major points of the PPI initiative that we talk about. First is the investment in technology to reduce the tasking hours. We've been doing that very effectively. Secondly is the improvement in customer service with those changes. And then finally, the overall sales productivity and sales per square foot productivity at the stores. And I think we've given some examples: the digital signs in appliances; digital signs in lumber; the investments we're making in the Pro area; the investments we've made on the front end. And so I think the overall investment thesis that we have in driving this PPI really speaks to choppy times or good times that we have to leverage the business. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. The only thing I would add, we started our journey in the Pro over 2 years ago. We talked a lot about the basics, the price service, the right brands. And now we're focused on that strategic phase of the Pro growth. So things like building out our Pro loyalty database, the new CRM, the redesigned store layout and the tailored shopping experience. So we believe that we have attracted a lot of new customers. We're growing the wallet of our existing customers. And again, I'm very pleased with the Pro team, their focus and everything that, that team has accomplished in the last 2 years."

Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. \n During the call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2023. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. \n Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, our total company comparable sales declined 1.5%, while U.S. comps decreased 0.7%. \n For the quarter, commodity deflation impacted U.S. comps by 75 basis points. Our investments in the Pro customers continue to pay dividends for the company reflected by our continued strong Pro sales in the fourth quarter. In fact, this is the 11th consecutive quarter that we've driven double-digit Pro growth in the U.S. despite stronger-than-expected commodity deflation. \n And while there was continued solid DIY demand in core home improvement categories, as expected, we saw a DIY pullback on holiday gift buying. Despite a modest decrease in sales, we once again improved our adjusted operating margin by maintaining our disciplined focus on productivity. \n During the quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded approximately 88 basis points leading to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.28, a 28% increase compared to last year. These results cap off solid financial performance for fiscal 2022 with sales of $97.1 billion, adjusted operating margin of 13%, and adjusted earnings per share of $13.81\t up 15% over the prior year. \n With these results, we're awarding $220 million in discretionary and profit-sharing bonuses to our associates, which includes an incremental $70 million for our assistant store managers and supply chain supervisors who hold 2 of the most critical frontline leadership roles in the company. This builds on our recent $170 million investment in permanent wage increases for our frontline, hourly associates, which went into effect in December. \n Since 2018, we've invested over $3 billion in incremental wages and share-based compensation for our frontline associates, including increasing associate wages by over 20%. And as we mentioned at our December Analyst and Investor Conference, we are committed to additional frontline wage investments over the next several years, which are contemplated in our long-term targets. These compensation investments are just one reflection of our commitment to becoming the employer of choice in retail, which Joe will discuss in more detail. \n Throughout the quarter, we continued to gain traction with our Total Home Strategy as consumers remain engaged in home-related activities. In Pro, we delivered U.S. growth of 10% and 36% on a 2-year basis. We are capitalizing on our momentum with our Pro by growing our MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program, building relationships through our CRM tool and continuing to enhance our product assortment to meet Pro needs. \n One example of enhancing our Pro product assortment is the exciting news that client tools will be coming back to Lowe's. We know that our Pros are officially loyal to certain national brands and Klein is the #1 hand tool brand among electrical and HVAC professionals. This creates immediate credibility across trades. Bill will share more detail on this exciting addition to our assortment later in the call. \n Now one question many of you have asked is about our Pro backlog and if they're still healthy. We're in constant communication with our Pros through formal surveys, our Pro counsel and countless day-to-day conversations. In our January survey, more than 70% of Pros stated that they were booked out the same or more compared to 2022, and they remain confident in their ability to find jobs and hold on to their backlog. We believe this dynamic is being fueled by all the things we talked about at our December Analyst and Investor Conference, which includes homeowners with strong balance sheets and record levels of equity. \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 5% on top of 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, partly due to strong appliance sales. This represents a 2-year comp of 17% and more than 11% sales penetration. We continue to remove friction from the customers' online experience, which includes adding Apple Pay this quarter to improve conversion. \n We're also focused on removing friction from our customers' omnichannel shopping journeys, like for appliances where customers often shop our showrooms before making their purchase online. We also continue to make strides in the rollout of our market delivery model for appliances and other big and bulky products. \n We added 2 new geographic areas this quarter, bringing us to 10 geographic regions across the country supporting more than 1,000 stores. And as a reminder, in the market-based delivery model, big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers' homes replacing our inefficient store delivery model. This delivery model is enabling us to further consolidate our industry leadership position in appliances and it positions us for profitable growth and other big and bulky product categories like grills, riding lawnmowers and stock cabinets. \n Turning to Canada. We completed the sale of our Canadian retail business to Sycamore Partners this quarter. As a result, we are now solely focused on the transformation of our U.S. business, where we estimate we have a $1 trillion addressable home improvement market, enabling us to invest more into higher-return opportunities to grow our business and to take market share. I'd like to extend my appreciation to the entire Canadian team for their commitment to serving our customers, and I wish them the best as they move forward under new ownership. \n Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market. And as you know, there is a wide range of conflicting opinions on what's going to happen in the macro environment in 2023. From our perspective, the core drivers of our business, disposable personal income, home price appreciation, and the age of housing stock, remain supportive. Consumer savings are still roughly $1.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic with 85% concentrated in the top 40% of income earners who are more likely to be homeowners. Homeowners continue to enjoy record levels of equity in their homes, nearly $330,000 on average. Even if there is a modest decline in home prices, the level of equity built up during the pandemic would not be meaningfully eroded. And the housing stock continues to age with 50% of U.S. homes over 41 years old, the oldest since World War II. \n These factors, along with strong millennial household formation, baby boomers' increasing preference to age in place and more widespread remote work will continue to be tailwinds for our business. \n And given the slowdown in housing turnover is driven by higher rates and low supply rather than demand, we continue to see a nationwide trend of trading up in place with consumers opting to upgrade their existing home to meet their evolving needs. All of these dynamics give us confidence in the medium- and longer-term outlook for the industry. \n That being said, we also know that consumers are weary of a potential recession, which is reflected in some of the discretionary pullback we experienced during the holiday season. We're closely monitoring trends and we have a proven playbook to pivot quickly if the macro softens. \n Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrate our operational agility, which is reflected in our ability to leverage expenses and deliver productivity in a negative comp sales environment. This gives our experienced leadership team confidence in our ability to effectively manage the business in a wide variety of macro scenario. \n In closing, I'd like to thank our frontline associates for their commitment to serving customers day in and day out. As I travel to country every week visiting stores, I continue to be impressed by their passion for helping customers and their communities. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, U.S. comparable sales decreased slightly by 0.7%, though sales were up 34.4% on a 3-year basis, reflecting continued momentum with the Pro and resilience in core DIY home improvement demand. \n We delivered positive comps in home decor, fueled by key categories like appliances, paint, and kitchen and bath. And we delivered strong growth in our Building Products division, excluding the impacts of commodity deflation. We are particularly encouraged by the Pro strength we're seeing across categories, including rough plumbing, building materials, paint and millwork as we continue to expand our product and service offerings to meet their needs. \n And consistent with our Total Home Strategy, we continue to add brands relevant to Pros, including 4 new partnerships. First, we're adding a portfolio of drinks from Coca-Cola to reduce the number of stops Pros make before going to the job site, which is important since time is money for these customers. \n Second, we are adding Carhartt Apparel that's popular with both our Pro and our DIY consumer especially in our rural stores. \n Third, we have entered a new national partnership with Hubbell, giving us access to all of their Pro branded electrical boxes, including Bell, TayMac and RACO. And fourth, we are excited to be bringing back client tools. As Marvin mentioned, this is the #1 hand tool brand among electrical and HVAC professionals. So this is just a big deal for us and our Pros. \n We are also really excited to announce that Lowe's will offer the widest selection of client products anywhere in the home improvement retail channel, which will be available in the second half of 2023. \n Our initial selection of client tools will include hand tools and electrical test and measurement tools, followed by a multiyear rollout of new product innovations. Fine Tools, Hubble, Carhartt and Coca-Cola are strong additions to our Pro brand arsenal, which already includes other great brands like Bosch, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner. \n As we gain momentum with the Pro, we continue to see brands come to Lowe's and in many cases, come back to Lowe's because they recognize our newfound recommitment to the Pro and see the opportunity to grow with us. \n Shifting to our merchandising division performance for the quarter. In home decor, appliances, paint and kitchens and baths led the way. Appliances grew across both Pro and DIY as we continue to gain market share in this critical category. Growth was bolstered by our new instant savings capability that automatically applies supplier rebates to a customer's order, making it much easier and faster for them to take advantage of these offers, which are supported by the manufacturer. This replaces our cumbersome mail-in rebates with real-time savings, both in stores and online to remove friction for the customer and improve conversion. This innovation is another example of Lowe's leapfrogging the competition with technology that not only improves the customer experience, but also drives labor productivity. \n Paint was another standout category with solid pro-growth fueled by our MVPs Pro Paint Rewards and Pro JobSIGHT delivery. We're also seeing an uptick in paint attachments items like applicators, paint sundries and caulk as we upgrade our paint departments across our stores. This upgrade is strategically designed to make it easier for our customers to get everything they need in one trip. \n We also began the launch of STAINMASTER paint, a high-quality, high-value solution for busy families looking to protect their walls from fingerprints and other messes. This is Lowe's first-ever private brand paint and early results are already outperforming our expectations. \n Our focus on driving private brand penetration is well timed enabling us to capitalize on the nationwide trend of increasing customer preference for private brands. \n Another category that outperformed this quarter is kitchens and bath. We were particularly encouraged to see a strong increase in demand for custom cabinets driven by improved lead times as well as an expanded suite of digital tools, along with our team of talented virtual designers, all of which help our customers tailor the right solutions for their budgets and design preferences. \n Turning to the Building Products division. We delivered strong, broad-based growth, excluding the impacts of commodity deflation across copper and lumber. We delivered strong positive comps across rough plumbing, building materials and millwork driven by Pro demand and continued DIY investment in the home. \n Our performance in hard lines was consistent with broader consumer trends as we saw a decrease in holiday gift buying compared to the prior year. However, the team still delivered a solid holiday season with sell-throughs above 2019 levels. As expected, consumers reverted to more typical holiday buying patterns as compared to last year when we saw a widespread early buying due to supply chain concerns. \n As we look ahead, we continue to build on our customers' preference for new and innovative products with continued enhancements to our product assortments. We are expanding on our popular Kobalt 24-Volt platform with new tools and technology that customers have been asking for, including a cordless Kobalt nailer that can instantly fire 1,100 nails on a single charge, eliminated the need to drag an air compressor and a hose around the job site. \n We're also excited about our new EGO zero turn radius mower with the industry's first e-STEER technology. With the sleek, intuitive steering wheel that increases the driver's control and precision, powered by the EGO battery system that now allows this unit to mow 3 acres on a single charge. \n We are ready to capitalize on spring with the best in-stock positions that we've had in 3 years, right on time to support our biggest selling season of the year. In addition to an enhanced assortment and strong in-stock levels, we're also making strides in driving merchandising productivity as part of our enterprise-wide perpetual productivity improvement initiatives. \n As one of the larger importers in the U.S., we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and reduce our import and domestic transportation costs. As the cost of transportation and raw materials come down, we are working with our suppliers to ensure that our prices are competitive to support sales and to protect our margins. \n We have sophisticated cost optimization tools that track prices of the underlying components of the products we sell. So the teams are well informed for these discussions. We are also holding our suppliers accountable to drive out costs through their productivity just as we are doing throughout our own organization. \n We are also partnering with our suppliers through our Lowe's One Roof Media Network. Some of our top suppliers have already locked in sizable contracts for 2023, and we are excited to partner with them to strategically target the home improvement shopper to drive traffic on Lowes.com and convert to sale. \n Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our merchants and our inventory and supply chain teams, along with our vendor partners for their hard work and continued support throughout 2022. I'm looking forward to what we will accomplish together in 2023 as we continue to find ways to provide value to our shared customers. \n Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for their unwavering commitment to serving our customers and delivering another solid year of operating results. Associates are the heart of any retailer, but even more so in our industry where customers rely on our associates' product knowledge as they look for the right solutions to repair and upgrade their homes. That's why we are so focused on becoming the employer of choice in retail, where associates chose to stay to build their careers. \n As Marvin mentioned, we've made substantial wage investments over the last 4 years, and we constantly review each market and monitor candidate flow to help us remain competitive and maintain a robust hiring pool in all geographic areas of the company. \n Beyond competitive compensation, we offer comprehensive benefits, flexible scheduling options and bonus opportunities. As we close out the year, we are excited to award $220 million in discretionary and profit sharing bonuses. This includes $70 million for our assistant store managers and supply chain supervisors with an incremental $7,500 bonus this quarter on top of their annual incentive bonus, and we are one of only a handful of retailers to offer share-based compensation for our ASMs and which incentivizes them to build their careers at Lowe's. These critical leaders are undoubtedly some of the hardest working leaders in our company, and they are at the forefront of creating a culture focused on exceptional customer service. \n In addition to recognizing these leaders, we are also awarding $150 million to eligible hourly associates in recognition of their efforts this year. Based on continuous associate listening we also added other improvements this quarter, including sick leave for part-time associates in revamping our store break rooms with higher quality, lower-cost, food options. Our investments in our people have helped us build more than 80% of leadership positions from within over the last year with more than 90% of our store leaders starting as hourly associates. \n As we enter spring, our busiest time of year, I'm pleased that we have the best staffing levels that we've had in 3 years. Our focus on associates also translates into how we're serving the Pro, which is our biggest opportunity for growth. This quarter, we launched a Know the Pro training, helping our associates understand how to better serve Pro customers across the entire store, not just at the Pro desk. This training supported storewide participation in key Q4 Pro events, including the most successful PROVember we've ever had as well as our MVPs bonus days, which exceeded expectations. \n I would like to thank our associates, especially our Pro team for delivering outstanding results, driving U.S. Pro comps of 10% for the quarter, 36% on a 2-year basis despite commodity deflation. \n We continue to leverage our MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program to capitalize on this demand by engaging Pros, incentivizing purchases and building long-term loyalty. Our program is designed to make every Pro feel like an MVP regardless of their size, giving small to midsize Pros, access to bonus points, savings and exclusive offers that they can't get elsewhere. \n We're pleased to see the results continue to exceed expectations as reflected in our 200 basis points increase in Pro customer satisfaction scores in Q4. \n Shifting gears to our focus on productivity. We continue to make progress with our PPI or perpetual productivity improvement initiatives. One of the key objectives of PPI is simplifying our associates jobs while removing friction for our customers. This approach allows us to generate productivity and cost savings in the store while simultaneously improving customer service. \n One great example of this is the transition of our outdated legacy technology to our new modern omnichannel systems. We just completed the conversion at our returns desk with easy-to-use touchscreens that enable associates to quickly scan items and process to correct return value, with the system automatically accounting for return policies and promotions. This simplifies the return experience for customers, gives our suppliers more insights to improve product quality, while also making it easier for associates to enforce our policies and manage complex returns. \n We also continue to roll out new tools, including 90,000 additional Zebra smartphones by the end of June, to ensure all associates walking the sales floor have a device, including our MST associates. \n Our leadership team knows that when we make things easier for our associates, they make things easier for our customers. And our new returns process is just one example of the dozens of initiatives underway to do just that. And of course, none of this would be possible without our associates. \n For our associates tuning in, thank you for your ongoing focus on serving customers and driving productivity. We appreciate your hard work. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon. \nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our Q4 results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 compared to $1.78 last year. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. \n Excluding the $441 million of pretax transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business, we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.28, an increase of 28% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. This increase was driven by our continued focus on productivity as well as disciplined capital allocation. Q4 sales were $22.4 billion, which includes approximately $1.4 billion in sales generated in the 14th week. Comparable sales declined 1.5%. \n U.S. comp sales were down 0.7% in the quarter with comp average ticket up 4.8% driven by product inflation and higher Pro sales partly offset by 75 basis points of lumber deflation. This was offset by a comp transaction decline of 5.5%. \n Sales in Canada totaled $958 million, a decline of 18% in USD on a comparable basis, partly driven by exchange rate unfavorability due to a stronger dollar and lumber deflation. \n FX represented a 25 basis point headwind to consolidated comps. Of note, both the Canadian sales decline and lumber deflation pressured our Q4 comps more than expected. U.S. Pro sales were up 10% in the quarter despite lumber and copper deflation. \n On Lowes.com, sales increased 5% in the quarter, partly driven by continued strength in appliance. Our U.S. monthly comps improved as we moved through the quarter, with comps down 3.1% in November due to DIY pullback on discretionary holiday spending. In December, comps were down 0.2%, with comps turning positive in January, up 1.4%, reflecting continued DIY investment in the home. \n Gross margin was 32.3% of sales in the fourth quarter, down 60 basis points from last year. Product margin rate improved 15 basis points versus the prior year. Gross margins also benefited from 30 basis points of favorable product mix due to a lower percentage of lumber sales. \n Higher product margin rate was offset by 40 basis points related to the expansion of our supply chain network, 30 basis points of pressure from shrink and 35 basis points of pressure from our private label credit portfolio. \n Adjusted SG&A of 20.9% of sales levered 131 basis points relative to Q4 2021 despite a modest decline in sales as we executed on our PPI initiatives across the company. \n Adjusted operating margin rate of 9.6% of sales levered 88 basis points as adjusted SG&A leverage was partly offset by lower gross margin rate. \n The adjusted effective tax rate was 24% below prior year levels. Inventory ended the quarter at $18.5 billion, which now solely reflects the inventory for our U.S. business as we closed on the sale of the Canadian retail business on February 3. \n Inventory is up $0.9 billion from the same quarter last year, largely driven by product inflation with units down slightly to prior year. We continue to shift our inventory mix more towards Pro categories as we invest to drive future growth. \n Now let me turn to capital allocation. In 2022, we generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating results, and we returned $16.5 billion to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. \n During the fourth quarter, we paid $643 million in dividends at $1.05 per share and repurchased 10 million shares for $2 billion. This brought the total to $14.1 billion in share repurchases for the year, ahead of our expectations for approximately $13 billion. This reflected better-than-expected operating performance and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. \n We ended the quarter at 2.44x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. And finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 30.4%, inclusive of an 800 basis point impact related to transaction cost associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business. \n Turning to our 2023 financial outlook, which we introduced this morning. As Marvin indicated, the long-term outlook for home improvement remains strong. However, in 2023, residential investment will be under some pressure. Given elevated levels of inflation, higher interest rates and a more cautious consumer, we are forecasting a slight decline in the home improvement market. \n We expect to continue to outperform the market in 2023 with sales ranging from $88 billion to $90 billion. Comparable sales are expected to be in a range of flat to down 2%. Keep in mind that 2023 comparable sales will be calculated based on weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2022. \n Pro sales growth is expected to exceed DIY again in 2023 as we expect to continue to outpace the broader Pro market growth by 2x. We will continue to build on our momentum with the Pro with our new MVPs Pro Loyalty Program, CRM tools, and our expanded Pro brand lineup. We are expecting operating margin in the range of 13.6% to 13.8% as we continue to drive productivity through our PPI initiatives across the organization in part to offset our planned wage investments. \n For 2023, we are expecting to invest $350 million in incremental wages for our frontline associates, which includes the 2023 portion of the $170 million permanent wage investment that went into effect in December. \n We expect capital expenditures of up to $2 billion this year and with our planned share repurchases -- we also expect to reach our 2.75x leverage target in 2023, while maintaining our BBB+ credit rating. Our strong operating performance and shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy is expected to deliver approximately $13.60 to $14 in earnings per share for the year. \n Keep in mind that there was an approximate $0.25 contribution to adjusted EPS from the 53rd week in our Canadian business in 2022. I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations for first half performance, which is an easier comparison from a sales perspective. \n However, when we consider the impact of lower lumber prices, we are expecting a nearly 300 basis point headwind to sales in the first quarter and a 100 basis point headwind to sales in the second quarter. Given these impacts, we expect our first quarter sales comps to be below our full year guidance range and our second quarter sales comps to be above our full year guidance range. \n In closing, I'm confident that the combination of our strong operating results and our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategies will continue to deliver meaningful, long-term shareholder value. \n And with that, we will open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\n And our first question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: First, I have a macro and then a micro question. So you just comped -- roughly minus -- minus 1 in the U.S. with some rounding and the midpoint of the guide is minus 1. I know the monthlies -- when Brandon gave the monthlies that kind of answered it. \n But ignoring comparisons, I guess the guidance assumes that largely the backdrop holds up. And I wanted to re-question that, given some of the deceleration in some of the housing metrics. So -- and what drives that? \nMarvin Ellison: I'll take the first part, Simeon. I'll kind of go back to what I said in some of the prepared comments. When we take a look at what our demand drivers are for home improvement -- and just to be specific, these are historical demand drivers that have held up over time. They still remain supportive. \n And things like disposable personal income, which I mentioned, is roughly $1.5 trillion in savings above pre-pandemic levels. The average equity in U.S. homes, roughly $330,000 on average, the age of homes, and a reminder, 2/3 of everything we sell is nondiscretionary. And there are other tailwinds, millennial household, formation trend, baby boomers, aging in place, and more widespread, sustainable remote work. So all of these things give us some confidence that the backdrop remains supportive. \n But as Brandon said, we still have some degree of caution when we think about discretionary buying, and that is factored into the guide. \n So I'll let Brandon add anything additional to that. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Simeon, this is Brandon. I'll talk to your question specifically on Q4. As I said in the prepared remarks, inflation, interest rates, we are seeing a bit more of a cautious consumer, one that's anticipating and responding to value. \n We saw this play out in November with discretionary holiday categories, but we did see a nice progression of performance across the quarter as we hit the January exit. And we continue to see solid DIY demand in core home improvement categories like appliances. \n So as we turn and look at the guide in the next year, we feel comfortable with what we're seeing in Q4, very much in line with what we shared back in December in terms of the moderate scenario. And it's consistent with the market being down, call it, low single digits 2% to 3%. So I think we got a lot of good consistency with what we're seeing again in Q4 with what we're anticipating for the full year next year. \nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And the follow-up is more micro. Within this, the long-term guidance that you gave in December, the 14.5% to 15%, there's about $150 million to $200 million or so from OpEx productivity and then I think the -- some of the PPI initiatives. And I guess that's the stuff you can control. \n I forget, if we discussed, if that's ratable. Meaning even across the time frame or are there things that you can pull forward this year or any year, if you need it? And/or is the cost environment going up such that it makes the achievement of that bucket any different? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Simeon, I would say ratable as we look at the 3-year period with what we shared in December. I mean, when we look at the algorithm for the guide for '23, we are expecting roughly flat gross margin. So the bulk of the 60 to 80 basis points of EBIT expansion that's reflected in the guide is coming from SG&A leverage, and it's being largely driven by our productivity initiatives. \n So that's specifically just translating and transitioning from what we shared on the 3-year to what we're expecting from an SG&A standpoint in '23. \nMarvin Ellison: And Simeon, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add is, if you take a look at Q4, just as an example, it just -- it shows that even in a flat to negative sales environment, we still have the ability to leverage productivity, whether that's expenses or operating margin. And I think that is consistent with the PPI initiatives not being solely focused in one functional area, but as you heard at our December Analyst and Investor Conference, it's across all functions, merchandising, supply chains, to operations. \n And so although it's ratable, we're very confident in our ability to deliver upon that in a variety of macro scenarios. \nOperator: Next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nPatrick Hollander: This is Patrick Hollander on for Kate. We just wanted to ask about price elasticity. Another item discussed at the December Analyst Day was kind of the confidence in prices sticking but your competitor mentioned that they saw more price sensitivity in the fourth quarter than they had in the third quarter. \n So first, are you guys seeing something similar? And then how do you address some of the price sensitivity, do prices need to come down? Will we see more markdown activity? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Patrick, this is Brandon. As it relates to the question on elasticity, stepping back, we look at the last 3 years through the pandemic, we saw consumers who were very resilient with higher prices, not necessarily impacting demand that we were seeing for our business. \n As I mentioned in the last response, we are seeing more normal consumer trends with consumers anticipating and responding to value. So as we look at '23, we are expecting a modest inflation lift across the portfolio. Most of that is going to be wrap of inflation that we're seeing in 2022 lapping into 2023. \n We're expecting that inflation to continue to slow, and we're seeing minimal activity in terms of new pipeline requests coming in from our supplier base. And that inflation is going to impact mostly first half as those benefits are expected to normalize as we move through the year, next year. \n And then on the transaction side, we expect that inflation to be offset by a modest decline in transactions, which we also expect to see that improve across the year. So we're looking back half of the year and then into 2024 a more traditional balance between ticket and transaction. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Joe on for Scott. I was really impressed by the Pro commentary. I was just wondering, is there any sort of regional thing that you'd break out whether or not people are more or less bullish on their outlooks and backlogs in areas where there's been more housing price correction? \nMarvin Ellison: So Joe, good question. What I'll tell you, there are a couple of markets around the country that had a more accelerated, what I would call, appreciation of home prices during the pandemic. And let's call out markets like South Florida, Phoenix, as an example. \n And as you can imagine, we pay really close attention to those markets. We've not seen any material difference in sales performance in those markets as those prices tend to come -- are coming down than in the broader U.S. \n And so when I cited the statistic that 70% of our Pros in our survey from January are very confident in their backlog being consistent to last year and being able to sustain it, that is pretty much a universal statement across all geographies. \n What I can tell you is that we're very pleased with the performance of our MVP Loyalty Program and how it's sustaining and giving us the ability to drive sales. And I'll let Joe just touch a little bit on that program and how we think that's going to allow us to build loyalty and continue to grow this very important business. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And Joe, thanks for the question. As it relates to the Pro and the market, Marvin made his prepared comments. But as you dig deeper, there's kind of 5 key areas that we look at, which is the jobs how far out the Pro is booked in the next 6 months. Materials, can they get what they need and is it the right cost? Can they get to Pro Credit? What does the labor market look like? And then just the balance of the type of work they do. \n So remodel versus new construction. And as we track these and as we roll out our Pro loyalty program, we're pleased with the trajectory of the business and the health of this small Pro that we're servicing. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: I apologize. My question may sound like similar prior questions. Going back to the comments made by your competitor last week, they discussed what -- they termed kind of broadening, if you will, of consumer normalization, consumer weakness. \n You called out weakness around the holiday, the gift giving, discretionary. But are you -- would you characterize also seeing that, what they discussed in this kind of this broadening, a weakness in normalization across your portfolio? \nMarvin Ellison: Brian, it's a fair question. And I'd start off by saying Q4 is typically our highest discretionary selling period of the year because of the holiday season. But when we look at core home improvement categories, we feel really good about the performance of the DIY customer. \n And I think as Brandon gave that monthly comp cadence for the fourth quarter, you notice that every month, the business performed stronger with a positive comp in January, and that was almost directly correlated to the DIY customer being stronger each month of the quarter because we moved away from that discretionary period that was so heavily focused on the month of November because of holiday buy. \n So as we look at the overall customer, we look at the health of the DIY discretionary spending. We don't see any really red flags that we're concerned about because the core home improvement discretionary categories held up really well for us, case in point, appliances, case in point, paint. So those are areas that really performed well. And I'll let Brandon add any additional comments. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Brian, I'll just connect that to the guide, Marvin highlighted with what we're seeing more with the DIY customer. But just looking at the Pro and expectations into '23, continuing to outpace DIY 11 quarters in a row, double-digit comp, we're continuing to see Pro across all ticket ranges, both comp and transaction growth. \n And while we did see DIY lag in 2022 in the discretionary category, some of what Marvin was describing, we are seeing those overall transactions continue to improve across the year. So when we look at '23, still expecting outperformance with the Pro but expecting that gap between Pro and DIY to continue to close and tighten, and that's what's reflected in our guide for next year. \nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. And then my follow-up question, just with regard to lumber prices. So you discussed here -- and we get it, this is kind of a pass-along dynamic when prices declined as a negative for sales. \n But if we've gotten to the point where lumber prices have declined so much of -- that's actually becoming a potential stimulant to demand, I don't know if you're seeing this in your business or maybe in some of pooling of your professional customers? \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Brian, I'll take that and, again, kind of connect it to the guide. So our guide at the midpoint for lumber, in particular, assumes a normalized pricing environment, certainly considered to what we've seen for the last [ 30 ] years. \n And within that lumber assumption, as you heard in my prepared remarks, expecting headwind in both Q1 and Q2. And I'll call out also if that -- when we look at lumber pricing currently, if that were to play out across the remainder of the year, it actually puts another 100 basis points of pressure on the midpoint of the guide. \n But to your point, within that, we are expecting an offset in units, and there's potential that, that could be a stimulant for our business. But again, right now, we're expecting and have considered at the midpoint of our guide, just more normalized pricing and a slight rebound in units in the next year. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. \nKaren Short: So just on 2 questions. You guided to flat to down 2% comps. So that was kind of in between the robust and moderate scenarios that you offered. And then your margins, though, are only on the moderate range, not the robust range. So I'm wondering if you could give any color on that.\n  And then on the wage investments that you called out. Obviously, one of your competitors also announced very sizable wage investments. So wondering if you could just give a little color on your wage investment versus industry and/or one of your largest competitors. \nMarvin Ellison: So Karen, this is Marvin. I'll take the wage question, then I'll let Brandon take the first part of the question. \n So 2 things. First, we feel great about the financial commitment we've made to our front line associates. And we're also very confident in our long-term financial plan. So since 2018, as we mentioned, we've invested over $3 billion in incremental wages and share-based compensation for front line associates, including $170 million wage investment we made last year. \n And over the past 4 years, we've increased our wage by more than 20%. And Brandon mentioned that we're going to be investing $350 million this year in frontline wages. And over the next 3 years, we're going to invest nearly $1 billion. So when you contemplate all this together, it's factored in our 2023 guidance and our long-term financial guidance. \n And as an investor community, sometimes we get challenged by our rural footprint of stores as a competitive disadvantage. When you discuss wage, it's actually an advantage because most of the small and rural markets where we operate, we're the highest paying retailer. And where we're not, the local operators have a very, very specific process to follow to get wage adjusted. \n So our approach to wage is our strategy, and we feel really good about it, and our associates have responded well. And what I'll do before I hand it to Brandon, I'm just going to let Joe McFarland talk a little bit about staffing levels and spring hiring, which, as you know, is a really big deal for us this time of the year. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Karen, thanks for the question. And as it relates to our frontline associates, I'm very pleased with our staffing right now. This is the best staffing we've had in 3 years. And our spring hiring as the markets come into season is ahead of expectations. So very pleased with the team's ability to staff and pivot wherever the challenges are. \nMarvin Ellison: And so Karen, in summation on that, we have a strategy, we feel great about it. We feel like it's working for us, and we believe that our investment cycle, our commitment to our associates is something that is leading us to being truly an employer of choice in retail. And I'll hand it over to Brandon to answer the other part of your question. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Karen, your first question on operating margin. We look at what we shared in December, a midpoint of the guide down 1% and 13.7% in that moderate scenario. Our guidance is right in line, purely consistent with that with the range that we provided just bookending those midpoints. So very consistent there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So first, at the analyst meeting in December, you pointed to the most likely scenario being the robust market scenario or the moderate market scenario. The guidance now at the midpoint is squarely on the moderate market scenario, and at the low end could be closer to the weak market scenario. \n So what's changed in the last 90 days or so to moderate your expectations for 2023? And then I have a follow-up. \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. So Michael, this is Marvin. At a high level, it's lumber deflation. That pretty much sums it up. As Brandon mentioned, we're going to have 300 basis points of headwind in Q1 and 100 basis points of headwind in Q2. \n Going into 2023, we looked at the first half of the year as our easiest compares. That remains. But when you throw in that lumber deflation, that pretty much sums up what's different between what we discussed in December and what our guidance is. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. And Michael, I'll just add that the weak scenario that we called out still very much sort of off the table for us. I think we called out at that point, it would require significant economic shock, and we don't see that playing out. \n So we're still very squarely in line with that moderate view. And just as a reminder, the downside, even in that weak scenario was a 13.3% operating margin, so still 30 basis points of expansion even in that scenario. \nMichael Lasser: Understood. My follow-up is on the gross margin outlook for this year. What's a realistic expectation, especially as the consumer environment gets a little tougher, the consumer may shop or want to shop a bit more on promotion. And how are you thinking about the private label credit card contribution to the overall P&L this year? \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Michael, I'll talk about the guide as it relates to margins. So very focused next year on delivering operating margin expansion, and that's on flat to slightly negative comps. \n As you mentioned, the gross margin we are expecting that to be roughly flat in '23. And there's a few different puts and takes that we're managing on the headwind side, continued rollout and expansion of our supply chain, specifically market delivery. We're going to continue to see mix pressure from our Pro strategic initiative investments. \n The flip side a number of productivity efforts. You mentioned private brand penetration, also lower commodity and transportation costs and then continued benefit from our pricing initiatives. So the large part of the leverage is going to come from SG&A and continued PPI productivity efforts that you've heard called out from the team. \n So that's sort of the formula as we look at margins and flow through next year. And Bill, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add on private brands and some of the momentum that we're seeing there? \nWilliam Boltz: Well, Brandon, and for Michael, what we talked about in December, private brands certainly gives us an opportunity in categories where a national brand isn't relevant. Private brands carry a better margin. They offer the consumer some additional choices.\n As it relates to promotional activity, we want to continue to offer the customers value, but we're not adding new promotions for 2023. \nMichael Lasser: That's helpful. And just to clarify, referring to the private label credit card, that was a drag on the gross margin in the fourth quarter. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Got it, Michael. So -- yes, drag in Q4 mainly given the interest rate environment that we're seeing. But as we turn into 2023, again, a number of puts and takes, but we feel like the bulk of that for the most part has been absorbed, and we have that factored into '23. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. \nGregory Melich: I'll start with a follow-up on that last question before I get to mine. On other gross margin puts and takes, shrink was also I think a headwind in the fourth quarter. Could you just quantify that and give us your expectations for that into '23? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. So sure, Greg. On shrink, in particular, it was a bit of a pressure point, a bit worse than expected. It's been approximately 30 basis point pressure. We saw that Q3 and Q4, largely driven by what we're seeing more broadly in retail with organized crime. \n But again, as we turn and look at '23, that pressure largely absorbed in 2022. We feel like we got great efforts within the team and the organization in terms of what we're doing to protect against shrink, and I'll maybe let Joe call that out. \nJoseph McFarland: So thanks for the question. And listen, we're really pleased with the asset protection team. The entire industry has pressure from ORC. Our asset protection team has rolled out some new, innovative things for safety, for shrink, and so we see the outlook good. \nGregory Melich: Great. And then I guess, my key question was on the traffic and inflation and how that sort of comes in through the year. So if you think about the cadence through the year, it sounds like first quarter is below the range, second quarter is above the range. Should we assume the second half is better than the first half or worse than the first half or in line? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Second half, Greg, very much in line. \nGregory Melich: Got it. And the difference would be better traffic in the second half, maybe still negative but less negative? And less... \nBrandon Sink: Correct. Correct. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: Just wanted to -- on the first quarter comp view that you laid out there. We understand the commodity impacts there. But just curious, any early season read? I know it is early, but some of your markets in the South, just curious how Spring seasonal demand is starting out here? That's my first question. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Peter, as we look at February sales consistent with our guidance, we called out the Q1 being below the full year guidance range. And again, that's primarily due to the lumber pricing pressure that we're seeing. We are encouraged to see early signs of strength in discretionary seasonal categories, in particular, South and deep South as our customers begin to prepare for spring, and I'll let Bill talk to that in a little bit more detail. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Thanks, Brandon. And Peter, we started setting our stores in the South, Deep South, early January. And I think what's nice to see is spring start to come in the way it's supposed to come. And you start to see sales of product in fertilizer, chemicals, landscape products start to occur the way they're supposed to occur. And so we're encouraged by that. February can always be a wildcard month. But certainly, in these months -- in these Deep south and South markets seeing it kind of progress the way it's supposed to. \nPeter Benedict: Got it. And then just back to the -- maybe the promotional plan that you have laid out for the year. I mean, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the consumer is responding to value. \n I'm just curious -- I mean, we've been through a period where there's been very limited promotion. So how do we think about the plan maybe for the first half of the year here in terms of your promotions? Things that you tend to do to drive traffic, how they compare to maybe what you've done in the last couple of years? That's my second question. \nMarvin Ellison: So Peter, I'll take the first part of that. At the highest level, you're not going to see any increased promotional activities by us. We're very fortunate to be in a very rational industry relative to promotions. And to be quite candid, a lot of the irrational activities came from old Lowe's. \n And those practices and behaviors are along behind. Those are one of the first things that Bill Boltz and I discussed when we arrived 4.5 years ago was getting off the high-low promotional drug that we felt was not consistent with how you should run business in this industry. And it's taken us a while to get there, but we're very fortunate that we are there. \n So we anticipate and see no increased promotional activities. Obviously, as you get out of these pandemic-driven demand cycles, customers are looking for value, but we believe we can offer value without getting to a high promotional environment. Bill, I don't know if there's anything you want to add? \nWilliam Boltz: No. I think the one area that the team may see different activity on is in appliances, and you guys have to remember that roughly 100,000 appliances break every day. And so there's always going to be an offer in the marketplace for appliances driven by the manufacturers, supported by the retailers. \n So that's one area supply has improved. Those offers are out there for appliance products. But no additional promotions. \nOperator: We have time for 1 final question, which will come from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim. \nSteven Forbes: Marvin, Brandon, I just wanted to follow up with a quick modeling question given the exit of Canada. And so I'm not sure if you could help us think about the mix impact on gross margin because I would think the Canadian business and the exit of it has a positive impact on gross. \n And can you help us quantify that relative to 60 basis point net impact and whether this is partially sort of supportive of the 2023 outlook for a flattish gross margin '23? \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Steve, 60 basis points was a full year impact on operating margin. And when you think about the split there between gross margin and SG&A, it's roughly half and half. \nSteven Forbes: And then lastly, the ongoing compensation related investments that you noted during the prepared remarks, which is great to hear. I was curious, if we just take a step back and think about the dollar level of OpEx productivity initiatives you've highlighted at the Analyst Days in 2020 and 2022. Any contextualization about how much still remains in front of us in dollar terms? \n And Marvin, I'm not sure, if you maybe talk about some specific PPI initiatives that you're most excited about this year? \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. Well, it's a really good question, Steve. A couple of things. Number one, as you can imagine, we have been working aggressively to update our IT infrastructure. \n We still have a 30-year-old basically mainline system that we're getting ready to retire, and it's literally taken us 4.5 years to get to this point. The moment that system is officially retired, it gives us the ability to create so many technology advancements that will do 2 things, will simplify the associate's job and limit friction points for customers, which will reduce payroll and improve customer service. And that's what Joe cited in some of his prepared comments. \n And so holistically, a lot of our PPI initiatives on the store and merchandising side, and candidly, the supply chain side are tied and correlates to the retirement of this 30-year-old operating system that we are excited is going to be going away over the next few months. \n And as we look at that, you'll start to see more omnichannel type of systems available in the store. At point of sale, you'll start to see pricing initiatives and pricing systems advanced on the merchandising side. \n You'll start to see us have the ability to do more relative to integrating gig network deliveries online in a more seamless way in addition to all the supply chain and some of the advanced sourcing logic we'll be able to do that, will give us the ability to ship merchandise, aggregate merchandise, from different points of stores, distribution centers without having to go out and build these monolithic DCs that some retailers have had to do. \n So all of those things are tied together. But again, it's almost foundationally driven to a lot of the IT work that's been done the last 4-plus years. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Lowe's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brandon Sink",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our Q4 results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 compared to $1.78 last year. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. \n Excluding the $441 million of pretax transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business, we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.28, an increase of 28% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. This increase was driven by our continued focus on productivity as well as disciplined capital allocation. Q4 sales were $22.4 billion, which includes approximately $1.4 billion in sales generated in the 14th week. Comparable sales declined 1.5%. \n U.S. comp sales were down 0.7% in the quarter with comp average ticket up 4.8% driven by product inflation and higher Pro sales partly offset by 75 basis points of lumber deflation. This was offset by a comp transaction decline of 5.5%. \n Sales in Canada totaled $958 million, a decline of 18% in USD on a comparable basis, partly driven by exchange rate unfavorability due to a stronger dollar and lumber deflation. \n FX represented a 25 basis point headwind to consolidated comps. Of note, both the Canadian sales decline and lumber deflation pressured our Q4 comps more than expected. U.S. Pro sales were up 10% in the quarter despite lumber and copper deflation. \n On Lowes.com, sales increased 5% in the quarter, partly driven by continued strength in appliance. Our U.S. monthly comps improved as we moved through the quarter, with comps down 3.1% in November due to DIY pullback on discretionary holiday spending. In December, comps were down 0.2%, with comps turning positive in January, up 1.4%, reflecting continued DIY investment in the home. \n Gross margin was 32.3% of sales in the fourth quarter, down 60 basis points from last year. Product margin rate improved 15 basis points versus the prior year. Gross margins also benefited from 30 basis points of favorable product mix due to a lower percentage of lumber sales. \n Higher product margin rate was offset by 40 basis points related to the expansion of our supply chain network, 30 basis points of pressure from shrink and 35 basis points of pressure from our private label credit portfolio. \n Adjusted SG&A of 20.9% of sales levered 131 basis points relative to Q4 2021 despite a modest decline in sales as we executed on our PPI initiatives across the company. \n Adjusted operating margin rate of 9.6% of sales levered 88 basis points as adjusted SG&A leverage was partly offset by lower gross margin rate. \n The adjusted effective tax rate was 24% below prior year levels. Inventory ended the quarter at $18.5 billion, which now solely reflects the inventory for our U.S. business as we closed on the sale of the Canadian retail business on February 3. \n Inventory is up $0.9 billion from the same quarter last year, largely driven by product inflation with units down slightly to prior year. We continue to shift our inventory mix more towards Pro categories as we invest to drive future growth. \n Now let me turn to capital allocation. In 2022, we generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow driven by outstanding operating results, and we returned $16.5 billion to our shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. \n During the fourth quarter, we paid $643 million in dividends at $1.05 per share and repurchased 10 million shares for $2 billion. This brought the total to $14.1 billion in share repurchases for the year, ahead of our expectations for approximately $13 billion. This reflected better-than-expected operating performance and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. \n We ended the quarter at 2.44x adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. And finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 30.4%, inclusive of an 800 basis point impact related to transaction cost associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business. \n Turning to our 2023 financial outlook, which we introduced this morning. As Marvin indicated, the long-term outlook for home improvement remains strong. However, in 2023, residential investment will be under some pressure. Given elevated levels of inflation, higher interest rates and a more cautious consumer, we are forecasting a slight decline in the home improvement market. \n We expect to continue to outperform the market in 2023 with sales ranging from $88 billion to $90 billion. Comparable sales are expected to be in a range of flat to down 2%. Keep in mind that 2023 comparable sales will be calculated based on weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2022. \n Pro sales growth is expected to exceed DIY again in 2023 as we expect to continue to outpace the broader Pro market growth by 2x. We will continue to build on our momentum with the Pro with our new MVPs Pro Loyalty Program, CRM tools, and our expanded Pro brand lineup. We are expecting operating margin in the range of 13.6% to 13.8% as we continue to drive productivity through our PPI initiatives across the organization in part to offset our planned wage investments. \n For 2023, we are expecting to invest $350 million in incremental wages for our frontline associates, which includes the 2023 portion of the $170 million permanent wage investment that went into effect in December. \n We expect capital expenditures of up to $2 billion this year and with our planned share repurchases -- we also expect to reach our 2.75x leverage target in 2023, while maintaining our BBB+ credit rating. Our strong operating performance and shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy is expected to deliver approximately $13.60 to $14 in earnings per share for the year. \n Keep in mind that there was an approximate $0.25 contribution to adjusted EPS from the 53rd week in our Canadian business in 2022. I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations for first half performance, which is an easier comparison from a sales perspective. \n However, when we consider the impact of lower lumber prices, we are expecting a nearly 300 basis point headwind to sales in the first quarter and a 100 basis point headwind to sales in the second quarter. Given these impacts, we expect our first quarter sales comps to be below our full year guidance range and our second quarter sales comps to be above our full year guidance range. \n In closing, I'm confident that the combination of our strong operating results and our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategies will continue to deliver meaningful, long-term shareholder value. \n And with that, we will open it up for questions. Yes, Simeon, this is Brandon. I'll talk to your question specifically on Q4. As I said in the prepared remarks, inflation, interest rates, we are seeing a bit more of a cautious consumer, one that's anticipating and responding to value. \n We saw this play out in November with discretionary holiday categories, but we did see a nice progression of performance across the quarter as we hit the January exit. And we continue to see solid DIY demand in core home improvement categories like appliances. \n So as we turn and look at the guide in the next year, we feel comfortable with what we're seeing in Q4, very much in line with what we shared back in December in terms of the moderate scenario. And it's consistent with the market being down, call it, low single digits 2% to 3%. So I think we got a lot of good consistency with what we're seeing again in Q4 with what we're anticipating for the full year next year. Yes. Simeon, I would say ratable as we look at the 3-year period with what we shared in December. I mean, when we look at the algorithm for the guide for '23, we are expecting roughly flat gross margin. So the bulk of the 60 to 80 basis points of EBIT expansion that's reflected in the guide is coming from SG&A leverage, and it's being largely driven by our productivity initiatives. \n So that's specifically just translating and transitioning from what we shared on the 3-year to what we're expecting from an SG&A standpoint in '23. Yes. Patrick, this is Brandon. As it relates to the question on elasticity, stepping back, we look at the last 3 years through the pandemic, we saw consumers who were very resilient with higher prices, not necessarily impacting demand that we were seeing for our business. \n As I mentioned in the last response, we are seeing more normal consumer trends with consumers anticipating and responding to value. So as we look at '23, we are expecting a modest inflation lift across the portfolio. Most of that is going to be wrap of inflation that we're seeing in 2022 lapping into 2023. \n We're expecting that inflation to continue to slow, and we're seeing minimal activity in terms of new pipeline requests coming in from our supplier base. And that inflation is going to impact mostly first half as those benefits are expected to normalize as we move through the year, next year. \n And then on the transaction side, we expect that inflation to be offset by a modest decline in transactions, which we also expect to see that improve across the year. So we're looking back half of the year and then into 2024 a more traditional balance between ticket and transaction. Yes. Brian, I'll just connect that to the guide, Marvin highlighted with what we're seeing more with the DIY customer. But just looking at the Pro and expectations into '23, continuing to outpace DIY 11 quarters in a row, double-digit comp, we're continuing to see Pro across all ticket ranges, both comp and transaction growth. \n And while we did see DIY lag in 2022 in the discretionary category, some of what Marvin was describing, we are seeing those overall transactions continue to improve across the year. So when we look at '23, still expecting outperformance with the Pro but expecting that gap between Pro and DIY to continue to close and tighten, and that's what's reflected in our guide for next year. Yes, Brian, I'll take that and, again, kind of connect it to the guide. So our guide at the midpoint for lumber, in particular, assumes a normalized pricing environment, certainly considered to what we've seen for the last [ 30 ] years. \n And within that lumber assumption, as you heard in my prepared remarks, expecting headwind in both Q1 and Q2. And I'll call out also if that -- when we look at lumber pricing currently, if that were to play out across the remainder of the year, it actually puts another 100 basis points of pressure on the midpoint of the guide. \n But to your point, within that, we are expecting an offset in units, and there's potential that, that could be a stimulant for our business. But again, right now, we're expecting and have considered at the midpoint of our guide, just more normalized pricing and a slight rebound in units in the next year. Yes. Karen, your first question on operating margin. We look at what we shared in December, a midpoint of the guide down 1% and 13.7% in that moderate scenario. Our guidance is right in line, purely consistent with that with the range that we provided just bookending those midpoints. So very consistent there. Yes. And Michael, I'll just add that the weak scenario that we called out still very much sort of off the table for us. I think we called out at that point, it would require significant economic shock, and we don't see that playing out. \n So we're still very squarely in line with that moderate view. And just as a reminder, the downside, even in that weak scenario was a 13.3% operating margin, so still 30 basis points of expansion even in that scenario. Yes, Michael, I'll talk about the guide as it relates to margins. So very focused next year on delivering operating margin expansion, and that's on flat to slightly negative comps. \n As you mentioned, the gross margin we are expecting that to be roughly flat in '23. And there's a few different puts and takes that we're managing on the headwind side, continued rollout and expansion of our supply chain, specifically market delivery. We're going to continue to see mix pressure from our Pro strategic initiative investments. \n The flip side a number of productivity efforts. You mentioned private brand penetration, also lower commodity and transportation costs and then continued benefit from our pricing initiatives. So the large part of the leverage is going to come from SG&A and continued PPI productivity efforts that you've heard called out from the team. \n So that's sort of the formula as we look at margins and flow through next year. And Bill, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add on private brands and some of the momentum that we're seeing there? Yes. Got it, Michael. So -- yes, drag in Q4 mainly given the interest rate environment that we're seeing. But as we turn into 2023, again, a number of puts and takes, but we feel like the bulk of that for the most part has been absorbed, and we have that factored into '23. Yes. So sure, Greg. On shrink, in particular, it was a bit of a pressure point, a bit worse than expected. It's been approximately 30 basis point pressure. We saw that Q3 and Q4, largely driven by what we're seeing more broadly in retail with organized crime. \n But again, as we turn and look at '23, that pressure largely absorbed in 2022. We feel like we got great efforts within the team and the organization in terms of what we're doing to protect against shrink, and I'll maybe let Joe call that out. Yes. Second half, Greg, very much in line. Correct. Correct. Yes. Peter, as we look at February sales consistent with our guidance, we called out the Q1 being below the full year guidance range. And again, that's primarily due to the lumber pricing pressure that we're seeing. We are encouraged to see early signs of strength in discretionary seasonal categories, in particular, South and deep South as our customers begin to prepare for spring, and I'll let Bill talk to that in a little bit more detail. Yes, Steve, 60 basis points was a full year impact on operating margin. And when you think about the split there between gross margin and SG&A, it's roughly half and half."

            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, our total company comparable sales declined 1.5%, while U.S. comps decreased 0.7%. \n For the quarter, commodity deflation impacted U.S. comps by 75 basis points. Our investments in the Pro customers continue to pay dividends for the company reflected by our continued strong Pro sales in the fourth quarter. In fact, this is the 11th consecutive quarter that we've driven double-digit Pro growth in the U.S. despite stronger-than-expected commodity deflation. \n And while there was continued solid DIY demand in core home improvement categories, as expected, we saw a DIY pullback on holiday gift buying. Despite a modest decrease in sales, we once again improved our adjusted operating margin by maintaining our disciplined focus on productivity. \n During the quarter, adjusted operating margin expanded approximately 88 basis points leading to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.28, a 28% increase compared to last year. These results cap off solid financial performance for fiscal 2022 with sales of $97.1 billion, adjusted operating margin of 13%, and adjusted earnings per share of $13.81\t up 15% over the prior year. \n With these results, we're awarding $220 million in discretionary and profit-sharing bonuses to our associates, which includes an incremental $70 million for our assistant store managers and supply chain supervisors who hold 2 of the most critical frontline leadership roles in the company. This builds on our recent $170 million investment in permanent wage increases for our frontline, hourly associates, which went into effect in December. \n Since 2018, we've invested over $3 billion in incremental wages and share-based compensation for our frontline associates, including increasing associate wages by over 20%. And as we mentioned at our December Analyst and Investor Conference, we are committed to additional frontline wage investments over the next several years, which are contemplated in our long-term targets. These compensation investments are just one reflection of our commitment to becoming the employer of choice in retail, which Joe will discuss in more detail. \n Throughout the quarter, we continued to gain traction with our Total Home Strategy as consumers remain engaged in home-related activities. In Pro, we delivered U.S. growth of 10% and 36% on a 2-year basis. We are capitalizing on our momentum with our Pro by growing our MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program, building relationships through our CRM tool and continuing to enhance our product assortment to meet Pro needs. \n One example of enhancing our Pro product assortment is the exciting news that client tools will be coming back to Lowe's. We know that our Pros are officially loyal to certain national brands and Klein is the #1 hand tool brand among electrical and HVAC professionals. This creates immediate credibility across trades. Bill will share more detail on this exciting addition to our assortment later in the call. \n Now one question many of you have asked is about our Pro backlog and if they're still healthy. We're in constant communication with our Pros through formal surveys, our Pro counsel and countless day-to-day conversations. In our January survey, more than 70% of Pros stated that they were booked out the same or more compared to 2022, and they remain confident in their ability to find jobs and hold on to their backlog. We believe this dynamic is being fueled by all the things we talked about at our December Analyst and Investor Conference, which includes homeowners with strong balance sheets and record levels of equity. \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 5% on top of 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, partly due to strong appliance sales. This represents a 2-year comp of 17% and more than 11% sales penetration. We continue to remove friction from the customers' online experience, which includes adding Apple Pay this quarter to improve conversion. \n We're also focused on removing friction from our customers' omnichannel shopping journeys, like for appliances where customers often shop our showrooms before making their purchase online. We also continue to make strides in the rollout of our market delivery model for appliances and other big and bulky products. \n We added 2 new geographic areas this quarter, bringing us to 10 geographic regions across the country supporting more than 1,000 stores. And as a reminder, in the market-based delivery model, big and bulky products flow from our supply chain directly to customers' homes replacing our inefficient store delivery model. This delivery model is enabling us to further consolidate our industry leadership position in appliances and it positions us for profitable growth and other big and bulky product categories like grills, riding lawnmowers and stock cabinets. \n Turning to Canada. We completed the sale of our Canadian retail business to Sycamore Partners this quarter. As a result, we are now solely focused on the transformation of our U.S. business, where we estimate we have a $1 trillion addressable home improvement market, enabling us to invest more into higher-return opportunities to grow our business and to take market share. I'd like to extend my appreciation to the entire Canadian team for their commitment to serving our customers, and I wish them the best as they move forward under new ownership. \n Before I close, I'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market. And as you know, there is a wide range of conflicting opinions on what's going to happen in the macro environment in 2023. From our perspective, the core drivers of our business, disposable personal income, home price appreciation, and the age of housing stock, remain supportive. Consumer savings are still roughly $1.5 trillion higher than pre-pandemic with 85% concentrated in the top 40% of income earners who are more likely to be homeowners. Homeowners continue to enjoy record levels of equity in their homes, nearly $330,000 on average. Even if there is a modest decline in home prices, the level of equity built up during the pandemic would not be meaningfully eroded. And the housing stock continues to age with 50% of U.S. homes over 41 years old, the oldest since World War II. \n These factors, along with strong millennial household formation, baby boomers' increasing preference to age in place and more widespread remote work will continue to be tailwinds for our business. \n And given the slowdown in housing turnover is driven by higher rates and low supply rather than demand, we continue to see a nationwide trend of trading up in place with consumers opting to upgrade their existing home to meet their evolving needs. All of these dynamics give us confidence in the medium- and longer-term outlook for the industry. \n That being said, we also know that consumers are weary of a potential recession, which is reflected in some of the discretionary pullback we experienced during the holiday season. We're closely monitoring trends and we have a proven playbook to pivot quickly if the macro softens. \n Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrate our operational agility, which is reflected in our ability to leverage expenses and deliver productivity in a negative comp sales environment. This gives our experienced leadership team confidence in our ability to effectively manage the business in a wide variety of macro scenario. \n In closing, I'd like to thank our frontline associates for their commitment to serving customers day in and day out. As I travel to country every week visiting stores, I continue to be impressed by their passion for helping customers and their communities. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. I'll take the first part, Simeon. I'll kind of go back to what I said in some of the prepared comments. When we take a look at what our demand drivers are for home improvement -- and just to be specific, these are historical demand drivers that have held up over time. They still remain supportive. \n And things like disposable personal income, which I mentioned, is roughly $1.5 trillion in savings above pre-pandemic levels. The average equity in U.S. homes, roughly $330,000 on average, the age of homes, and a reminder, 2/3 of everything we sell is nondiscretionary. And there are other tailwinds, millennial household, formation trend, baby boomers, aging in place, and more widespread, sustainable remote work. So all of these things give us some confidence that the backdrop remains supportive. \n But as Brandon said, we still have some degree of caution when we think about discretionary buying, and that is factored into the guide. \n So I'll let Brandon add anything additional to that. And Simeon, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add is, if you take a look at Q4, just as an example, it just -- it shows that even in a flat to negative sales environment, we still have the ability to leverage productivity, whether that's expenses or operating margin. And I think that is consistent with the PPI initiatives not being solely focused in one functional area, but as you heard at our December Analyst and Investor Conference, it's across all functions, merchandising, supply chains, to operations. \n And so although it's ratable, we're very confident in our ability to deliver upon that in a variety of macro scenarios. So Joe, good question. What I'll tell you, there are a couple of markets around the country that had a more accelerated, what I would call, appreciation of home prices during the pandemic. And let's call out markets like South Florida, Phoenix, as an example. \n And as you can imagine, we pay really close attention to those markets. We've not seen any material difference in sales performance in those markets as those prices tend to come -- are coming down than in the broader U.S. \n And so when I cited the statistic that 70% of our Pros in our survey from January are very confident in their backlog being consistent to last year and being able to sustain it, that is pretty much a universal statement across all geographies. \n What I can tell you is that we're very pleased with the performance of our MVP Loyalty Program and how it's sustaining and giving us the ability to drive sales. And I'll let Joe just touch a little bit on that program and how we think that's going to allow us to build loyalty and continue to grow this very important business. Brian, it's a fair question. And I'd start off by saying Q4 is typically our highest discretionary selling period of the year because of the holiday season. But when we look at core home improvement categories, we feel really good about the performance of the DIY customer. \n And I think as Brandon gave that monthly comp cadence for the fourth quarter, you notice that every month, the business performed stronger with a positive comp in January, and that was almost directly correlated to the DIY customer being stronger each month of the quarter because we moved away from that discretionary period that was so heavily focused on the month of November because of holiday buy. \n So as we look at the overall customer, we look at the health of the DIY discretionary spending. We don't see any really red flags that we're concerned about because the core home improvement discretionary categories held up really well for us, case in point, appliances, case in point, paint. So those are areas that really performed well. And I'll let Brandon add any additional comments. So Karen, this is Marvin. I'll take the wage question, then I'll let Brandon take the first part of the question. \n So 2 things. First, we feel great about the financial commitment we've made to our front line associates. And we're also very confident in our long-term financial plan. So since 2018, as we mentioned, we've invested over $3 billion in incremental wages and share-based compensation for front line associates, including $170 million wage investment we made last year. \n And over the past 4 years, we've increased our wage by more than 20%. And Brandon mentioned that we're going to be investing $350 million this year in frontline wages. And over the next 3 years, we're going to invest nearly $1 billion. So when you contemplate all this together, it's factored in our 2023 guidance and our long-term financial guidance. \n And as an investor community, sometimes we get challenged by our rural footprint of stores as a competitive disadvantage. When you discuss wage, it's actually an advantage because most of the small and rural markets where we operate, we're the highest paying retailer. And where we're not, the local operators have a very, very specific process to follow to get wage adjusted. \n So our approach to wage is our strategy, and we feel really good about it, and our associates have responded well. And what I'll do before I hand it to Brandon, I'm just going to let Joe McFarland talk a little bit about staffing levels and spring hiring, which, as you know, is a really big deal for us this time of the year. And so Karen, in summation on that, we have a strategy, we feel great about it. We feel like it's working for us, and we believe that our investment cycle, our commitment to our associates is something that is leading us to being truly an employer of choice in retail. And I'll hand it over to Brandon to answer the other part of your question. Yes. So Michael, this is Marvin. At a high level, it's lumber deflation. That pretty much sums it up. As Brandon mentioned, we're going to have 300 basis points of headwind in Q1 and 100 basis points of headwind in Q2. \n Going into 2023, we looked at the first half of the year as our easiest compares. That remains. But when you throw in that lumber deflation, that pretty much sums up what's different between what we discussed in December and what our guidance is. So Peter, I'll take the first part of that. At the highest level, you're not going to see any increased promotional activities by us. We're very fortunate to be in a very rational industry relative to promotions. And to be quite candid, a lot of the irrational activities came from old Lowe's. \n And those practices and behaviors are along behind. Those are one of the first things that Bill Boltz and I discussed when we arrived 4.5 years ago was getting off the high-low promotional drug that we felt was not consistent with how you should run business in this industry. And it's taken us a while to get there, but we're very fortunate that we are there. \n So we anticipate and see no increased promotional activities. Obviously, as you get out of these pandemic-driven demand cycles, customers are looking for value, but we believe we can offer value without getting to a high promotional environment. Bill, I don't know if there's anything you want to add? Yes. Well, it's a really good question, Steve. A couple of things. Number one, as you can imagine, we have been working aggressively to update our IT infrastructure. \n We still have a 30-year-old basically mainline system that we're getting ready to retire, and it's literally taken us 4.5 years to get to this point. The moment that system is officially retired, it gives us the ability to create so many technology advancements that will do 2 things, will simplify the associate's job and limit friction points for customers, which will reduce payroll and improve customer service. And that's what Joe cited in some of his prepared comments. \n And so holistically, a lot of our PPI initiatives on the store and merchandising side, and candidly, the supply chain side are tied and correlates to the retirement of this 30-year-old operating system that we are excited is going to be going away over the next few months. \n And as we look at that, you'll start to see more omnichannel type of systems available in the store. At point of sale, you'll start to see pricing initiatives and pricing systems advanced on the merchandising side. \n You'll start to see us have the ability to do more relative to integrating gig network deliveries online in a more seamless way in addition to all the supply chain and some of the advanced sourcing logic we'll be able to do that, will give us the ability to ship merchandise, aggregate merchandise, from different points of stores, distribution centers without having to go out and build these monolithic DCs that some retailers have had to do. \n So all of those things are tied together. But again, it's almost foundationally driven to a lot of the IT work that's been done the last 4-plus years."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, U.S. comparable sales decreased slightly by 0.7%, though sales were up 34.4% on a 3-year basis, reflecting continued momentum with the Pro and resilience in core DIY home improvement demand. \n We delivered positive comps in home decor, fueled by key categories like appliances, paint, and kitchen and bath. And we delivered strong growth in our Building Products division, excluding the impacts of commodity deflation. We are particularly encouraged by the Pro strength we're seeing across categories, including rough plumbing, building materials, paint and millwork as we continue to expand our product and service offerings to meet their needs. \n And consistent with our Total Home Strategy, we continue to add brands relevant to Pros, including 4 new partnerships. First, we're adding a portfolio of drinks from Coca-Cola to reduce the number of stops Pros make before going to the job site, which is important since time is money for these customers. \n Second, we are adding Carhartt Apparel that's popular with both our Pro and our DIY consumer especially in our rural stores. \n Third, we have entered a new national partnership with Hubbell, giving us access to all of their Pro branded electrical boxes, including Bell, TayMac and RACO. And fourth, we are excited to be bringing back client tools. As Marvin mentioned, this is the #1 hand tool brand among electrical and HVAC professionals. So this is just a big deal for us and our Pros. \n We are also really excited to announce that Lowe's will offer the widest selection of client products anywhere in the home improvement retail channel, which will be available in the second half of 2023. \n Our initial selection of client tools will include hand tools and electrical test and measurement tools, followed by a multiyear rollout of new product innovations. Fine Tools, Hubble, Carhartt and Coca-Cola are strong additions to our Pro brand arsenal, which already includes other great brands like Bosch, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner. \n As we gain momentum with the Pro, we continue to see brands come to Lowe's and in many cases, come back to Lowe's because they recognize our newfound recommitment to the Pro and see the opportunity to grow with us. \n Shifting to our merchandising division performance for the quarter. In home decor, appliances, paint and kitchens and baths led the way. Appliances grew across both Pro and DIY as we continue to gain market share in this critical category. Growth was bolstered by our new instant savings capability that automatically applies supplier rebates to a customer's order, making it much easier and faster for them to take advantage of these offers, which are supported by the manufacturer. This replaces our cumbersome mail-in rebates with real-time savings, both in stores and online to remove friction for the customer and improve conversion. This innovation is another example of Lowe's leapfrogging the competition with technology that not only improves the customer experience, but also drives labor productivity. \n Paint was another standout category with solid pro-growth fueled by our MVPs Pro Paint Rewards and Pro JobSIGHT delivery. We're also seeing an uptick in paint attachments items like applicators, paint sundries and caulk as we upgrade our paint departments across our stores. This upgrade is strategically designed to make it easier for our customers to get everything they need in one trip. \n We also began the launch of STAINMASTER paint, a high-quality, high-value solution for busy families looking to protect their walls from fingerprints and other messes. This is Lowe's first-ever private brand paint and early results are already outperforming our expectations. \n Our focus on driving private brand penetration is well timed enabling us to capitalize on the nationwide trend of increasing customer preference for private brands. \n Another category that outperformed this quarter is kitchens and bath. We were particularly encouraged to see a strong increase in demand for custom cabinets driven by improved lead times as well as an expanded suite of digital tools, along with our team of talented virtual designers, all of which help our customers tailor the right solutions for their budgets and design preferences. \n Turning to the Building Products division. We delivered strong, broad-based growth, excluding the impacts of commodity deflation across copper and lumber. We delivered strong positive comps across rough plumbing, building materials and millwork driven by Pro demand and continued DIY investment in the home. \n Our performance in hard lines was consistent with broader consumer trends as we saw a decrease in holiday gift buying compared to the prior year. However, the team still delivered a solid holiday season with sell-throughs above 2019 levels. As expected, consumers reverted to more typical holiday buying patterns as compared to last year when we saw a widespread early buying due to supply chain concerns. \n As we look ahead, we continue to build on our customers' preference for new and innovative products with continued enhancements to our product assortments. We are expanding on our popular Kobalt 24-Volt platform with new tools and technology that customers have been asking for, including a cordless Kobalt nailer that can instantly fire 1,100 nails on a single charge, eliminated the need to drag an air compressor and a hose around the job site. \n We're also excited about our new EGO zero turn radius mower with the industry's first e-STEER technology. With the sleek, intuitive steering wheel that increases the driver's control and precision, powered by the EGO battery system that now allows this unit to mow 3 acres on a single charge. \n We are ready to capitalize on spring with the best in-stock positions that we've had in 3 years, right on time to support our biggest selling season of the year. In addition to an enhanced assortment and strong in-stock levels, we're also making strides in driving merchandising productivity as part of our enterprise-wide perpetual productivity improvement initiatives. \n As one of the larger importers in the U.S., we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and reduce our import and domestic transportation costs. As the cost of transportation and raw materials come down, we are working with our suppliers to ensure that our prices are competitive to support sales and to protect our margins. \n We have sophisticated cost optimization tools that track prices of the underlying components of the products we sell. So the teams are well informed for these discussions. We are also holding our suppliers accountable to drive out costs through their productivity just as we are doing throughout our own organization. \n We are also partnering with our suppliers through our Lowe's One Roof Media Network. Some of our top suppliers have already locked in sizable contracts for 2023, and we are excited to partner with them to strategically target the home improvement shopper to drive traffic on Lowes.com and convert to sale. \n Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our merchants and our inventory and supply chain teams, along with our vendor partners for their hard work and continued support throughout 2022. I'm looking forward to what we will accomplish together in 2023 as we continue to find ways to provide value to our shared customers. \n Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Well, Brandon, and for Michael, what we talked about in December, private brands certainly gives us an opportunity in categories where a national brand isn't relevant. Private brands carry a better margin. They offer the consumer some additional choices.\n As it relates to promotional activity, we want to continue to offer the customers value, but we're not adding new promotions for 2023. Yes. Thanks, Brandon. And Peter, we started setting our stores in the South, Deep South, early January. And I think what's nice to see is spring start to come in the way it's supposed to come. And you start to see sales of product in fertilizer, chemicals, landscape products start to occur the way they're supposed to occur. And so we're encouraged by that. February can always be a wildcard month. But certainly, in these months -- in these Deep south and South markets seeing it kind of progress the way it's supposed to. No. I think the one area that the team may see different activity on is in appliances, and you guys have to remember that roughly 100,000 appliances break every day. And so there's always going to be an offer in the marketplace for appliances driven by the manufacturers, supported by the retailers. \n So that's one area supply has improved. Those offers are out there for appliance products. But no additional promotions."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for their unwavering commitment to serving our customers and delivering another solid year of operating results. Associates are the heart of any retailer, but even more so in our industry where customers rely on our associates' product knowledge as they look for the right solutions to repair and upgrade their homes. That's why we are so focused on becoming the employer of choice in retail, where associates chose to stay to build their careers. \n As Marvin mentioned, we've made substantial wage investments over the last 4 years, and we constantly review each market and monitor candidate flow to help us remain competitive and maintain a robust hiring pool in all geographic areas of the company. \n Beyond competitive compensation, we offer comprehensive benefits, flexible scheduling options and bonus opportunities. As we close out the year, we are excited to award $220 million in discretionary and profit sharing bonuses. This includes $70 million for our assistant store managers and supply chain supervisors with an incremental $7,500 bonus this quarter on top of their annual incentive bonus, and we are one of only a handful of retailers to offer share-based compensation for our ASMs and which incentivizes them to build their careers at Lowe's. These critical leaders are undoubtedly some of the hardest working leaders in our company, and they are at the forefront of creating a culture focused on exceptional customer service. \n In addition to recognizing these leaders, we are also awarding $150 million to eligible hourly associates in recognition of their efforts this year. Based on continuous associate listening we also added other improvements this quarter, including sick leave for part-time associates in revamping our store break rooms with higher quality, lower-cost, food options. Our investments in our people have helped us build more than 80% of leadership positions from within over the last year with more than 90% of our store leaders starting as hourly associates. \n As we enter spring, our busiest time of year, I'm pleased that we have the best staffing levels that we've had in 3 years. Our focus on associates also translates into how we're serving the Pro, which is our biggest opportunity for growth. This quarter, we launched a Know the Pro training, helping our associates understand how to better serve Pro customers across the entire store, not just at the Pro desk. This training supported storewide participation in key Q4 Pro events, including the most successful PROVember we've ever had as well as our MVPs bonus days, which exceeded expectations. \n I would like to thank our associates, especially our Pro team for delivering outstanding results, driving U.S. Pro comps of 10% for the quarter, 36% on a 2-year basis despite commodity deflation. \n We continue to leverage our MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program to capitalize on this demand by engaging Pros, incentivizing purchases and building long-term loyalty. Our program is designed to make every Pro feel like an MVP regardless of their size, giving small to midsize Pros, access to bonus points, savings and exclusive offers that they can't get elsewhere. \n We're pleased to see the results continue to exceed expectations as reflected in our 200 basis points increase in Pro customer satisfaction scores in Q4. \n Shifting gears to our focus on productivity. We continue to make progress with our PPI or perpetual productivity improvement initiatives. One of the key objectives of PPI is simplifying our associates jobs while removing friction for our customers. This approach allows us to generate productivity and cost savings in the store while simultaneously improving customer service. \n One great example of this is the transition of our outdated legacy technology to our new modern omnichannel systems. We just completed the conversion at our returns desk with easy-to-use touchscreens that enable associates to quickly scan items and process to correct return value, with the system automatically accounting for return policies and promotions. This simplifies the return experience for customers, gives our suppliers more insights to improve product quality, while also making it easier for associates to enforce our policies and manage complex returns. \n We also continue to roll out new tools, including 90,000 additional Zebra smartphones by the end of June, to ensure all associates walking the sales floor have a device, including our MST associates. \n Our leadership team knows that when we make things easier for our associates, they make things easier for our customers. And our new returns process is just one example of the dozens of initiatives underway to do just that. And of course, none of this would be possible without our associates. \n For our associates tuning in, thank you for your ongoing focus on serving customers and driving productivity. We appreciate your hard work. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And Joe, thanks for the question. As it relates to the Pro and the market, Marvin made his prepared comments. But as you dig deeper, there's kind of 5 key areas that we look at, which is the jobs how far out the Pro is booked in the next 6 months. Materials, can they get what they need and is it the right cost? Can they get to Pro Credit? What does the labor market look like? And then just the balance of the type of work they do. \n So remodel versus new construction. And as we track these and as we roll out our Pro loyalty program, we're pleased with the trajectory of the business and the health of this small Pro that we're servicing. Yes. Karen, thanks for the question. And as it relates to our frontline associates, I'm very pleased with our staffing right now. This is the best staffing we've had in 3 years. And our spring hiring as the markets come into season is ahead of expectations. So very pleased with the team's ability to staff and pivot wherever the challenges are. So thanks for the question. And listen, we're really pleased with the asset protection team. The entire industry has pressure from ORC. Our asset protection team has rolled out some new, innovative things for safety, for shrink, and so we see the outlook good."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe's Companies Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President of Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2022.\n Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our total company comparable sales increased 2.2%, while U.S. comps increased 3%. These better-than-expected sales were driven by improved DIY demand supported by fall nesting trends as travel slowdown and children return to school.\n We also saw continued momentum in Pro, reflecting the success of our Pro initiatives and the resilience of home improvement demand. In addition to strong sales growth, our persistent focus on productivity once again drove improved operating performance with substantial improvement in adjusted operating margin of 54 basis points and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.27, an increase of 20% as compared to last year.\n These outstanding results enable us to make critical investments in our most important asset, our associates. In this quarter, we announced an incremental $170 million investment in permanent wage increases for our frontline hourly associates. These increases are designed to ensure that our more tenured associates continue to receive market-competitive wages.\n And in further recognition of the hard work and dedication, we are awarding $200 million in bonuses to our frontline hourly associates ahead of the holiday season. At Lowe's, we make every effort to ensure that our associates share in our financial success, and I am very pleased that we are once again able to award a discretionary bonus because our performance is tracking ahead of our expectations.\n This is a true win-win outcome for the company, for our shareholders and for our associates. All of these investments reflect our efforts and our commitment to become the employee of choice in retail, where we continually invest in our associates and help them support their families and grow their careers at Lowe's.\n Now turning to Pro. We delivered growth of 16% and 36% on a 2-year basis, the tenth consecutive quarter that we've driven double-digit Pro growth. We are building on our greatly improved Pro product and service offerings with our new MVP Pro Rewards and Partnership Program and our enhanced Pro CRM, which Joe will discuss later on the call. We recently completed our annual Pro Pulse Survey, which provides real-time insights into what's on the minds of our Pros and how they view their future business opportunities, and we're encouraged to hear that Pros remain optimistic with over 70% saying that they expect even more work in 2023 than they had in 2022. This is just another proof point of the resilience of home improvement demand even in this uncertain macro environment. \n On Lowes.com sales grew 12% this quarter over 4x our U.S. growth rate, representing a sales penetration of 10%. We continue to enhance the online user experience as well as our fulfillment capabilities as we focus on driving this critical growth initiative within our Total Home Strategy.\n Turning to our supply chain transformation. We've made significant strides in our rollout of our market delivery model for big and bulky products this quarter, spanning the country from Southern California to Southern Illinois to Atlanta, Georgia. We've now reached an important milestone with 8 geographic regions covering more than half our stores converted to the new model, and we're on track to complete the rollout by the end of next year.\n This is a centerpiece of our supply chain transformation as the market delivery model will enable us to further consolidate our industry leadership position in appliances and position us for profitable growth in other big and bulky products like grills, riding lawn mowers, stock cabinets and vanities. This also improves the customer experience through expanded fulfillment options and a seamless omnichannel shopping experience powered by technology. \n We also just announced that we will be opening a new coastal holding facility in the port city of Suffolk, Virginia. Our expanded coastal holding facility network is opening up capacity for us to hold product upstream from our distribution centers, which creates the flexibility we need to flow the products quickly and where and when is needed. This helps us to not only capture sales, but also mitigates markdown risk because we avoid stranding product unnecessarily in our stores.\n And now I'd like to discuss the macro environment and specifically address some misperceptions that I've heard about the home improvement market. You've heard me talk about this before, but demand drivers for home improvement are distinctly different from those that drive home building. So it's important not to confuse the two. And as a reminder, at Lowe's, the 3 highest correlating factors of home improvement demand are home price appreciation, age of housing stock and disposable personal income.\n So let's start with home price appreciation. Even if there is a broad-based decline in home prices, homeowners currently have a record amount of equity in their homes, nearly $330,000 on average, which remains supportive of home improvement investment. And even in the select U.S. markets where home prices have declined after a particularly steep run-up during the pandemic, we are not seeing any impact to sales; second, the average age of homes in the U.S. is over 40 years old and roughly 3 million more homes built during the housing boom in the mid-2000s, will be entering prime remodeling years by 2025, which is a key inflection point for big-ticket repairs.\n This is one of the key reasons why 2/3 of home improvement spend is nondiscretionary on repair or maintenance projects that cannot be delayed; third, consumer savings are near record highs, while disposable personal income remained strong. And more than 90% of homeowners either own their home or are locked into a low fixed mortgage insulating them from rising rates.\n On top of these 3 factors, there is a persistent 1.5 million to 2 million under supply of homes and 250,000 first-time millennial homebuyers are expected per year through 2025. This unique combination of factors is causing homeowners to trade up in place, preferring to invest in repairs and renovations to make their current homes meet their families evolving needs rather than buying a new home. And this is why we're so confident about the outlook for the home improvement industry even in a period of high inflation and rising interest rates because the key drivers of our business remain supportive.\n And with the investments that we've made to transform our business, we also have the operating agility needed to rapidly pivot if market conditions worsen. And we have a very experienced leadership team of home improvement veterans who have developed a proven playbook to respond to a slowdown. At the same time, we would not lose our focus on investing in long-term growth. Now before I close, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our recent announcement regarding our intention to sell our Canadian retail business to Sycamore Partners.\n Lowe's first entered Canada in 2007 and later expanded with the acquisition of RONA in 2016. Over the last few years, we focus on the retail fundamentals of our Canadian operations, which brought the Canadian business to profitability and improved its operating cash flows. However, for this business to achieve the profitability in line with the U.S. significant incremental capital investments would be required to streamline the banners and improve operating margins.\n By contrast, we have tremendous opportunity for continued market share and profitable growth in our U.S. home improvement business. This transaction will simplify our business model, improve our operating margins and return on invested capital while enabling us to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders. \n Brandon will provide details regarding the financial impact of the transaction later on the call. I would like to thank our entire Canadian team for their hard work and dedication to our customers, and we look forward to collaborating with Sycamore Partners and executing a seamless transition. I'd like to also extend my appreciation to our team in the U.S. for their ongoing commitment to serving customers and the communities. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, U.S. comparable sales increase 3%, reflecting solid core home improvement demand across both Pro and DIY customers. This quarter, we drove positive comps in our building products and home decor divisions, fueled by momentum with the Pro and improve DIY demand. In hardlines, comps were down slightly as we cycled over significant storm prep activities in Louisiana from Hurricane Ida in 2021 and that did not repeat at the same scale when flu radiances prepared for Hurricane Ian in 2022.  \n Overall, growth was well balanced with 8 of our 15 merchandising departments above company average. Beginning with our home decor division, the fall nesting trends that Marvin mentioned led to standout performance across core interior categories, including appliances, paint, kitchens and bath and flooring. Appliance sales were bolstered by a strong Labor Day event and higher online sales as we continue to enhance our Lowes.com user experience.\n As an example, this quarter, we began displaying delivery dates earlier in the purchase process to highlight our improved next-day delivery options. If customer needed to quickly replace a refrigerator or washer that's just stopped working, this feature now helps them focus their attention to product that's immediately available. This is especially important for Lowe's as our appliance business is skewed toward replacement within existing homes versus new housing starts. As I mentioned last quarter, we also continue to see customers trading up for innovation, like with our new Maytag Pet Pro washer with technology that removes pet hair from clothes in the wash cycle, which is exclusive to Lowe's.\n This quarter, we also launched a new exclusive home center partnership with Miele, a global leader known for high-end premium appliances. This reflects our ongoing commitment to ensuring that we have new high-quality offerings across all price points with leading products from All-Star brands like Trex, DEWALT, Owens Corning, John Deere, EGO, Honda, KitchenAid, Samsung, LG, Kohler, Moen, Whirlpool, Husqvarna and Aaron's. \n Paint delivered strong positive comps this quarter across both Pro and DIY. Many of our Pros, especially those who focus on repair and remodel work, paint is part of their larger jobs. In other words, these are Pros who paint rather than professional painters. And these Pros are starting to see the value of our new MVPs Pro Paint Rewards Program paired with our expanded job site delivery for paint. These enhanced benefits and capabilities are making it more convenient and cost-effective for Pros to purchase their paint directly from Lowe's, earning us more of their business. In our continued partnership with Sherwin-Williams, we are also upgrading our paint departments across the U.S., including a new color wall that converts all HGTV colors to Sherwin-Williams colors, which resonates with both DIY and Pro customers. \n With our new color wall, we are bringing all the colors together so that customers can easily match their favorite Sherwin-Williams paint color at our paint desk. We are also resetting some categories to pull relevant, higher margin and more frequently purchased products closer to the front of the department, make it easier for customers to get everything they need for their paint project in one trip. We plan to have half of our stores converted to this new color wall by the end of this year and roll it out everywhere by the end of next year. We are very pleased with the progress we've made in this core category in just a few short years. We are gaining traction with both the Pro and DIY, and this recent update highlights just a few ways that we plan to continue to take market share in paint. \n We also had strong positive comps in kitchens and bath, largely driven by improved in-stocks for cabinets and customers opting to trade up for larger, higher quality in-stock cabinets versus waiting for custom orders. Within flooring, vinyl flooring once again led the way as busy homeowners returning to durable, low maintenance flooring options available in popular brands like Pergo and STAINMASTER. And we're gaining momentum across our private brand portfolio, especially in STAINMASTER, Origin 21, allen + roth and Cobalt as this is just another indication of the traction that we are gaining with our Total Home Strategy.\n Turning to our performance in building products division. We continue to see broad-based balanced growth across Pro and DIY in millwork, rough plumbing, electrical, lumber and building materials, driven by strong project-related demand. We are encouraged by the DIY strength that emerged in building products this quarter as lumber prices have come down DIY consumers are reengaging in home improvement projects, they had previously put on hold leading to double-digit lumber comps in the quarter.\n In our hardlines division, as lumber demand increased, so as demand for related attachments categories like fasteners, leading to our strong positive comps in hardware.  We also continue to see a trend of customers investing in innovation. Our EGO battery now powers 75 different tools, everything from traditional outdoor power equipment like mowers, trimmers and leaf blowers to lifestyle products like camping generators and misting fans. And with the accelerated growth in battery-powered products that we're seeing, it's not surprising that EGO continues to lead the pack in battery-powered outdoor power equipment. \n Given the concerns in the marketplace, some of you have asked if we're seeing a shift away from discretionary purchases, which is what we typically expect to see in a softer macro environment. And the straightforward answer is no. We had a strong sell-through in Halloween this year with an early sell-out of our 12-foot Lighted Animated Mummy at a price point over $300. One could argue that this is one of the most discretionary items we sell. And with Halloween in total being a highly discretionary category, this continues to give us a positive indication of the strength of our consumer.\n We kicked off the holiday season with our trim and tree sets early in the quarter. We are seeing early sell-through on taller, higher-end artificial Christmas trees, which is another example of both discretionary purchasing and consumers trading up. Before I close, I'd like to thank our merchants, supply chain team and our vendor partners for their hard work and the continued partnership as they continue to provide our customers with the products that they need as we support our stores and communities in the recovery efforts from Hurricane Ian.\n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a heartfelt thank you to our associates. Our strong performance this quarter is a direct reflection of their hard work and dedication to providing excellent customer service. That's why we are so focused on becoming the employer of choice in retail where associates choose to stay to build their careers. At its core, that means providing good, stable jobs, comprehensive benefits, competitive wages and bonus opportunities.\n As Marvin mentioned, this quarter, we announced $170 million in permanent wage increases and we are awarding $200 million in bonuses ahead of the holiday season for our frontline hourly associates. This translates to up to $1,000 for eligible full-time associates and up to $500 for eligible part-time associates. As someone who started my career as an hourly associate in home improvement, I understand how meaningful this type of financial recognition can be.\n Our executive leadership team is passionate about rewarding our associates and taking care of our customers, which is demonstrated in the investments we make in both our people and in the communities we serve.\n Another example of these investments in action is the transformation of our disaster response capabilities over the last few years, which dramatically improved our ability to support communities through devastating storms like Hurricane Ian. Year round, Lowe's now has a cross-functional command center dedicated to supporting our disaster response efforts. In fact, it was these enhanced capabilities that enabled us to respond so effectively to the pandemic.\n We also deploy our emergency response teams to the hardest hit areas. These associates volunteer to lead their home stores, giving their colleagues in the impacted areas, a chance to focus on their families, and we go a step further to help impacted associates by deploying refueling stations and our mobile disaster relief trailers with showers, washers, dryers and meals and offering financial assistance through our Lowe's employee relief fund.\n In addition to demonstrating the importance of our improved disaster response capabilities, Hurricane Ian also spotlighted the value of our expanded omnichannel fulfillment options. Earlier in the quarter, Lowe's rolled out same-day delivery nationwide with more than 1,700 stores now supported by Instacart.\n This partnership allows us to deliver over 30,000 items stocked in our stores that weigh up to 60 pounds to our customers. In the days leading up to the storm, we received thousands of these same-day orders to help customers prepare and protect their homes. Customers were able to get critical items they needed like water, sand, buckets and batteries without having to leave their homes, and it continues to be a helpful option for many who need supplies in the wake of the storm.\n And we continue to optimize our parcel network in Q3, another important step in our journey to enhance our omnichannel fulfillment capabilities. We rebalanced our network to ensure our parcel stores are optimally located close to shipping hubs, and we have upgraded our technology and hardware to support faster fulfillment. Ahead of the holidays, we are on track to meet our goal of decreasing shipping times by 50%. And these are just a few of many examples of our tenacious focus on perpetual productivity improvements or PPI that are scaling across our stores over time. \n Shifting to Pro, I would like to thank our Pro team for delivering outstanding results once again this quarter, driving Pro comps over 16% for the quarter and 36% on a 2-year basis. We are leveraging our new MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program to capitalize on this continued demand by engaging Pros and incentivizing purchases and building long-term loyalty. Our program is laser-focused on helping Pros grow their business because we know that when Pros succeed, we succeed. This partnership-based approach is already paying off with higher-than-expected adoption rates and overwhelmingly positive feedback from our Pros.\n We recently asked all of our regional Vice Presidents to find Pros who do not want to sign up for our loyalty program so we can talk to them and understand why, but that proved to be a real challenge because once Pros hear the benefits, they are eager to join. So awareness and continued execution will be the key to our ongoing success. As I close, I would like to thank our associates once again for their commitment to Lowe's and our customers. Without them, the strong results that we delivered this quarter would not be possible.\n Now I'll turn it over to Brandon. \nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Joe. I would like to begin this morning by providing additional details regarding our recent announcement of our intention to sell our Canadian business. As Marvin mentioned, despite making meaningful progress in improving our Canadian retail business over the past few years, it has continued to lag our U.S. operations and sales growth, operating profit and return on invested capital. In fact, the Canadian business represents approximately 60 basis points of dilution on our full year operating margin outlook. And during the quarter, we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $2.1 billion related to this business. \n Looking ahead, this transaction makes us a U.S.-focused business and gives us a clear line of sight to meaningful long-term improvement of our sales productivity, operating margin and return on invested capital in particular. We are excited to share our updated financial targets at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference in December.\n Turning to our Q3 results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.25 compared to $2.73 last year. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. Excluding the $2.1 billion asset impairment charge, we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.27, an increase of 20% compared to third quarter of 2021. This increase was driven by a combination of top line growth, strong P&L management and disciplined capital allocation.\n Q3 sales were $23.5 billion with comparable sales up 2.2%. Comparable average ticket increased 8%, driven by product inflation, 80 basis points of commodity inflation and higher Pro sales. Of note, FX represented a 30-basis point headwind to consolidated comps. Higher average ticket was partly offset by comp transactions declining 5.8%.\n Of note, comp transactions have improved significantly as we move through the year with Q3 over 730 basis points higher than Q1 and 60 basis points higher than Q2. U.S. comp sales were up 3% in the quarter, while sales in Canada were down 10.2% in USD, with roughly half of the decline attributable to a stronger dollar. \n Pro sales were up 16% in the quarter, driven by broad-based strength across all categories. DIY sales trends improved from Q2 with strong performance across many core home improvement categories as consumers spent more time at home following summer travel activity. DIY project-related demand also increased sequentially due to lower lumber prices. On Lowes.com, sales increased 12% in the quarter partly driven by strong appliance sales. Finally, we estimate that the net effect of storm-related sales year-over-year was relatively flat as we cycled over Hurricane Ida in the prior year. \n Our U.S. monthly comps were up 4% in August, 3.4% in September and 1.4% in October. On a 3-year basis, U.S. comps increased 33.5% in August, 37.8% in September and 42.1% in October. Gross margin was 33.3% of sales in the third quarter, up 20 basis points from last year. Product margin rate was up 110 basis points versus the prior year as we cycled over a lumber margin pressure in the third quarter of 2021, which was triggered by a steep decline in prices that began last July.\n Higher product margin rate was partly offset by 30 basis points related to higher domestic and import transportation costs as well as the expansion of our supply chain network, along with 35 basis points of pressure from shrink. Adjusted SG&A of 18.7% of sales levered 41 basis points driven by higher sales and substantial improvement in productivity. Adjusted operating profit was $3 billion, up 7% versus the prior year.  \n Operating margin rate of 12.71% of sales levered 54 basis points, driven by both higher gross margin and SG&A leverage. The adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% below the prior year rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $19.8 billion, up $3.1 billion from the same quarter last year largely driven by product inflation and higher freight costs with units roughly flat to prior year. \n This morning, we are increasing our full year 2022 financial outlook based on stronger-than-expected flow-through year-to-date. Please note that our outlook for operating margin, diluted EPS and return on invested capital are all adjusted to exclude asset impairment and expected transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business.\n We now expect 2022 sales of approximately $97 billion to $98 billion, representing comparable sales of flat to a decline of 1% as compared to prior year. Please note that at the midpoint of the range, this implies that fourth quarter comparable sales will be slightly positive. This reflects our expectations of continued strong Pro performance and steady DIY trends.\n As a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We continue to expect gross margin rate to be up slightly as compared to the prior year. As you look ahead to the fourth quarter, keep in mind that we are cycling over the second round of lumber inflation in 2021, which benefited product margins. We also expect continued shrink pressure next quarter.\n Given our disciplined focus on expense management, we now expect adjusted operating margin of approximately 13% for the full year. And we are raising our outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year from $13.10 to $13.60 to our updated range of $13.65 to $13.80. This reflects better-than-expected SG&A leverage as well as higher-than-planned share repurchase activity. We expect capital expenditures of up to $2 billion this year.\n Additionally, given our larger-than-expected $4.75 billion notes offering in Q3, we expect to accelerate share repurchase activity that we had originally planned for 2023 into this year. We now expect $13 billion in share repurchases in 2022. And finally, we are raising our outlook of adjusted return on invested capital to above 37% for the year.\n Now turning to our best-in-class capital allocation strategy. In Q3, the company generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. And through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 20.5 million shares for $4 billion. We also paid $666 million in dividends at $1.05 per share. Capital expenditures totaled $403 million in the quarter as we continue to focus on high-return projects that support our growth objectives.\n We ended the quarter at 2.5x adjusted debt to EBITDA and we are well on track to reach our target leverage of 2.75x in 2023 while also maintaining our BBB+ rating. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 27.6% inclusive of a 590 basis point impact related to the asset impairment recorded in the third quarter.\n In closing, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver shareholder value through our leading capital allocation strategy while investing in our associates and our business to drive long-term sustainable growth. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\n And our first question today comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Marvin, I wanted to maybe play devil's advocate for a second on housing. This idea that it's just taking a long time for all these pressures to catch up to the consumer in the segment. For all the reasons you cited, plus there's been some labor and product shortages. So curious how much you debate that and that there is a certain level of home price depreciation that's going to eventually weigh on this customer. \nMarvin Ellison: No, I appreciate the question. And here's what I would say. When we look at markets around the country where we saw an aggressive increase in home prices during the pandemic, now you can see some of those prices start to fall. Those markets are performing at the same rate of performance as other markets. So we're already seeing due to the life cycle of home price appreciation and home price declines around the U.S., signals of kind of what the broader macro may look like in months, quarters and years in the future.\n The great thing about operating stores in every state and in virtually every ZIP code is that you have a pretty good sample size of kind of what's currently happened, but also what future trends may look like. And we're not trying to spend the data. I mean, trust me, we're looking at this every day like you are, but from a different vantage point, trying to understand demand patterns.\n But the reality still remains that home prices have appreciated at record levels, as I said in my prepared comments, on average, $330,000 per home. The facts are that homes are older than they've been since World War II. And 2/3 of our business is nondiscretionary because when your house get older, things break. That's just commonplace.\n The facts are that we have more personal disposable income today than we had before the pandemic. And that's primarily in the bank accounts of homeowners. And the fact we saw it was still 1.5 million to 2 million homes under current demand because of the lack of home building coming out of the financial crisis in 2008, 2009. So those are just facts. And when we look at and try to forecast our business, we have to ask one simple question. historically, what data points correlate closely to demand patterns for lows. And what I just outlined to you are the data points that correlate to demand patterns, and that's what we look at. \nSimeon Gutman: Yes. That's a fair point. I'll jump off of housing and maybe go back to the business. If you look at the things Lowe's can be doing better, and obviously, you're executing against all the plans that you put in place since you've joined. Does it involve higher CapEx, maybe reallocation of CapEx? Or is it mostly execution in process? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, I would say from a CapEx standpoint, we have no expectation to go above our current capital allocation dollar amount of roughly $2 billion per year. We'll have our investor conference next month, and I can just give you a little bit of a precursor. That's what the number is going to be for next year. So as we look at things that we still have to catch up, and I'll be very transparent, we're not where we want to be. We still have a supply chain transformation process that's underway, but we can get all that accomplished and stay within that $2 billion CapEx dollar amount.\n We still have significant IT investments that we need to make. We made incredible improvement, but all those things also fall within that current allocation of CapEx. Bill is working to continue to improve merchandising and pricing systems. Again, those things are all mapped out. They're costed out, and we have a good understanding of it. And we feel like at $2 billion of CapEx will allow us to achieve all of these things. And again, we'll speak to those in more specificity next month in New York. But what I will say to you is, yes, are we working on execution? We are, but I can tell you right now, I couldn't be more pleased with our ability to execute at a high level and arguably the most difficult retail environment of our lifetimes.\n Anytime you could be a $100 billion company, and you can be so dependent on the global supply chain, and you can manage inventory with basically flat to negative units for the whole year as we have, that tells you that the degree of execution and collaboration is at a high level. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Your big competitor yesterday talked about seeing some early signs of deceleration in the business in areas like grills, are you seeing any of those similar signs? And separate what do you think drove the acceleration in October on a monthly -- on a 3-year monthly stack basis? \nMarvin Ellison: So Michael, I'll take the first part of that. I'll let Bill Boltz come in and provide some perspective. But when we look across all of our merchandising departments. We don't have any really red blinking lights of concern relative to certain categories, certain items, certain SKUs. Obviously, when you start to get into different times of the year, we're going to have performance changing based on customer demand.\n So we didn't have an anticipation that grills would be a top-selling category in the third quarter. It tends not to be the same with patio. And as we spoke to a lot of detail last quarter, we do believe there was some degree of pull forward in some of these more seasonal discretionary categories. But we are not seeing anything that feels or looks like a trade down or consumer pullback.\n I mean, to the contrary, the third quarter was our best performing DIY quarter of the year. And that customer segment tends to be kind of the indicator for us on the overall health of our business. The Pro has been strong all year. And the good news is for the first time this year, we saw continued strength in Pro, and we saw sequential improvement in DIY.\n So that is something that gives us confidence that things are headed in the right direction. I'll let Bill talk about what performed well in the third quarter relative to product categories that really gave us a really strong 2- to 3-year stack for that mark. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And Michael, I think just a couple of things. We see -- as we go into Q3, we see a shift away from a heavy reliance on seasonal like we do typically in Q2. Yet there was still some seasonal business to be had in Q3, and that helped us as the weather was favorable. We -- as I said in my prepared remarks, our building products business continued to perform well, and we continue to see strength really across all of our Pro-related categories. And then the shift to indoor, as you see, appliances, kitchen and bath, flooring, paint, those businesses, both on a DIY and the Pro side continue to do well. And then holiday with Halloween and then the early sets of our trim and tree categories were what we saw in Q3. And then our online business continued to perform well in Q3 as well. \nJoseph McFarland: Michael, this is Joe. I'll add just one additional point. And that's our new MVP Pro Rewards Program that we have been discussing. And so when I look at our adoption rates being way better than expected, the new Pro CRM platform and then just a combination of our strong credit offering along with Pro loyalty gives us a lot of confidence in that business as well. \nMarvin Ellison: Awesome. \nMichael Lasser: But my follow-up question is at the risk of pulling forward a little bit of your messaging from a couple of weeks now. Your SG&A dollars have been very well contained over the last few quarters, leading to the idea that maybe Lowe's doesn't have as much cushion in its cost structure in the event that there could be a downturn in home improvement demand, either because of housing or just a weakening labor market. Why is that wrong? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, I would say it's wrong based on the performance in Q1, just use that as your data point, the season broke late top line was not what we anticipated yet we still leverage operating margin for the quarter. We see that as an example of the levers that we now have in place to be agile. As I said in my prepared comments, we've got a lot of experience sitting around this table. There's very few things that we have not seen.\n We have a really strong playbook developed. And we think that if the market turns more negative than we may anticipate, then we have the ability to pull those levers and perform really well. As a matter of fact, we're not giving you the details, Brandon is going to spend a bit of time next month at the investor conference outlined some of those levers and the agility we built so that we can be really, really swift to react to any market conditions. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: Congratz. Nice quarter again. My first question, again, I don't want to have the risk of sign nitpick I mean given the strength in the business, and as Michael just pointed out in his question, the -- basically the 6 accelerating trends through Q3, and then you talked about the initial strength in seasonal with the Mummy sales. Why not lift sales guidance for the year, especially in a when you're lifting earnings guidance? \nMarvin Ellison: So I'll give you the philosophical perspective, and I'll let Brandon give you the financial perspective. As you know, Brian, there's a lot of unknown out there. And so we're not going to be overly bullish for no reason. You had a midterm election that still candidly hadn't been quite determined. You have aggressive action from the Fed. You have global geopolitical events happening. And so we're just being, what I'll describe as appropriately conservative. Do we have confidence in our business? Absolutely.\n Do we have confidence in what we're going to deliver for the holiday season, you bet we do. And we think we have a great plan for the balance of this quarter and going into next year. But in an environment where there's so much concern in the macro. We just felt it was appropriate to just be conservative. So our decision not to live guidance has nothing to do with our lack of confidence. It's just more about being prudent and not being overly aggressive in an environment where there's a lot of on asset micro questions. So I'll let Brandon add some additional detail. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Brian, this is Brandon. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, we looked at 3-year comps did see sequential improvement as we moved across the quarter. The Q3 exit rates were strong. Bill mentioned the improvement specifically in the interior DIY-related categories. The midpoint of our full year guide is flat to down 1%, which implies a slightly positive comp for Q4. And if you recall back in August, we were guiding actually to the bottom end of that range of flat to down 1%. I will cite that the commodity volatility and the impact Q3 to Q4.\n With lumber where it is, we've actually seen a benefit of 80 basis points to comps in Q3. If the pricing runs out into Q4, we're expecting that to actually flip to a 90-basis point drag. So that's about 170 basis point swing. Again, that's taken where we are from a benchmark perspective of below about $500 and running that out and comparing that to where lumber prices inflated round 2 of last year. So all in, excluding lumber, and the differences I just cited, the Pro comp momentum is expected to continue and the DIY trends that Bill mentioned are expected to continue through Q4. \nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. I appreciate the color there. Then my follow-up question, in separate topic. there is with regard to supply chain. So Marvin, you keep talk -- you highlighted that there's a lot of success that you've had in improving the low supply chain internally. By most measures, now the external environment for supply chain is getting better with shipping costs and such. So I guess the question, are you seeing that? And then recognizing you haven't given guidance yet for 2023, but to the extent these external supply chain issues continue to correct. Could that be a tailwind of some sort as we hit over the next several quarters? \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. Look, it's a great question, Brian. And without getting in front of what we're going to discuss next month, I would say that the short answer is, yes, there are elements of the supply chain that definitely will give us some cost advantages next year. Brandon is going to be very transparent and very detailed on kind of what we see going into next year.\n And obviously, supply chain is going to be a big component of that. In addition to just the overall cost environment for supply chain, we're going to talk about strategic initiatives as well that we're excited about because as far as much work as we've done in supply chain, as I mentioned earlier, we still see it as one of our key opportunities to improve. There's not a great retailer in the world that doesn't have a great supply chain, and we're committed to having a great supply chain. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. \nElizabeth Lane: Just as you think about the makeup of comp going forward between transactions and average ticket. You mentioned that in some categories where you saw inflation moderate. You saw a subsequent increase in transactions. Does that give you confidence going forward that as inflation does start to moderate it will be -- that average ticket decline or lower growth rate would be offset by a pickup in transactions? \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Liz, this is Brandon. I think on the inflation front, we do continue to see high single-digit inflation this quarter, inclusive of about 80 basis points that I mentioned earlier of commodity inflation. Our consumer does continue to be resilient. We haven't seen any significant trade down. In fact, we've actually seen trade up in place across a number of categories.\n And our Q4 forecast, which we're focused on at this point, we're expecting that to continue at the high single-digit mark. We are going to get some relief related to lumber pricing that I mentioned earlier, so that net 170 basis point swing. But for Q4, that's the forecast is that the inflation is going to continue to lift our ticket, which is going to be the primary driver of our comp and it's going to be offset by transactions being down in Q4. \nElizabeth Lane: And then just looking out beyond Q4, as you think about the potential outlook for comps going forward and how that ticket versus transactions could play out. I mean, one of the pushbacks that we get is that if ticket remains -- if ticket starts to come down, but transactions remain negative, that would be a severe headwind to comp. I'm just curious how you're thinking about that outlook going forward. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Liz, we're going to hold until December to really give you a deep view there. We'll have an updated view of the macro, the comp scenarios within that and specifically the makeup of our comp and we'll plan to go into details there on December 7. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. \nZachary Fadem: So following up on the SG&A dollar question, as you've been able to take out a couple of hundred million of SG&A in both Q1 and Q2. And while Q3 was basically flat, it looks like your Q4 SG&A embeds a pretty notable step-up in trend, even excluding the extra week. So can you just help me understand the puts and takes on the SG&A line in a little bit more detail and perhaps talk through the impact of the efficiency initiatives? And then also to what extent you're able to flex up and down labor with the lower volumes today. \nMarvin Ellison: So Zack, I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll let Brandon and maybe, Joe, provide some additional detail. So for us, I think the key thing to understand is we have what we call PPI perpetual productivity improvement initiatives. And we're going to go into some level of detail on how this has become more of cultural process across the whole company at the investor conference next week. But specific to your question, we still believe that we have technology investments that we can make in the store environment specifically to where we can continue to drive SG&A leverage while improving customer service.\n But it's easier to drive SG&A leverage, if you're just pulling payroll out indiscriminately. But what Joe and his team has done we've actually improved leverage in the store from an expense and payable standpoint and concurrently drove up customer service. And that's the key. And that's really all about technology investments. So we think that there's still additional initiatives on our project road map that will continue to give us those benefits. I'll let Brandon take the more financial part of your question and then if Joe can add something else about payroll and how we can adjust it rather quickly relative to the demands that we're seeing from the consumers in our stores. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Zack, this is Brandon. The only thing I would add implied our SG&A is expected to lever in Q4. And just as a reminder, we are cycling an incentive payout from 2021 in Q4. But I would just add to what Marvin said, continuing to drive substantial PPI initiatives store tech modernization, front-end transformation, managing back office spend.\n So we're really proud of the progress that we've made, as we mentioned earlier, expecting to significantly outperform from an EBIT standpoint even in declining sales for the full year. And we'll tell you more about what we have in store 2023 in December. \nMarvin Ellison: And Zack, I'm going to let Joe talk about the activity-based model that drives our payroll system in the stores. So you can get a sense that we just don't have a blanket approach. We generate payroll based on a number of transactions and footsteps, and we think that's the best way to look at it. So Joe, you can expound on that. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. And so thanks, Marvin. What I'd tell you is with our labor system that we have implemented in the last few years, this is really detailed, is down to by store, by department, by day, by time of day, in addition, as you think back in the last several years, our 60-40 initiatives to align the associates with customers and then the tasking activities.\n We've gone through a series of steps that continued pay go-forward dividends for us. And we have a lot of confidence in our ability to navigate to continue with the large investments we've been making. I think in 2023 will be a transformative year for us from an IT system standpoint and the ease of what we're doing. \nZachary Fadem: Got it. Appreciate all the color there. And then, Marvin, you've mentioned in the past about 2/3 of your business is tied to repair and maintenance activity. And then the remaining 1/3 of your business, to what extent would you say those sales are tied to housing turnover or home price appreciation? And then considering the slowing in these housing metrics, how do you characterize the current demand environment for repair and maintenance activity, which is more stable and recurring versus sales that are perhaps more discretionary or bigger ticket in nature. \nMarvin Ellison: No. Zack, it's a fair question. What I will tell you is that we're seeing strength in both areas. So obviously, when you see 19% growth in Pro, 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit Pro growth, then that tells you that there's big ticket projects going on that are remodel in nature but are also what I would call upgrade in nature. We talked about trading up in place, and that is a phenomenon that we're seeing because the 1.5 million to 2 million shortages of homes in the high interest rate environment is just incentivizing homeowners to keep their low fixed rate and modify their existing home.\n And so because of that, you're seeing a combination of older homes getting the maintenance and repair to falls in that 2/3. But then you see the other 1/3 to simply upgrading and improving the environment, a new kitchen, finishing the basement, a new bathroom, et cetera. And so we're seeing a combination of all of those things. And as Bill walked through the different merchandising department of performance. You can see it embedded in all of those different results. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. Great results. My first question is on inventory. It looks like the inventory sales spread widened a bit sequentially in 3Q. From our store check, it looks like your in-stock positions are the best they've been in years. So is it safe to say that the majority of that inventory increase year-over-year is tied to average unit cost? And on that topic, how should we think about inventory levels tracking at the end of 4Q? That's my first question. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Jonathan, this is Brandon. So I would say inventory overall, we feel, is in a really solid position. Balance is up 19% and driven exclusively by product cost inflation and freight units are flat. As you mentioned, our in-stock rates continue to improve across all of our categories.\n We're continuing to make investments in Pro specifically in those high demand SKUs. We feel like we got the right levels to support the expected demand that we see for Q4 and into '23. And in reference to Q4, we do expect the inventory to build over Q4 with early ordering, I think for springs consistent compared to pre-pandemic levels. We are seeing a bit of unpredictability in the supply chain due to the zero-COVID policy in China.\n But just also as a reminder, when we look at our seasonal businesses, specifically, we do start setting south and deep south in Q4, and then we're also maneuvering around Chinese New Year, which is the latter part of January. So it's going to be critical that we're in stock for spring, and we're making those decisions based on lead times and supplier health across each of our categories. \nJonathan Matuszewski: That's really helpful. And then a quick big picture question on Pro for you, Marvin. Lowe's continues to have great traction there. It looks like the multiyear comp held up this quarter at 36%. So when you think about the recent share gains with the Pro, curious if the drivers have evolved at all. If you could talk through how much new Pro customer acquisition has been driving Pro sales versus greater wallet share from existing Pros? That would be great, and whether you're seeing any change in those 2 drivers? \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you for the question. We don't give a lot of external information on number of new customers down to that level of specificity. But what I will tell you is that our new loyalty program is absolutely driving new Pro customers and it's driving more return visits of existing customers, which is exactly what we wanted. And a key data point is this, when a Pro customer is enrolled in our Pro Rewards platform and credit, they shop 3x more.\n So that is the key data point. And so in Joe's scripted comments, he talked about the adoption rate and how it really comes down to our ability to engage the Pro. And when we engage them and educate them, they tend to adopt the program. So I'll let Joe provide a little bit more context on Pro. But we're really pleased with the progress and equally pleased that we saw the DIY customer come back strong in third quarter than we've seen them all year. \nJoseph McFarland: Jonathan, and then just a couple of things to add. First off, our Pro team here at Lowe's is just full of deep experience inside sales, outside sales, and they've done a really nice job. And so we're still in the early stages of the MVPs Pro Program, but very, very pleased with the adoption that we're seeing. So we've spoken a little bit in the past about our Pro CRM platform. So we have the ability to better anticipate Pro's needs and drive sales.\n And then this really does a nice job of what we call leveling the playing field so that every Pro is important and has the ability to earn points no matter what the size. And so things like purchase-based offers, then completing different actions to deepen their relationship with Lowe's. And so we'll continue pressing forward here, but very pleased with the Pro progress. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at our Analyst and Investor Conference on December 7. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Lowe's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brandon Sink",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. I would like to begin this morning by providing additional details regarding our recent announcement of our intention to sell our Canadian business. As Marvin mentioned, despite making meaningful progress in improving our Canadian retail business over the past few years, it has continued to lag our U.S. operations and sales growth, operating profit and return on invested capital. In fact, the Canadian business represents approximately 60 basis points of dilution on our full year operating margin outlook. And during the quarter, we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $2.1 billion related to this business. \n Looking ahead, this transaction makes us a U.S.-focused business and gives us a clear line of sight to meaningful long-term improvement of our sales productivity, operating margin and return on invested capital in particular. We are excited to share our updated financial targets at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference in December.\n Turning to our Q3 results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.25 compared to $2.73 last year. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. Excluding the $2.1 billion asset impairment charge, we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.27, an increase of 20% compared to third quarter of 2021. This increase was driven by a combination of top line growth, strong P&L management and disciplined capital allocation.\n Q3 sales were $23.5 billion with comparable sales up 2.2%. Comparable average ticket increased 8%, driven by product inflation, 80 basis points of commodity inflation and higher Pro sales. Of note, FX represented a 30-basis point headwind to consolidated comps. Higher average ticket was partly offset by comp transactions declining 5.8%.\n Of note, comp transactions have improved significantly as we move through the year with Q3 over 730 basis points higher than Q1 and 60 basis points higher than Q2. U.S. comp sales were up 3% in the quarter, while sales in Canada were down 10.2% in USD, with roughly half of the decline attributable to a stronger dollar. \n Pro sales were up 16% in the quarter, driven by broad-based strength across all categories. DIY sales trends improved from Q2 with strong performance across many core home improvement categories as consumers spent more time at home following summer travel activity. DIY project-related demand also increased sequentially due to lower lumber prices. On Lowes.com, sales increased 12% in the quarter partly driven by strong appliance sales. Finally, we estimate that the net effect of storm-related sales year-over-year was relatively flat as we cycled over Hurricane Ida in the prior year. \n Our U.S. monthly comps were up 4% in August, 3.4% in September and 1.4% in October. On a 3-year basis, U.S. comps increased 33.5% in August, 37.8% in September and 42.1% in October. Gross margin was 33.3% of sales in the third quarter, up 20 basis points from last year. Product margin rate was up 110 basis points versus the prior year as we cycled over a lumber margin pressure in the third quarter of 2021, which was triggered by a steep decline in prices that began last July.\n Higher product margin rate was partly offset by 30 basis points related to higher domestic and import transportation costs as well as the expansion of our supply chain network, along with 35 basis points of pressure from shrink. Adjusted SG&A of 18.7% of sales levered 41 basis points driven by higher sales and substantial improvement in productivity. Adjusted operating profit was $3 billion, up 7% versus the prior year.  \n Operating margin rate of 12.71% of sales levered 54 basis points, driven by both higher gross margin and SG&A leverage. The adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% below the prior year rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $19.8 billion, up $3.1 billion from the same quarter last year largely driven by product inflation and higher freight costs with units roughly flat to prior year. \n This morning, we are increasing our full year 2022 financial outlook based on stronger-than-expected flow-through year-to-date. Please note that our outlook for operating margin, diluted EPS and return on invested capital are all adjusted to exclude asset impairment and expected transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business.\n We now expect 2022 sales of approximately $97 billion to $98 billion, representing comparable sales of flat to a decline of 1% as compared to prior year. Please note that at the midpoint of the range, this implies that fourth quarter comparable sales will be slightly positive. This reflects our expectations of continued strong Pro performance and steady DIY trends.\n As a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We continue to expect gross margin rate to be up slightly as compared to the prior year. As you look ahead to the fourth quarter, keep in mind that we are cycling over the second round of lumber inflation in 2021, which benefited product margins. We also expect continued shrink pressure next quarter.\n Given our disciplined focus on expense management, we now expect adjusted operating margin of approximately 13% for the full year. And we are raising our outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year from $13.10 to $13.60 to our updated range of $13.65 to $13.80. This reflects better-than-expected SG&A leverage as well as higher-than-planned share repurchase activity. We expect capital expenditures of up to $2 billion this year.\n Additionally, given our larger-than-expected $4.75 billion notes offering in Q3, we expect to accelerate share repurchase activity that we had originally planned for 2023 into this year. We now expect $13 billion in share repurchases in 2022. And finally, we are raising our outlook of adjusted return on invested capital to above 37% for the year.\n Now turning to our best-in-class capital allocation strategy. In Q3, the company generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. And through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 20.5 million shares for $4 billion. We also paid $666 million in dividends at $1.05 per share. Capital expenditures totaled $403 million in the quarter as we continue to focus on high-return projects that support our growth objectives.\n We ended the quarter at 2.5x adjusted debt to EBITDA and we are well on track to reach our target leverage of 2.75x in 2023 while also maintaining our BBB+ rating. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 27.6% inclusive of a 590 basis point impact related to the asset impairment recorded in the third quarter.\n In closing, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver shareholder value through our leading capital allocation strategy while investing in our associates and our business to drive long-term sustainable growth. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Yes, Brian, this is Brandon. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, we looked at 3-year comps did see sequential improvement as we moved across the quarter. The Q3 exit rates were strong. Bill mentioned the improvement specifically in the interior DIY-related categories. The midpoint of our full year guide is flat to down 1%, which implies a slightly positive comp for Q4. And if you recall back in August, we were guiding actually to the bottom end of that range of flat to down 1%. I will cite that the commodity volatility and the impact Q3 to Q4.\n With lumber where it is, we've actually seen a benefit of 80 basis points to comps in Q3. If the pricing runs out into Q4, we're expecting that to actually flip to a 90-basis point drag. So that's about 170 basis point swing. Again, that's taken where we are from a benchmark perspective of below about $500 and running that out and comparing that to where lumber prices inflated round 2 of last year. So all in, excluding lumber, and the differences I just cited, the Pro comp momentum is expected to continue and the DIY trends that Bill mentioned are expected to continue through Q4. Yes, Liz, this is Brandon. I think on the inflation front, we do continue to see high single-digit inflation this quarter, inclusive of about 80 basis points that I mentioned earlier of commodity inflation. Our consumer does continue to be resilient. We haven't seen any significant trade down. In fact, we've actually seen trade up in place across a number of categories.\n And our Q4 forecast, which we're focused on at this point, we're expecting that to continue at the high single-digit mark. We are going to get some relief related to lumber pricing that I mentioned earlier, so that net 170 basis point swing. But for Q4, that's the forecast is that the inflation is going to continue to lift our ticket, which is going to be the primary driver of our comp and it's going to be offset by transactions being down in Q4. Yes, Liz, we're going to hold until December to really give you a deep view there. We'll have an updated view of the macro, the comp scenarios within that and specifically the makeup of our comp and we'll plan to go into details there on December 7. Yes, Zack, this is Brandon. The only thing I would add implied our SG&A is expected to lever in Q4. And just as a reminder, we are cycling an incentive payout from 2021 in Q4. But I would just add to what Marvin said, continuing to drive substantial PPI initiatives store tech modernization, front-end transformation, managing back office spend.\n So we're really proud of the progress that we've made, as we mentioned earlier, expecting to significantly outperform from an EBIT standpoint even in declining sales for the full year. And we'll tell you more about what we have in store 2023 in December. Yes. Jonathan, this is Brandon. So I would say inventory overall, we feel, is in a really solid position. Balance is up 19% and driven exclusively by product cost inflation and freight units are flat. As you mentioned, our in-stock rates continue to improve across all of our categories.\n We're continuing to make investments in Pro specifically in those high demand SKUs. We feel like we got the right levels to support the expected demand that we see for Q4 and into '23. And in reference to Q4, we do expect the inventory to build over Q4 with early ordering, I think for springs consistent compared to pre-pandemic levels. We are seeing a bit of unpredictability in the supply chain due to the zero-COVID policy in China.\n But just also as a reminder, when we look at our seasonal businesses, specifically, we do start setting south and deep south in Q4, and then we're also maneuvering around Chinese New Year, which is the latter part of January. So it's going to be critical that we're in stock for spring, and we're making those decisions based on lead times and supplier health across each of our categories."

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our total company comparable sales increased 2.2%, while U.S. comps increased 3%. These better-than-expected sales were driven by improved DIY demand supported by fall nesting trends as travel slowdown and children return to school.\n We also saw continued momentum in Pro, reflecting the success of our Pro initiatives and the resilience of home improvement demand. In addition to strong sales growth, our persistent focus on productivity once again drove improved operating performance with substantial improvement in adjusted operating margin of 54 basis points and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.27, an increase of 20% as compared to last year.\n These outstanding results enable us to make critical investments in our most important asset, our associates. In this quarter, we announced an incremental $170 million investment in permanent wage increases for our frontline hourly associates. These increases are designed to ensure that our more tenured associates continue to receive market-competitive wages.\n And in further recognition of the hard work and dedication, we are awarding $200 million in bonuses to our frontline hourly associates ahead of the holiday season. At Lowe's, we make every effort to ensure that our associates share in our financial success, and I am very pleased that we are once again able to award a discretionary bonus because our performance is tracking ahead of our expectations.\n This is a true win-win outcome for the company, for our shareholders and for our associates. All of these investments reflect our efforts and our commitment to become the employee of choice in retail, where we continually invest in our associates and help them support their families and grow their careers at Lowe's.\n Now turning to Pro. We delivered growth of 16% and 36% on a 2-year basis, the tenth consecutive quarter that we've driven double-digit Pro growth. We are building on our greatly improved Pro product and service offerings with our new MVP Pro Rewards and Partnership Program and our enhanced Pro CRM, which Joe will discuss later on the call. We recently completed our annual Pro Pulse Survey, which provides real-time insights into what's on the minds of our Pros and how they view their future business opportunities, and we're encouraged to hear that Pros remain optimistic with over 70% saying that they expect even more work in 2023 than they had in 2022. This is just another proof point of the resilience of home improvement demand even in this uncertain macro environment. \n On Lowes.com sales grew 12% this quarter over 4x our U.S. growth rate, representing a sales penetration of 10%. We continue to enhance the online user experience as well as our fulfillment capabilities as we focus on driving this critical growth initiative within our Total Home Strategy.\n Turning to our supply chain transformation. We've made significant strides in our rollout of our market delivery model for big and bulky products this quarter, spanning the country from Southern California to Southern Illinois to Atlanta, Georgia. We've now reached an important milestone with 8 geographic regions covering more than half our stores converted to the new model, and we're on track to complete the rollout by the end of next year.\n This is a centerpiece of our supply chain transformation as the market delivery model will enable us to further consolidate our industry leadership position in appliances and position us for profitable growth in other big and bulky products like grills, riding lawn mowers, stock cabinets and vanities. This also improves the customer experience through expanded fulfillment options and a seamless omnichannel shopping experience powered by technology. \n We also just announced that we will be opening a new coastal holding facility in the port city of Suffolk, Virginia. Our expanded coastal holding facility network is opening up capacity for us to hold product upstream from our distribution centers, which creates the flexibility we need to flow the products quickly and where and when is needed. This helps us to not only capture sales, but also mitigates markdown risk because we avoid stranding product unnecessarily in our stores.\n And now I'd like to discuss the macro environment and specifically address some misperceptions that I've heard about the home improvement market. You've heard me talk about this before, but demand drivers for home improvement are distinctly different from those that drive home building. So it's important not to confuse the two. And as a reminder, at Lowe's, the 3 highest correlating factors of home improvement demand are home price appreciation, age of housing stock and disposable personal income.\n So let's start with home price appreciation. Even if there is a broad-based decline in home prices, homeowners currently have a record amount of equity in their homes, nearly $330,000 on average, which remains supportive of home improvement investment. And even in the select U.S. markets where home prices have declined after a particularly steep run-up during the pandemic, we are not seeing any impact to sales; second, the average age of homes in the U.S. is over 40 years old and roughly 3 million more homes built during the housing boom in the mid-2000s, will be entering prime remodeling years by 2025, which is a key inflection point for big-ticket repairs.\n This is one of the key reasons why 2/3 of home improvement spend is nondiscretionary on repair or maintenance projects that cannot be delayed; third, consumer savings are near record highs, while disposable personal income remained strong. And more than 90% of homeowners either own their home or are locked into a low fixed mortgage insulating them from rising rates.\n On top of these 3 factors, there is a persistent 1.5 million to 2 million under supply of homes and 250,000 first-time millennial homebuyers are expected per year through 2025. This unique combination of factors is causing homeowners to trade up in place, preferring to invest in repairs and renovations to make their current homes meet their families evolving needs rather than buying a new home. And this is why we're so confident about the outlook for the home improvement industry even in a period of high inflation and rising interest rates because the key drivers of our business remain supportive.\n And with the investments that we've made to transform our business, we also have the operating agility needed to rapidly pivot if market conditions worsen. And we have a very experienced leadership team of home improvement veterans who have developed a proven playbook to respond to a slowdown. At the same time, we would not lose our focus on investing in long-term growth. Now before I close, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our recent announcement regarding our intention to sell our Canadian retail business to Sycamore Partners.\n Lowe's first entered Canada in 2007 and later expanded with the acquisition of RONA in 2016. Over the last few years, we focus on the retail fundamentals of our Canadian operations, which brought the Canadian business to profitability and improved its operating cash flows. However, for this business to achieve the profitability in line with the U.S. significant incremental capital investments would be required to streamline the banners and improve operating margins.\n By contrast, we have tremendous opportunity for continued market share and profitable growth in our U.S. home improvement business. This transaction will simplify our business model, improve our operating margins and return on invested capital while enabling us to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders. \n Brandon will provide details regarding the financial impact of the transaction later on the call. I would like to thank our entire Canadian team for their hard work and dedication to our customers, and we look forward to collaborating with Sycamore Partners and executing a seamless transition. I'd like to also extend my appreciation to our team in the U.S. for their ongoing commitment to serving customers and the communities. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill. No, I appreciate the question. And here's what I would say. When we look at markets around the country where we saw an aggressive increase in home prices during the pandemic, now you can see some of those prices start to fall. Those markets are performing at the same rate of performance as other markets. So we're already seeing due to the life cycle of home price appreciation and home price declines around the U.S., signals of kind of what the broader macro may look like in months, quarters and years in the future.\n The great thing about operating stores in every state and in virtually every ZIP code is that you have a pretty good sample size of kind of what's currently happened, but also what future trends may look like. And we're not trying to spend the data. I mean, trust me, we're looking at this every day like you are, but from a different vantage point, trying to understand demand patterns.\n But the reality still remains that home prices have appreciated at record levels, as I said in my prepared comments, on average, $330,000 per home. The facts are that homes are older than they've been since World War II. And 2/3 of our business is nondiscretionary because when your house get older, things break. That's just commonplace.\n The facts are that we have more personal disposable income today than we had before the pandemic. And that's primarily in the bank accounts of homeowners. And the fact we saw it was still 1.5 million to 2 million homes under current demand because of the lack of home building coming out of the financial crisis in 2008, 2009. So those are just facts. And when we look at and try to forecast our business, we have to ask one simple question. historically, what data points correlate closely to demand patterns for lows. And what I just outlined to you are the data points that correlate to demand patterns, and that's what we look at. Well, I would say from a CapEx standpoint, we have no expectation to go above our current capital allocation dollar amount of roughly $2 billion per year. We'll have our investor conference next month, and I can just give you a little bit of a precursor. That's what the number is going to be for next year. So as we look at things that we still have to catch up, and I'll be very transparent, we're not where we want to be. We still have a supply chain transformation process that's underway, but we can get all that accomplished and stay within that $2 billion CapEx dollar amount.\n We still have significant IT investments that we need to make. We made incredible improvement, but all those things also fall within that current allocation of CapEx. Bill is working to continue to improve merchandising and pricing systems. Again, those things are all mapped out. They're costed out, and we have a good understanding of it. And we feel like at $2 billion of CapEx will allow us to achieve all of these things. And again, we'll speak to those in more specificity next month in New York. But what I will say to you is, yes, are we working on execution? We are, but I can tell you right now, I couldn't be more pleased with our ability to execute at a high level and arguably the most difficult retail environment of our lifetimes.\n Anytime you could be a $100 billion company, and you can be so dependent on the global supply chain, and you can manage inventory with basically flat to negative units for the whole year as we have, that tells you that the degree of execution and collaboration is at a high level. So Michael, I'll take the first part of that. I'll let Bill Boltz come in and provide some perspective. But when we look across all of our merchandising departments. We don't have any really red blinking lights of concern relative to certain categories, certain items, certain SKUs. Obviously, when you start to get into different times of the year, we're going to have performance changing based on customer demand.\n So we didn't have an anticipation that grills would be a top-selling category in the third quarter. It tends not to be the same with patio. And as we spoke to a lot of detail last quarter, we do believe there was some degree of pull forward in some of these more seasonal discretionary categories. But we are not seeing anything that feels or looks like a trade down or consumer pullback.\n I mean, to the contrary, the third quarter was our best performing DIY quarter of the year. And that customer segment tends to be kind of the indicator for us on the overall health of our business. The Pro has been strong all year. And the good news is for the first time this year, we saw continued strength in Pro, and we saw sequential improvement in DIY.\n So that is something that gives us confidence that things are headed in the right direction. I'll let Bill talk about what performed well in the third quarter relative to product categories that really gave us a really strong 2- to 3-year stack for that mark. Awesome. Well, I would say it's wrong based on the performance in Q1, just use that as your data point, the season broke late top line was not what we anticipated yet we still leverage operating margin for the quarter. We see that as an example of the levers that we now have in place to be agile. As I said in my prepared comments, we've got a lot of experience sitting around this table. There's very few things that we have not seen.\n We have a really strong playbook developed. And we think that if the market turns more negative than we may anticipate, then we have the ability to pull those levers and perform really well. As a matter of fact, we're not giving you the details, Brandon is going to spend a bit of time next month at the investor conference outlined some of those levers and the agility we built so that we can be really, really swift to react to any market conditions. So I'll give you the philosophical perspective, and I'll let Brandon give you the financial perspective. As you know, Brian, there's a lot of unknown out there. And so we're not going to be overly bullish for no reason. You had a midterm election that still candidly hadn't been quite determined. You have aggressive action from the Fed. You have global geopolitical events happening. And so we're just being, what I'll describe as appropriately conservative. Do we have confidence in our business? Absolutely.\n Do we have confidence in what we're going to deliver for the holiday season, you bet we do. And we think we have a great plan for the balance of this quarter and going into next year. But in an environment where there's so much concern in the macro. We just felt it was appropriate to just be conservative. So our decision not to live guidance has nothing to do with our lack of confidence. It's just more about being prudent and not being overly aggressive in an environment where there's a lot of on asset micro questions. So I'll let Brandon add some additional detail. Yes. Look, it's a great question, Brian. And without getting in front of what we're going to discuss next month, I would say that the short answer is, yes, there are elements of the supply chain that definitely will give us some cost advantages next year. Brandon is going to be very transparent and very detailed on kind of what we see going into next year.\n And obviously, supply chain is going to be a big component of that. In addition to just the overall cost environment for supply chain, we're going to talk about strategic initiatives as well that we're excited about because as far as much work as we've done in supply chain, as I mentioned earlier, we still see it as one of our key opportunities to improve. There's not a great retailer in the world that doesn't have a great supply chain, and we're committed to having a great supply chain. So Zack, I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll let Brandon and maybe, Joe, provide some additional detail. So for us, I think the key thing to understand is we have what we call PPI perpetual productivity improvement initiatives. And we're going to go into some level of detail on how this has become more of cultural process across the whole company at the investor conference next week. But specific to your question, we still believe that we have technology investments that we can make in the store environment specifically to where we can continue to drive SG&A leverage while improving customer service.\n But it's easier to drive SG&A leverage, if you're just pulling payroll out indiscriminately. But what Joe and his team has done we've actually improved leverage in the store from an expense and payable standpoint and concurrently drove up customer service. And that's the key. And that's really all about technology investments. So we think that there's still additional initiatives on our project road map that will continue to give us those benefits. I'll let Brandon take the more financial part of your question and then if Joe can add something else about payroll and how we can adjust it rather quickly relative to the demands that we're seeing from the consumers in our stores. And Zack, I'm going to let Joe talk about the activity-based model that drives our payroll system in the stores. So you can get a sense that we just don't have a blanket approach. We generate payroll based on a number of transactions and footsteps, and we think that's the best way to look at it. So Joe, you can expound on that. No. Zack, it's a fair question. What I will tell you is that we're seeing strength in both areas. So obviously, when you see 19% growth in Pro, 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit Pro growth, then that tells you that there's big ticket projects going on that are remodel in nature but are also what I would call upgrade in nature. We talked about trading up in place, and that is a phenomenon that we're seeing because the 1.5 million to 2 million shortages of homes in the high interest rate environment is just incentivizing homeowners to keep their low fixed rate and modify their existing home.\n And so because of that, you're seeing a combination of older homes getting the maintenance and repair to falls in that 2/3. But then you see the other 1/3 to simply upgrading and improving the environment, a new kitchen, finishing the basement, a new bathroom, et cetera. And so we're seeing a combination of all of those things. And as Bill walked through the different merchandising department of performance. You can see it embedded in all of those different results. Thank you for the question. We don't give a lot of external information on number of new customers down to that level of specificity. But what I will tell you is that our new loyalty program is absolutely driving new Pro customers and it's driving more return visits of existing customers, which is exactly what we wanted. And a key data point is this, when a Pro customer is enrolled in our Pro Rewards platform and credit, they shop 3x more.\n So that is the key data point. And so in Joe's scripted comments, he talked about the adoption rate and how it really comes down to our ability to engage the Pro. And when we engage them and educate them, they tend to adopt the program. So I'll let Joe provide a little bit more context on Pro. But we're really pleased with the progress and equally pleased that we saw the DIY customer come back strong in third quarter than we've seen them all year."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, U.S. comparable sales increase 3%, reflecting solid core home improvement demand across both Pro and DIY customers. This quarter, we drove positive comps in our building products and home decor divisions, fueled by momentum with the Pro and improve DIY demand. In hardlines, comps were down slightly as we cycled over significant storm prep activities in Louisiana from Hurricane Ida in 2021 and that did not repeat at the same scale when flu radiances prepared for Hurricane Ian in 2022.  \n Overall, growth was well balanced with 8 of our 15 merchandising departments above company average. Beginning with our home decor division, the fall nesting trends that Marvin mentioned led to standout performance across core interior categories, including appliances, paint, kitchens and bath and flooring. Appliance sales were bolstered by a strong Labor Day event and higher online sales as we continue to enhance our Lowes.com user experience.\n As an example, this quarter, we began displaying delivery dates earlier in the purchase process to highlight our improved next-day delivery options. If customer needed to quickly replace a refrigerator or washer that's just stopped working, this feature now helps them focus their attention to product that's immediately available. This is especially important for Lowe's as our appliance business is skewed toward replacement within existing homes versus new housing starts. As I mentioned last quarter, we also continue to see customers trading up for innovation, like with our new Maytag Pet Pro washer with technology that removes pet hair from clothes in the wash cycle, which is exclusive to Lowe's.\n This quarter, we also launched a new exclusive home center partnership with Miele, a global leader known for high-end premium appliances. This reflects our ongoing commitment to ensuring that we have new high-quality offerings across all price points with leading products from All-Star brands like Trex, DEWALT, Owens Corning, John Deere, EGO, Honda, KitchenAid, Samsung, LG, Kohler, Moen, Whirlpool, Husqvarna and Aaron's. \n Paint delivered strong positive comps this quarter across both Pro and DIY. Many of our Pros, especially those who focus on repair and remodel work, paint is part of their larger jobs. In other words, these are Pros who paint rather than professional painters. And these Pros are starting to see the value of our new MVPs Pro Paint Rewards Program paired with our expanded job site delivery for paint. These enhanced benefits and capabilities are making it more convenient and cost-effective for Pros to purchase their paint directly from Lowe's, earning us more of their business. In our continued partnership with Sherwin-Williams, we are also upgrading our paint departments across the U.S., including a new color wall that converts all HGTV colors to Sherwin-Williams colors, which resonates with both DIY and Pro customers. \n With our new color wall, we are bringing all the colors together so that customers can easily match their favorite Sherwin-Williams paint color at our paint desk. We are also resetting some categories to pull relevant, higher margin and more frequently purchased products closer to the front of the department, make it easier for customers to get everything they need for their paint project in one trip. We plan to have half of our stores converted to this new color wall by the end of this year and roll it out everywhere by the end of next year. We are very pleased with the progress we've made in this core category in just a few short years. We are gaining traction with both the Pro and DIY, and this recent update highlights just a few ways that we plan to continue to take market share in paint. \n We also had strong positive comps in kitchens and bath, largely driven by improved in-stocks for cabinets and customers opting to trade up for larger, higher quality in-stock cabinets versus waiting for custom orders. Within flooring, vinyl flooring once again led the way as busy homeowners returning to durable, low maintenance flooring options available in popular brands like Pergo and STAINMASTER. And we're gaining momentum across our private brand portfolio, especially in STAINMASTER, Origin 21, allen + roth and Cobalt as this is just another indication of the traction that we are gaining with our Total Home Strategy.\n Turning to our performance in building products division. We continue to see broad-based balanced growth across Pro and DIY in millwork, rough plumbing, electrical, lumber and building materials, driven by strong project-related demand. We are encouraged by the DIY strength that emerged in building products this quarter as lumber prices have come down DIY consumers are reengaging in home improvement projects, they had previously put on hold leading to double-digit lumber comps in the quarter.\n In our hardlines division, as lumber demand increased, so as demand for related attachments categories like fasteners, leading to our strong positive comps in hardware.  We also continue to see a trend of customers investing in innovation. Our EGO battery now powers 75 different tools, everything from traditional outdoor power equipment like mowers, trimmers and leaf blowers to lifestyle products like camping generators and misting fans. And with the accelerated growth in battery-powered products that we're seeing, it's not surprising that EGO continues to lead the pack in battery-powered outdoor power equipment. \n Given the concerns in the marketplace, some of you have asked if we're seeing a shift away from discretionary purchases, which is what we typically expect to see in a softer macro environment. And the straightforward answer is no. We had a strong sell-through in Halloween this year with an early sell-out of our 12-foot Lighted Animated Mummy at a price point over $300. One could argue that this is one of the most discretionary items we sell. And with Halloween in total being a highly discretionary category, this continues to give us a positive indication of the strength of our consumer.\n We kicked off the holiday season with our trim and tree sets early in the quarter. We are seeing early sell-through on taller, higher-end artificial Christmas trees, which is another example of both discretionary purchasing and consumers trading up. Before I close, I'd like to thank our merchants, supply chain team and our vendor partners for their hard work and the continued partnership as they continue to provide our customers with the products that they need as we support our stores and communities in the recovery efforts from Hurricane Ian.\n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And Michael, I think just a couple of things. We see -- as we go into Q3, we see a shift away from a heavy reliance on seasonal like we do typically in Q2. Yet there was still some seasonal business to be had in Q3, and that helped us as the weather was favorable. We -- as I said in my prepared remarks, our building products business continued to perform well, and we continue to see strength really across all of our Pro-related categories. And then the shift to indoor, as you see, appliances, kitchen and bath, flooring, paint, those businesses, both on a DIY and the Pro side continue to do well. And then holiday with Halloween and then the early sets of our trim and tree categories were what we saw in Q3. And then our online business continued to perform well in Q3 as well."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a heartfelt thank you to our associates. Our strong performance this quarter is a direct reflection of their hard work and dedication to providing excellent customer service. That's why we are so focused on becoming the employer of choice in retail where associates choose to stay to build their careers. At its core, that means providing good, stable jobs, comprehensive benefits, competitive wages and bonus opportunities.\n As Marvin mentioned, this quarter, we announced $170 million in permanent wage increases and we are awarding $200 million in bonuses ahead of the holiday season for our frontline hourly associates. This translates to up to $1,000 for eligible full-time associates and up to $500 for eligible part-time associates. As someone who started my career as an hourly associate in home improvement, I understand how meaningful this type of financial recognition can be.\n Our executive leadership team is passionate about rewarding our associates and taking care of our customers, which is demonstrated in the investments we make in both our people and in the communities we serve.\n Another example of these investments in action is the transformation of our disaster response capabilities over the last few years, which dramatically improved our ability to support communities through devastating storms like Hurricane Ian. Year round, Lowe's now has a cross-functional command center dedicated to supporting our disaster response efforts. In fact, it was these enhanced capabilities that enabled us to respond so effectively to the pandemic.\n We also deploy our emergency response teams to the hardest hit areas. These associates volunteer to lead their home stores, giving their colleagues in the impacted areas, a chance to focus on their families, and we go a step further to help impacted associates by deploying refueling stations and our mobile disaster relief trailers with showers, washers, dryers and meals and offering financial assistance through our Lowe's employee relief fund.\n In addition to demonstrating the importance of our improved disaster response capabilities, Hurricane Ian also spotlighted the value of our expanded omnichannel fulfillment options. Earlier in the quarter, Lowe's rolled out same-day delivery nationwide with more than 1,700 stores now supported by Instacart.\n This partnership allows us to deliver over 30,000 items stocked in our stores that weigh up to 60 pounds to our customers. In the days leading up to the storm, we received thousands of these same-day orders to help customers prepare and protect their homes. Customers were able to get critical items they needed like water, sand, buckets and batteries without having to leave their homes, and it continues to be a helpful option for many who need supplies in the wake of the storm.\n And we continue to optimize our parcel network in Q3, another important step in our journey to enhance our omnichannel fulfillment capabilities. We rebalanced our network to ensure our parcel stores are optimally located close to shipping hubs, and we have upgraded our technology and hardware to support faster fulfillment. Ahead of the holidays, we are on track to meet our goal of decreasing shipping times by 50%. And these are just a few of many examples of our tenacious focus on perpetual productivity improvements or PPI that are scaling across our stores over time. \n Shifting to Pro, I would like to thank our Pro team for delivering outstanding results once again this quarter, driving Pro comps over 16% for the quarter and 36% on a 2-year basis. We are leveraging our new MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program to capitalize on this continued demand by engaging Pros and incentivizing purchases and building long-term loyalty. Our program is laser-focused on helping Pros grow their business because we know that when Pros succeed, we succeed. This partnership-based approach is already paying off with higher-than-expected adoption rates and overwhelmingly positive feedback from our Pros.\n We recently asked all of our regional Vice Presidents to find Pros who do not want to sign up for our loyalty program so we can talk to them and understand why, but that proved to be a real challenge because once Pros hear the benefits, they are eager to join. So awareness and continued execution will be the key to our ongoing success. As I close, I would like to thank our associates once again for their commitment to Lowe's and our customers. Without them, the strong results that we delivered this quarter would not be possible.\n Now I'll turn it over to Brandon. Michael, this is Joe. I'll add just one additional point. And that's our new MVP Pro Rewards Program that we have been discussing. And so when I look at our adoption rates being way better than expected, the new Pro CRM platform and then just a combination of our strong credit offering along with Pro loyalty gives us a lot of confidence in that business as well. Yes. And so thanks, Marvin. What I'd tell you is with our labor system that we have implemented in the last few years, this is really detailed, is down to by store, by department, by day, by time of day, in addition, as you think back in the last several years, our 60-40 initiatives to align the associates with customers and then the tasking activities.\n We've gone through a series of steps that continued pay go-forward dividends for us. And we have a lot of confidence in our ability to navigate to continue with the large investments we've been making. I think in 2023 will be a transformative year for us from an IT system standpoint and the ease of what we're doing. Jonathan, and then just a couple of things to add. First off, our Pro team here at Lowe's is just full of deep experience inside sales, outside sales, and they've done a really nice job. And so we're still in the early stages of the MVPs Pro Program, but very, very pleased with the adoption that we're seeing. So we've spoken a little bit in the past about our Pro CRM platform. So we have the ability to better anticipate Pro's needs and drive sales.\n And then this really does a nice job of what we call leveling the playing field so that every Pro is important and has the ability to earn points no matter what the size. And so things like purchase-based offers, then completing different actions to deepen their relationship with Lowe's. And so we'll continue pressing forward here, but very pleased with the Pro progress."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2022. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website.  \n Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone.  In the second quarter, our total company comparable sales declined 0.3%, while U.S. comps increased 0.2%. For the quarter, Pro sales remained strong. In fact, this is the ninth consecutive quarter that we've driven double-digit Pro growth. As a reminder, at Lowe's, 75% of our sales are driven by the DIY customer while 25% of our sales is from the Pro. And while underlying home improvement trends remain strong, our DIY sales were lower than expected in the second quarter and the first half of the year.  \n As I mentioned on our previous call, the timing of spring disproportionately impacts DIY sales as many seasonal categories like lawn and garden are heavily concentrated in DIY. In addition to spring arriving late, it also ended early, quickly moving from a cold winter to a hot summer in some regions. This showed in the planting season and pressured lawn and garden sales.  \n Also, while we plan for a modest sector pullback this year as we lap outsized DIY consumer demand, we now believe that certain categories like patio and grills are disproportionately impacted by the unprecedented demand from 2020 and 2021. This unprecedented demand was likely fueled by the combination of 3 rounds of government stimulus, an increase in consumer savings rate and a temporary shift away from spending on services towards spending on goods, including home improvement products. These factors drove more discretionary purchases over the past 2 years than it was possible to precisely measure at the time.  \n And some of you have asked whether we're seeing consumers trade down in their purchase activity. At this point, we are not seeing indications of material trade down. If anything, we're seeing the opposite with continued strong demand for our new and innovative products at higher price points. Bill will provide more context on our customer spending trends later in the call.  \n To summarize, our DIY trends, despite slower sales in select discretionary categories like patios and grills, the DIY customer remains resilient, which reflects continued strong home improvement demand trends.  \n Now turning to Pro. We continue to outperform the market, delivering growth of 13% and 37% on a 2-year basis. We're particularly pleased with the momentum we're seeing with our Pro loyalty program, MVP's Pro Rewards, which is designed to make every Pro feel like an MVP regardless of the size of their business. Because time is money for Pros, one of the most valuable ways that we can serve them is by saving them time with enhanced fulfillment. Therefore, we are actively piloting convenient fulfillment options, including a new Pro fulfillment center in Charlotte, and gig network solutions that offer same-day delivery for both Pro and DIY. Joe will provide a further update on our strategic initiatives to improve Pro penetration later on the call.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 7% this quarter, representing a sales penetration of nearly 10%. We're continuing to invest in omnichannel capabilities because we believe there is still tremendous runway for further growth ahead. In Canada, Q2 performance lagged the U.S. And as a reminder, because our Canadian business is more heavily weighted towards lumber, it disproportionately benefited from record high lumber prices last year.  \n Let me now discuss our operating performance for the second quarter. I'm particularly pleased with the operating discipline that we've developed across our business, which is demonstrated by our ability to improve operating margin once again despite lower sales. During the quarter, operating margin expanded 12 basis points, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.67, which is an increase of nearly 10% versus last year. The progress also reflects our team's disciplined focus on our perpetual productivity initiatives or PPI. Not only did PPI support our first half operating margin improvement, it will also help to drive operating leverage for the balance of the year and for the next several years. Joe will discuss the success of our PPI initiatives in more detail later in the call.  \n Now I'd like to address some concerns that I've heard from our shareholders about the home improvement market. I want to begin by clarifying that the market dynamics that pressure the home builder are not necessarily the same market dynamics that pressure the home improvement retailer. At Lowe's, the 3 highest correlating factors of home improvement demand are home price appreciation, the age of the housing stock and disposable personal income. While housing turnover is important, it does not index at the same rate as home price appreciation, housing age and disposable personal income.  \n And while we acknowledge that housing turnover has slowed, home prices and home equity remains at record highs, which gives customers confidence that they will get a return on the investment that they make in their homes. And also importantly, those homes keep getting older. More than half of the homes in the U.S. are over 40 years old and millions more built at the peak of the housing boom in the early 2000s are now starting to turn 20 years old, which is a key inflection point for big-ticket repairs.  \n In terms of disposable personal income, household wealth is still at an all-time high. Consumer savings are roughly $2.6 trillion higher than they were pre-pandemic. And 75% of that excess savings is concentrated in middle- and high-income households who are more likely to be homeowners, which highlights another key benefit of our industry, our core customer is the homeowner.  \n In addition to having significantly more disposable income, most homeowners are benefiting from lower fixed mortgage rates. And as low housing supply and high interest rates make moving less desirable, homeowners are motivated to invest in their current homes to fit their needs. This is one of the key reasons that home improvement can win in markets when housing turnover is strong and when it slows as we saw in the mid-1990s when home improvement spend grew despite rising interest rates and a slowdown in housing turnover.  \n Now shifting to trends in Pro. We continuously survey our Pros and their confidence in their job prospects is the highest it's been in years. The Pro is busier than ever, and the strength of the Pro backlog speaks to the significant pent-up demand for their services. In short, we are fortunate to operate in this retail sector and despite the macro uncertainty and unprecedented seasonal demand in the past 2 years, our long-term outlook for the home improvement industry and the Pro customer remains positive.  \n As I close, I would like to personally thank our associates for their hard work and dedication. In recognition of some of the cost pressures they are facing due to high inflation, we are providing an incremental $55 million in bonuses to our hourly frontline associates this quarter. These associates have the most important jobs in our company, and we deeply appreciate everything they do to serve our customers to deliver a best-in-class experience.  \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.  In the second quarter, U.S. comparable sales were up 0.2%. I'd like to walk you through the trends that we are seeing in the business, beginning with our DIY results. As Marvin mentioned, we had a short spring moving directly from winter to summer in many areas of the country, impacting demand for outdoor garden products like fertilizer, chemicals and live nursery. After 2 years of outsized growth in home-related sales, we plan for sales to slow in certain categories this year. And our disciplined planning process enabled us to mitigate many of the inventory pressures you're seeing across the retail industry.  \n But certain categories were still down more than expected, like patio furniture and outdoor grills, which is consistent with trends across the broader market. But even within patio, our newly designed Origin 21 items sold out first in most stores, like our exclusive Brennfield egg  chair that retailed at $628.  \n Another interesting trend from the quarter is the ongoing demand for innovation, reflecting underlying consumer strength. Rather than seeing trade down, in many cases, we are seeing customers trade up, spending more to purchase the latest technology like battery-powered products available in the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands. In fact, one of our top-performing products this quarter was an EGO 56-volt self-propelled mower that retailed for over $700. This unit dramatically outperformed our sales forecast despite being one of the most expensive battery mowers in our assortment, proven what we have said before that value doesn't have to be low priced.  \n In Refrigeration, we continue to see consumers trade up to higher-priced products in brands like KitchenAid, Samsung and LG, with features and benefits that serve a busy family's lifestyle. And while client sales were below our expectations, we continue to take incremental share and lead the market as the #1 appliance retailer in the U.S. We also continue to source new products that make projects easier for our DIY savvy customers, like our expanded STAINMASTER lineup, including laminate flooring, sheet vinyl and tile, which are getting overwhelmingly positive customer feedback due to how easy they are to install and keep clean. Or how about our new build-in Batten product, a Lowe's exclusive? This new pre-sized and miter molding makes it easy and cost-effective for the do-it-yourself or to do highly intricate designs like wanes coating.  \n And for the Pro, it saves them time on these jobs as well. Customers can transform a wall in a day for less than $300. And across the store and within each of our merchandising categories, we offer value at all price points and feature leading products from our all-star brands like  Trex, Owens Corning, John Deere, EGO, Honda, KitchenAid, Samsung, LG, Kohler, Moen, Whirlpool, Husqvarna and Aaron's.  \n Shifting gears now to our Pro customer, we delivered broad-based and strong results with positive comps across rough plumbing, building materials, paint, electrical, millwork and hardware. We are pleased with the traction that we are making with this important customer and we continue to optimize our Pro assortments to ensure we offer the products Pros need from the brands that they know and trust.  \n This quarter, we launched Eden Creek, a liquid additive that improves the quality, durability and sustainability of concrete projects. We also launched the new stack lithium battery technology in our line of FLEX cordless power tools, making Lowe's now the only destination to have this new battery technology available in both FLEX and DEWALT, which brings more power in a smaller package.  \n And in millwork, we also were the first to market with our own reliable stock exterior black trim vinyl window, an increasingly popular trend to give homes a more premium look, with some Pros even buying pallets of these products before they even hit our shelves. We also added JELD-WEN prefinished interior doors, which come pre-painted from the factory, saving Pros the time and expense required to paint the door. These additions have further strengthened our portfolio of trusted programs like Bosch, Crescent, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.\n In our lumber business, comps declined modestly as we cycled over record high prices in the previous year. However, unit volumes were up significantly year-over-year, which reflects the strong underlying project demand.  \n Turning now to Lowes.com, sales grew 7%, building on top of the tremendous growth we have seen over the past few years. We continue to invest in the online user experience by expanding and enhancing our assortments, building out and improving our visualizer and configurator tools, and enhancing the delivery experience to make it easier for our customers to track their orders.  \n As I close, I'd like to thank my entire merchandising team, along with our finance, inventory and supply chain teams for their disciplined inventory management and planning process in a complex retail environment. And lastly, I'd also like to thank our vendor partners for their continued partnership and hard work to ensure our customers have the products they need for every home improvement project they tackle.  \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.  \n Let me begin by expressing my appreciation for our associates. They delivered strong customer service and profitability this quarter due to their commitment to our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. Over the first half of the year, we have made meaningful strides. I'd like to spend some time now discussing what we are focused on for the remainder of 2022, including how we continue to simplify our store processes.  \n Earlier this year, we launched what we call Project Simple in our stores, one of our many PPI initiatives with a focus on further reducing daily duplicative tasks that distract from customer service and drive needless expense. In fact, as we continue rolling out Project Simple, we expect that it will eliminate over 80 nonproductive hours per store per week in the second half.  \n In February, I discussed the launch of our game-changing, new store inventory management system, or SIMS. While we are just 6 months into the implementation, we are already seeing strong results. With the improved inventory visibility, we are reducing nonproductive hours the associates spend searching for product while also improving the customer shopping experience, in-store and online.  \n And in the second half, we will leverage SIMS for an exciting new feature, prescriptive pack down. This new process will provide specific downstocking instructions to our associates based on sell-through rates. So they know whether the product needs to go directly on to the shelf or the end cap bypassing the top stock altogether. This drives a more efficient, proactive replenishment and inventory planning process.  \n As these examples illustrate, PPI is not a static set of initiatives that will expire at a predetermined date. PPI's perpetual process of ongoing initiatives that will continue to deliver productivity, not only in the second half, but for many quarters to come.  \n Now shifting our focus to the Pro. We continue to deliver incredible results with Pro comps of over 13% in the quarter. In fact, this is the ninth quarter in a row that we have driven double-digit Pro comps. Even in a quarter that is traditionally our most DIY-heavy, we saw Pro penetration of over 23% in the U.S., an increase of over 500 basis points from 2019.  \n And we are further enhancing our Pro offering with our new MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program. This Pro loyalty program launched in the first quarter, and it continues to outperform our expectations.  \n In July, we launched MVP's Bonus Points in conjunction with our first-ever Lowe's MVP bonus days event with a focus on the products that Pros use every day. Pros earn extra bonus points on our leading brands such as DEWALT, Valspar, FLEX, Metabo, A.O. Smith and Frigidaire. Our Pros can redeem their points for other products or gift cards in the MVP Pro Reward Center. It is their choice, and we made it easy for all Pros to benefit.  \n As our MVP's Pro Rewards program continues to mature in the second half, we are excited to present our Pros with compelling offers that will be tailored just for them.  \n Before I close, let me discuss the investments that we are making in our most important asset, our associates, as we strive to become the employer of choice in retail. We recently announced expanded scheduling options for our full-time associates. Most full-time associates can now request a fixed 4-day work week, fixed days off or even choose their preferred shift providing them with predictability on their terms. This is a significant improvement in our associates' quality of life, and it is another way that we are differentiating ourselves from other retailers. \n As Marvin mentioned, to help our frontline hourly associates during this period of high inflation, we are awarding an incremental bonus of $55 million. Also for a designated time frame, we are providing our associates with an additional 10% discount on everyday household and cleaning items. Associates can now purchase these products at a 20% discount, which we hope will ease the burden of inflation impacting many of these items. We will continue to look for meaningful ways to improve our associates work-life balance, while providing them with the tools to build a career at Lowe's. I would like to thank our associates once again for their commitment to Lowe's and to our customers. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Brandon. \nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Joe. Let me begin with our Q2 results. We delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.67, an increase of 9.9% compared to prior year as we drove productivity in a dynamic operating environment. Q2 sales were $27.5 billion, with comparable sales down 0.3%. Comparable average ticket increased 6.1% as higher Pro sales and product inflation drove higher average ticket. This was offset by comp transactions declining 6.4% as we cycle over 2 years of outsized growth in DIY sales. \n Comp transactions improved over 650 basis points sequentially from Q1. U.S. comp sales were up 0.2% in the quarter. Our sales were impacted by the shortened spring season, lower demand in certain DIY discretionary categories and lower-than-expected lumber prices. This was partially offset by a 13% increase in Pro customer sales. On Lowes.com, sales increased 7% in the quarter. \n Our U.S. monthly comps were down 1.5% in May, up 0.9% in June and up 1.1% in July. Gross margin was 33.24% of sales in the second quarter, down 54 basis points from last year. This is consistent with the expectations that we discussed in May. As expected, product margin rate was down 35 basis points versus the prior year. \n Lumber prices declined significantly from late April through mid-June. As we sold through our higher-cost inventory layers, product margin rate was pressured. Higher transportation costs, both import and domestic as well as the expansion of our supply chain network, also drove 35 basis points of pressure. Additionally, we experienced 10 basis points of shrink pressure largely due to live goods damaged by unseasonable weather. \n These impacts were partly offset by 30 basis points related to more favorable product mix. Despite the product cost pressures in the quarter, gross margin for the first half was up slightly compared to the first half of 2021. This reflected our ability to effectively navigate a volatile lumber market over the first half of the year as well as product cost inflation. I'm very pleased with the strong cross-functional collaboration from the teams as well as our diligent planning efforts. \n SG&A of 16.22% levered 80 basis points relative to Q2 2021. We drove substantial productivity across the enterprise in the quarter against slightly lower sales. Operating profit was $4.2 billion, up slightly versus the prior year. Operating margin rate of 15.39% of sales levered 12 basis points as SG&A leverage was partly offset by lower gross margin rate. The effective tax rate was 24.5%, in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $19.3 billion, up $2 billion or 11.6% from Q2 last year driven by product cost inflation of 15%, while units were down low single digits. \n This morning, we are affirming our full year 2022 financial outlook. We now expect that our 2022 sales will be near the bottom of our range of approximately $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales towards the bottom end of the range of down 1% to up 1% for the year. This reflects our first half results and our second half expectations of continued Pro momentum and improving DIY sales trends. We continue to expect Pro to outperform DIY for the remainder of the year. \n As a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We continue to expect gross margin rate to be up slightly as compared to the prior year. \n Given our better-than-expected flow-through in the first half, we now expect operating margin to be at the top end of our range of 12.8% to 13% for the full year. Our ability to lever gross margin and SG&A despite lower-than-expected sales reflects the company's focus, hard work and effective investments over the last several years. Taking all of this into consideration, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year to be at the top end of the range of $13.10 to $13.60. \n At Lowe's, we remain committed to our best-in-class capital allocation strategy. For 2022, we continue to expect approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures and $12 billion in share repurchases. Finally, we are affirming our outlook of return on invested capital above 36% for the year. \n Turning to our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy. In Q2, the company generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow. And through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.5 billion to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 21.6 million shares for $4 billion. We also paid $524 million in dividends at $0.80 per share and we announced a 31% increase to $1.05 per share in support of our 35% target dividend payout ratio. \n Capital expenditures totaled $344 million in the quarter as we invest in the business to support our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to make progress towards our target of 2.75x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR, ending the quarter at 2.23x, and we remain committed to maintaining our BBB+ rating. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 34.5% in the quarter, up 548 basis points versus last year. \n As I look ahead, I'm highly confident that we are making the right investments in our people and capabilities to support our business and drive meaningful long-term shareholder value. And with that, we will open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question is DIY comps are negative and units are down. the units appear to be bottoming or still decelerating. And do you have a view if we rebaseline this year or there's more to go in '23? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. So, Simeon, this is Brandon. Just as we look at DIY specifically, the business was heavily weighted to DIY seasonal in the first half of the year, I think, underperformed a bit just due to the weather, the pull forward that we mentioned in patio and grills. Second half of the year, transitioning more to the core the interior of the store. And in particular, post-July 4, over the last 6 weeks, we've seen continued momentum building in these categories. \n We've seen a clear step-change in the business, 1- to 3-year comps improving, again, in particular, in Pro and core interior. And then I'll point back to transactions, Q1, Simeon, down 13. We saw improvement in Q2 down 6. So we like the momentum we're seeing and optimistic around the step-changes again that we're seeing in the second half. \nMarvin Ellison: Simeon, this is Marvin. I think it's important to note that when you look at the first half of the year, the first half is obviously more seasonal. And so we had weather impacts that drove a lot of our negative units, if you think about outdoor lawn and garden, chemicals, et cetera. And then if you think about what we talked about the unprecedented demand we saw in the last couple of years in some of these DIY discretionary categories, specifically, patio and grills. We're not going to experience the seasonality of the business in the second half of the year, and we're not going to experience that unprecedented overlap in those 2 highly seasonal discretionary categories. \nSimeon Gutman: And maybe, Marvin, if I can ask you a follow-up. I know we have this Analyst Day later in the year, and you're coming off of a couple of years of historic top line growth, and you've been able to get to margin goals much faster. Do you sense or do you feel that these gains keep going as long as sales productivity keeps rising? Or do you feel like there's any part of you that says, \"Hey, we could pause, reinvest and then we can even drive faster growth in the out years? \nMarvin Ellison: Simeon, it's a really good question. I think it depends on the financial category. So I'll remind you that home improvement is a $900 billion marketplace. And I think it's easy to just focus on the 2 largest players and determine the overall market share gain just based on that, but this is a really fragmented marketplace. So on the revenue side, we absolutely believe that we have an incredible wrong way to continue to grow, just focus specifically on the fact that our Pro penetration is hovering around 23% to 25%. And we know we can get that number significantly higher. \n Now the good news is, as Joe mentioned, is increased 500 basis points since 2019. So on the sales revenue side, we think we have an incredible opportunity to continue to grow. On operating margin, I mean, we said consistently that 12% was not a plateau. It was a baseline. Now we're going to say the same thing about 13%. We think when we hit that plateau, it's just going to be another baseline that we can continue to grow from. Joe talked about the importance of our PPI initiatives that is not a static list, but this is something that we see benefit in future quarters and candidly future years. So in both those areas, we think that we have room to grow, and we look forward to providing a very detailed outlook at the December conference. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: We wondered if you could talk a little bit more about your inventory composition cost per unit versus units. And then this inventory seem to be lower than your competitor. Just what is your view on current in-stocks? And are you chasing any categories? \nMarvin Ellison: So, Kate, I'll take the first part of that, and I'll let Brandon and Bill jump in. I would say, first and foremost, I am extremely pleased with the disciplined collaboration and planning that's taken place to put us in a really good inventory position vis-a-vis the retail industry. Any time you could have units declining in this environment with supply chain constraints and just incredible difficulties in forecasting, it points to a lot of hard work. \n So the headline is we feel really good about our current inventory position, and we feel good about our in-stock position in the second half of the year versus last year. So I'm going to let Brandon talk a little bit about the financial expression and I'll let Bill talk about where we are and where we feel like that we're in a much better position versus what we've been in past years and past quarters. \nBrandon Sink: Kate, this is Brandon. The only thing I would add in the prepared remarks, we talked about units being down. I think it has allowed us to make the needed investments, in particular, in the Pro space as we've seen momentum there. To continue to support demand, we've had improved in-stocks and in certain areas that we struggled a bit through the pandemic. So as Marvin said, really pleased where we are from an inventory position. \n We're managing seasonal, just like we would every year. In-stock levels are better than they've been here over the last 2.5 years. And any expected exit of seasonal fully included in the margin expectations that we have for second half. \nWilliam Boltz: And Brandon, the only thing I would add is that the quality level of the inventory is good, although there are still categories across the store that we want to see improvements in. And so we're continuing to work with our vendor partners to do that, working with our supply chain teams in order to expedite that product to the store into the shelf and the teams are working on those. And -- but the quality level of inventory this year versus last year is dramatically better than it's been. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: First question, just like the operating agility you guys have shown has been impressive, clearly. How do you ensure you're not sacrificing service levels as you manage these SG&A dollars? Any metrics that you can share that maybe give you confidence that service levels in the stores are still holding up? \nMarvin Ellison: Peter, it's a really good question. Obviously, we pay very close attention to what we describe as service levels versus as task levels. And the thing that Joe and the store operators have done an incredible job is investing in service while taking hours away from tasks. So when you see that SG&A leverage, it's not like the old days where you just kind of rip payroll out and you risk service. \n What Joe and his team have done a masterful job of is pulling hours away from non-customer-facing parts of the store, taking some of those dollars to the bottom line, but then reinvesting dollars on the service side. So I'll let Joe give you some specifics. But the headline is likelihood to recommend up for both DIY and Pro in the quarter with SG&A leverage, and that is not easy to do. So, Joe, you could provide some detail. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Marvin. And listen, I think it goes back to the focus that we've had on our associates. And again, with the PPI initiatives, we're moving unnecessary daunting tasks replacing them with technology and just enabling the associates' time on the floor to be more productive. We've done things, the flexible scheduling. We've talked many times in the past about our new labor management engine. And so as we continue moving forward, we measure every single day, every single week, and we're very pleased with the progress we've made both in the operational expense and the customer experience. \nPeter Benedict: That's helpful. That's great. And then just I guess -- next question would just be around what kind of metrics do you guys watch internally that would maybe signal to you, maybe a softening of demand, whether it be Pro or DIY relative to trend? Are there any categories? Are there any behaviors? I know you're watching it constantly. But just curious kind of what you have your eyes on as you kind of navigate this volatile environment. \nMarvin Ellison: Look, as you can imagine, there are quite a few things that we look at. And I think the thing that I'm most pleased with, when I look around the table of my team is there's a lot of experience, a lot of people who live through quite a few different iterations of macro slowdowns in the home improvement space. So we have some pretty effective playbooks on the merchandising side, on the store operations side, on managing cost and inventory. I think it's one of the reasons why we've demonstrated quite a bit of agility in some of these unique times. Having said that, I'll let Brandon give you a little bit of the things that we look at just to make sure that we have our finger on the pause of the health of the business. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Peter, I would just call out just in this dynamic environment, I think really important for us to look at unit trends in particular. So between the merchant teams, the finance teams, week in, week out, we're down at a very detailed category assortment level. We're looking at 1-, 2- and 3-year trends and what -- how much of the business is being driven by inflation, ticket, the offset, how much we're driving in terms of units and demand. We've mentioned some of these categories in seasonal where we've seen units get back to pre-pandemic levels. We talked about patio and grills. \n So starting to understand and get comfortable and the flip side is we're seeing great unit growth in other areas like the Pro business that we want to continue to feed. So looking across the assortment, looking at those impacts, how that impacts inventory replenishment ordering and the drivers of the business teams are really focused on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: I wanted to start with the Pro. So, Marvin or Joe, you mentioned Lowe's MVP loyalty program, and I realize it's new, but curious if you can note what tier the majority of Pros sit in today and whether you saw any sort of early signs of Pros tiering up during the quarter as we look out to the back half? \nMarvin Ellison: Steve, so let me just -- I'm not going to answer that question specifically, let me say that first. So but I'll give you just some thoughts on the Pro loyalty program. We talked about the 13% comp growth in Pro and 37% growth on a 2-year basis. And we think that the foundation of what's driving that is really monetizing the investments we've already made from a service, staffing and technology. \n I think the second reason why you're seeing growth is the investments in brand that Bill talked about in his prepared comments and that's an ongoing process. Fulfillment is improved as a third kind of component of improvement. And we know that we have work to do to continue to make fulfillment easier for our Pro customers. And that's one of the things that, as I mentioned, that we're piloting a fulfillment center gig network, and we're excited about the possibilities. \n And then the last foundational point is what you asked is loyalty. And we think our new MVP program is incredibly successful in the early stages. And so how do I define that? Customers that are engaged in Pro loyalty and credit spend 3x more than Pros that don't. I mean, to me, that's the key metric that we look at. Do we understand the level of Pros that's tiering up we do, we don't want to discuss that externally. But what I will tell you is all the events that we've launched this year, leveraging points and Pro loyalty have exceeded our expectations, and we have a lot more to come. And we'll provide some level of granularity in the future, but it's too early to share it externally, but I will tell you that we're pleased with the progress. \nSteven Forbes: I appreciate the color, Marvin. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Brandon. Based on the gross margin guidance, it sort of implies a relatively flattish outlook for the back half. Clearly, we got the supply chain build-out and transportation cost pressure. So maybe there's any help on the offset if it's from mix or just product margin strength? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. We have -- we feel like we have a pretty good handle on the gross margin drivers of the business here over the second half. We expect modest product margin improvement, as you mentioned, offset by higher supply chain costs. That's inclusive of distribution, transportation. We mentioned the drag in Q2 and the expanded network. Shrink credit, fairly neutral as we look across the second half as it relates to other contributors to margin. So full year unchanged as it relates to guiding to slightly up from a gross margin standpoint. We feel really, really good about our ability to deliver that. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. \nScot Ciccarelli: So another DIY question. I know you bounced around this a little bit, but we -- the cycling of stimulus, the short spring season, that all makes sense as reasons why DIY would be negative. And I know this is an opinion, but I guess the question is, what gives you confidence that the softer trends you've seen in DIY over the last few months, isn't the beginning of the slowdown following several years of accelerated demand? \nMarvin Ellison: It's a fair question. So, Scot, I'll take the first part, and I'll let Brandon provide some context. So when you look at DIY and you look at the first half, I think it's important to understand that a lot of the negative impacts have been relatively isolated in discretionary categories. We talked a lot about patio and grills. But candidly, for the last 2 or 3 years with the lack of mobility that we've all had and the amount of time we spend at home, once you make an investment for patio furniture and grill is really not an overriding demand to do it again a year or 2 later, and we understand that.\n And also, we talked quite a bit about the shortened weather season of spring and how that put a lot of pressure on lawn and garden outside categories, and that's almost exclusively for us, DIY-specific. So when we try to put in characterization, what drove the DIY slowness in the first half, we can be very specific on that. But as we look at the back half, we know that a shift is coming based on our business trends. And I'll let Brandon just provide a little context on the trends we are seeing. And when we look to the interior of the store, what we believe will happen in the back half of the year. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. So, Scot, I think confidence, just given the first half isolated impacts that Marvin called out around the weather, the DIY discretionary, I mentioned earlier just momentum that we're seeing in the business, in particular, post-July 4 and again, looking at 1-year and 3-year comps, clear step-change that we're seeing in the business there. And then I think last, just as we look at the second half and really the structural sort of setup of the business, it's less seasonal. It's definitely interior-focused as we get into the core categories. And we think that, just coupled with the momentum, again, that we're seeing with the Pro, we feel like that plays really well when we look at the second half outlook that we have on the business. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes, Scot, just add one thing to that. So in a recessionary environment, as you look at the DIY, that tends to shift more to the repair categories versus the big ticket. And so there's a lot of indicators out there that we watch on a very regular basis. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: You lowered the comp outlook to the lower end of the range, but articulated the view that your earnings will be at the high end of the range, how low could your comps be in the back half of the year and you still hit the EPS guidance for the full year? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. So, Michael, this is Brandon. I would just tell you, we're very focused on delivering what the most likely scenario that we have with the business, which is updated in our outlook. So we're looking at top line being down 1%. We're really confident given the ability to manage gross margin, the step-up that we're seeing with SG&A leverage and how that's translating to profit expansion and EPS. Confident in that scenario, confident delivering on what we have in the guide. And that's where we are at this point in time. \nMarvin Ellison: And Michael, this is Marvin. The thing that we often talk about internally is that expense is typically relative to sales and expense as a percent of sales and percent of revenue. And so we have proven that we have levers that we can pull so that we can ensure that as revenue goes down, then we can, at the same point, bring our rate of expense down. And that's something that we feel very confident in our ability to deliver upon. And I think Q1 and Q2 of this year should represent that. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. And my follow-up question is on the nature of where sales stands today versus where they were in 2019. Marvin called out patio furniture and grills as categories that have been well above the trend line in demand. Seasonal and outdoor is about 20 -- excuse me, 10% of the business. Appliances and Other 10% to 15% of the business. Is that the right way to think about the risk of those sales being kind of over-earning from the last couple of years? And how much risk is there that this above trend performance in those categories start to leak into other areas of the business, lighting, flooring, other areas that could be more episodic in nature? \nMarvin Ellison: Michael, it's a really good question. I think you can appreciate that this has been one of the most difficult environments to forecast and to build any kind of consistent modeling on. So what I will say to you is we pay close attention to all the trends, and we are obviously now looking at what we call pre-pandemic sale rates and understanding where we have reverted back by category to those pre-pandemic levels. And so we know where we are and what categories are in those specific run rates, and we know which categories are not. \n And our job is to pay really close attention to those merchandising categories to ensure that we're in a good insight position, that we have good presentation, that were priced right. And that's our best attempt to try to manage it. We'll have a much better answer for you as we wrap up the kind of the back end of the year. Because of the uniqueness of these overlaps, it's really tough to answer that question with any precision just coming out of the second quarter. \nMichael Lasser: Understood. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. \nEric Bosshard: Curious for your strategy in regards to promotions and pricing as we move into the back half, considering what you're seeing with units and where you sit with inventory if you're changing relative to the first half. \nMarvin Ellison: Eric, this is Marvin. Short answer is no plans to change any of our philosophical approach to promotions and pricing. Our key is to be competitive. And again, we've invested in some sophisticated tools that give us real-time visibility to our competitors so we can be price right every single day. I'll let Bill talk more about his thoughts on promotion and pricing just to reinforce that we have a consistent philosophy that we plan to stick with. \nWilliam Boltz: Eric, thanks for the question. Just a couple of things and just a couple of reminders. We've been on this journey for our merchandising strategy, pricing strategy over really the last 3-plus years. And that has the playbook that we're working to follow and really trying to unwind from what was a high-low pricing strategy to an everyday competitive price strategy. And so the work that we've done between the merchants, the finance team to prop up, the resources to manage and monitor price on a daily, weekly basis is really allowing us to do that. And we feel really good about being very competitive, good line of sight on those key SKUs that matter. \n And then from a promotion perspective, it's all about being there when the customer expects us to be there. So obviously, we've got Labor Day event coming up here in the next couple of weeks. You go into the holiday season, Black Friday. And so we'll continue to supplement those events with key offers and be there with value for the customer and then work really hard to provide that value day in and day out in the store with the changes that we've made through our end cap strategies, flex strategies, et cetera. \nEric Bosshard: Just a follow-up within that. What have you seen when you have run events, you ran some July 4 events. And I'm just curious, have you seen different consumer engagement with promotions in this environment? Or now relative to the past, are these resonating? Again, I'm just asking, as you look at negative units and a bit softer sales and a bit more inventory. Historically, you promote more, I understand the new Lowe's is less focused on that. But is the payback from those things similar or different? Is the consumer responding similar, different on those? \nWilliam Boltz: Yes, I think there's a couple of things. There's -- first, there's a time and an opportunity to put stuff on value. And so if you think about first half of the year and you think about mulch and live goods promotions and those types of things that get the customer in the door and drive traffic, they play a certain role for us in the role of the category of certain merchandising businesses. And then you have new and innovation, as I said in my prepared remarks, where the customer is finding value in that. \n And a good example is that EGO lawnmower that I talked about in my opening remarks, it's a $700 unit, and it was by far one of our best-selling products, best unit driving products in the assortment. So it's not low priced. It's not on promotion, and it was just out there and the consumer has adopted that battery platform, and they love the product. So it's really a combination of both, and that's the blend that we're trying to manage. And in the appliance business, as you know, hundreds of thousands of appliances break every day. So you've got to be out there with an offer in the appliance business day in and day out. So that's how we're playing it. \nMarvin Ellison: Eric, this is Marvin. And I really appreciate the question because we're in this unique environment with customer demand, especially coming out of that outsized demand in certain discretionary categories during the pandemic. So we are closely monitoring any of our -- we call it, Tier 1 holiday promotions just to see our customers respond. The biggest difference at Lowe's today versus when I arrived about 4 years ago is that there is a rigorous analytical process that we go to coming out of all types of promotions just to look at, did we get the return on investment. \n And so what we're not going to do, to Bill's point, is just kind of follow historical trends just because we're going to evaluate whether or not we got a return when the customer responded and we'll adjust accordingly. And we've been doing quite a bit of adjusting because the customers are responding differently because this is such a unique environment. But as I said earlier, we're anxious now look at the back half of the year, we feel good about the trends as Brandon outlined. \n We feel good about how the customer is shifting on the interior parts of the store because that's where we're really strong and we feel we're well positioned. And we'll have a much better assessment looking at the full year going into next year relative to some of these customer engagement to some of these events. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So my first question is also a follow-up on the DIY side. Marvin, there were some headlines that talked about the improvement continuing into August and Brandon's comments certainly echo that. Have you seen DIY flip to a positive trend? And then as a follow-up, last year, post-Labor Day, you talked about that consumer coming back from sort of vacation and reengaging in DIY. So how are you thinking about the ability for that to sustain -- what you're seeing now to sustain against the step-up you saw last year? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, I'll repeat what Brandon said. We've seen a step change post-July 4 in our business, and that continues into the month of August. But it's early, but early means that the trends that we anticipated, we're seeing those trends, and we're seeing even better than we anticipated in certain categories. So that's a good news. But I'll just let Brandon kind of reiterate why we have confidence in the DIY consumer as we look at the back part of the year. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Chris, I'm not going to get into too much detail just specifically on DIY comps. But I would say just a response, as I mentioned over the last 6 weeks, especially as we've moved more to the interior of the core, the DIY business within the home decor categories, I think, has been notable, and that's where we're seeing momentum. And then I'd also just call out there's other areas, lumber is going to be a mix between Pro and DIY, but sort of just given where pricing is at that point, too, we're seeing nice response there, and we're seeing activity that we continue to see momentum building as we get into August here. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then some of the commodities of -- some of the input commodities for a lot of your products have come down recently. You've -- Marvin, since you came on board, you've introduced some very sophisticated pricing and cost deconstructing capabilities. How are you thinking about your intent in the near term to go back at the vendors from -- for some price rollbacks? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, before Brandon was elevated to his more prestigious position, he did that work for us in merchandising with Bill. So I'll let him give you some specifics on that. \nBrandon Sink: Thanks, Marvin. So, yes, Chris, I would say, just given rate tightening that we're seeing from the Fed, monitoring the commodity markets, we're definitely expecting some normalization as we move across the second half and into next year. We have built as Marvin has mentioned, the disciplined product cost management process. We feel like we have the insights to the cost drivers across our suppliers. We understand where it's coming from in terms of commodities, labor, transportation. \n And as raw materials down, we're positioned and prepared to renegotiate prices with our suppliers. We're actually very much underway in certain areas with Bill and his team. And then from a pricing perspective, like we always do, we're going to leverage a portfolio approach if and when we call back the dollars, but we're always going to ensure that we're going to be competitive there as we approach pricing. \nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: Maybe a follow-up. I did want to question the Pro business a little bit and 2 questions. One, Pro business, up double digits for Pro, that's great, but it did slow a little bit from last quarter on a 1-year and a 2-year basis. So wondering what to make of that. And then these comments on this being a little bit better. I guess DIY, but any comment on how the Pro business is doing in the last 6 weeks or so? \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. Thanks, Mike. This is Marvin. We feel good about the overall sales volume in the Pro business. And as Joe noted, second quarter is typically our highest DIY penetrating quarter of the year. But when we look at the Pro business, we feel incredibly positive on the momentum and just the daily volume we're seeing across all geographies relative to what we were seeing 2 or 3 years ago. And we think it's very sustainable than it's proven to be. \n And we think as we get into the back half of the year with our new Pro loyalty program, with improved job-like quantity in stocks with some of the brands that Bill outlined that we're going to see this momentum continue. And as I said, it's not just about Pro loyalty, Pro loyalty is one of the foundational pieces of the strategy in addition to all the investments we've made in the store, the brands, the fulfillment improvement. \n And also, just as a reminder, our U.S. reset project last year, literally improved all the adjacencies, specifically for the Pro customer, and we think those things are paying dividends. So that business is performing really well and is performing really well vis-a-vis the DIY and the same trends we're seeing post-July 4 for DIY. Pro is also taking those same positive trends and performing well. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Lowe's second quarter 2022 earnings call. You may now disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Brandon Sink",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Let me begin with our Q2 results. We delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.67, an increase of 9.9% compared to prior year as we drove productivity in a dynamic operating environment. Q2 sales were $27.5 billion, with comparable sales down 0.3%. Comparable average ticket increased 6.1% as higher Pro sales and product inflation drove higher average ticket. This was offset by comp transactions declining 6.4% as we cycle over 2 years of outsized growth in DIY sales. \n Comp transactions improved over 650 basis points sequentially from Q1. U.S. comp sales were up 0.2% in the quarter. Our sales were impacted by the shortened spring season, lower demand in certain DIY discretionary categories and lower-than-expected lumber prices. This was partially offset by a 13% increase in Pro customer sales. On Lowes.com, sales increased 7% in the quarter. \n Our U.S. monthly comps were down 1.5% in May, up 0.9% in June and up 1.1% in July. Gross margin was 33.24% of sales in the second quarter, down 54 basis points from last year. This is consistent with the expectations that we discussed in May. As expected, product margin rate was down 35 basis points versus the prior year. \n Lumber prices declined significantly from late April through mid-June. As we sold through our higher-cost inventory layers, product margin rate was pressured. Higher transportation costs, both import and domestic as well as the expansion of our supply chain network, also drove 35 basis points of pressure. Additionally, we experienced 10 basis points of shrink pressure largely due to live goods damaged by unseasonable weather. \n These impacts were partly offset by 30 basis points related to more favorable product mix. Despite the product cost pressures in the quarter, gross margin for the first half was up slightly compared to the first half of 2021. This reflected our ability to effectively navigate a volatile lumber market over the first half of the year as well as product cost inflation. I'm very pleased with the strong cross-functional collaboration from the teams as well as our diligent planning efforts. \n SG&A of 16.22% levered 80 basis points relative to Q2 2021. We drove substantial productivity across the enterprise in the quarter against slightly lower sales. Operating profit was $4.2 billion, up slightly versus the prior year. Operating margin rate of 15.39% of sales levered 12 basis points as SG&A leverage was partly offset by lower gross margin rate. The effective tax rate was 24.5%, in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $19.3 billion, up $2 billion or 11.6% from Q2 last year driven by product cost inflation of 15%, while units were down low single digits. \n This morning, we are affirming our full year 2022 financial outlook. We now expect that our 2022 sales will be near the bottom of our range of approximately $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales towards the bottom end of the range of down 1% to up 1% for the year. This reflects our first half results and our second half expectations of continued Pro momentum and improving DIY sales trends. We continue to expect Pro to outperform DIY for the remainder of the year. \n As a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We continue to expect gross margin rate to be up slightly as compared to the prior year. \n Given our better-than-expected flow-through in the first half, we now expect operating margin to be at the top end of our range of 12.8% to 13% for the full year. Our ability to lever gross margin and SG&A despite lower-than-expected sales reflects the company's focus, hard work and effective investments over the last several years. Taking all of this into consideration, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year to be at the top end of the range of $13.10 to $13.60. \n At Lowe's, we remain committed to our best-in-class capital allocation strategy. For 2022, we continue to expect approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures and $12 billion in share repurchases. Finally, we are affirming our outlook of return on invested capital above 36% for the year. \n Turning to our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy. In Q2, the company generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow. And through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.5 billion to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 21.6 million shares for $4 billion. We also paid $524 million in dividends at $0.80 per share and we announced a 31% increase to $1.05 per share in support of our 35% target dividend payout ratio. \n Capital expenditures totaled $344 million in the quarter as we invest in the business to support our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to make progress towards our target of 2.75x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR, ending the quarter at 2.23x, and we remain committed to maintaining our BBB+ rating. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 34.5% in the quarter, up 548 basis points versus last year. \n As I look ahead, I'm highly confident that we are making the right investments in our people and capabilities to support our business and drive meaningful long-term shareholder value. And with that, we will open it up for questions. Yes. So, Simeon, this is Brandon. Just as we look at DIY specifically, the business was heavily weighted to DIY seasonal in the first half of the year, I think, underperformed a bit just due to the weather, the pull forward that we mentioned in patio and grills. Second half of the year, transitioning more to the core the interior of the store. And in particular, post-July 4, over the last 6 weeks, we've seen continued momentum building in these categories. \n We've seen a clear step-change in the business, 1- to 3-year comps improving, again, in particular, in Pro and core interior. And then I'll point back to transactions, Q1, Simeon, down 13. We saw improvement in Q2 down 6. So we like the momentum we're seeing and optimistic around the step-changes again that we're seeing in the second half. Kate, this is Brandon. The only thing I would add in the prepared remarks, we talked about units being down. I think it has allowed us to make the needed investments, in particular, in the Pro space as we've seen momentum there. To continue to support demand, we've had improved in-stocks and in certain areas that we struggled a bit through the pandemic. So as Marvin said, really pleased where we are from an inventory position. \n We're managing seasonal, just like we would every year. In-stock levels are better than they've been here over the last 2.5 years. And any expected exit of seasonal fully included in the margin expectations that we have for second half. Yes, Peter, I would just call out just in this dynamic environment, I think really important for us to look at unit trends in particular. So between the merchant teams, the finance teams, week in, week out, we're down at a very detailed category assortment level. We're looking at 1-, 2- and 3-year trends and what -- how much of the business is being driven by inflation, ticket, the offset, how much we're driving in terms of units and demand. We've mentioned some of these categories in seasonal where we've seen units get back to pre-pandemic levels. We talked about patio and grills. \n So starting to understand and get comfortable and the flip side is we're seeing great unit growth in other areas like the Pro business that we want to continue to feed. So looking across the assortment, looking at those impacts, how that impacts inventory replenishment ordering and the drivers of the business teams are really focused on that. Yes. We have -- we feel like we have a pretty good handle on the gross margin drivers of the business here over the second half. We expect modest product margin improvement, as you mentioned, offset by higher supply chain costs. That's inclusive of distribution, transportation. We mentioned the drag in Q2 and the expanded network. Shrink credit, fairly neutral as we look across the second half as it relates to other contributors to margin. So full year unchanged as it relates to guiding to slightly up from a gross margin standpoint. We feel really, really good about our ability to deliver that. Yes. So, Scot, I think confidence, just given the first half isolated impacts that Marvin called out around the weather, the DIY discretionary, I mentioned earlier just momentum that we're seeing in the business, in particular, post-July 4 and again, looking at 1-year and 3-year comps, clear step-change that we're seeing in the business there. And then I think last, just as we look at the second half and really the structural sort of setup of the business, it's less seasonal. It's definitely interior-focused as we get into the core categories. And we think that, just coupled with the momentum, again, that we're seeing with the Pro, we feel like that plays really well when we look at the second half outlook that we have on the business. Yes. So, Michael, this is Brandon. I would just tell you, we're very focused on delivering what the most likely scenario that we have with the business, which is updated in our outlook. So we're looking at top line being down 1%. We're really confident given the ability to manage gross margin, the step-up that we're seeing with SG&A leverage and how that's translating to profit expansion and EPS. Confident in that scenario, confident delivering on what we have in the guide. And that's where we are at this point in time. Yes, Chris, I'm not going to get into too much detail just specifically on DIY comps. But I would say just a response, as I mentioned over the last 6 weeks, especially as we've moved more to the interior of the core, the DIY business within the home decor categories, I think, has been notable, and that's where we're seeing momentum. And then I'd also just call out there's other areas, lumber is going to be a mix between Pro and DIY, but sort of just given where pricing is at that point, too, we're seeing nice response there, and we're seeing activity that we continue to see momentum building as we get into August here. Thanks, Marvin. So, yes, Chris, I would say, just given rate tightening that we're seeing from the Fed, monitoring the commodity markets, we're definitely expecting some normalization as we move across the second half and into next year. We have built as Marvin has mentioned, the disciplined product cost management process. We feel like we have the insights to the cost drivers across our suppliers. We understand where it's coming from in terms of commodities, labor, transportation. \n And as raw materials down, we're positioned and prepared to renegotiate prices with our suppliers. We're actually very much underway in certain areas with Bill and his team. And then from a pricing perspective, like we always do, we're going to leverage a portfolio approach if and when we call back the dollars, but we're always going to ensure that we're going to be competitive there as we approach pricing."

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone.  In the second quarter, our total company comparable sales declined 0.3%, while U.S. comps increased 0.2%. For the quarter, Pro sales remained strong. In fact, this is the ninth consecutive quarter that we've driven double-digit Pro growth. As a reminder, at Lowe's, 75% of our sales are driven by the DIY customer while 25% of our sales is from the Pro. And while underlying home improvement trends remain strong, our DIY sales were lower than expected in the second quarter and the first half of the year.  \n As I mentioned on our previous call, the timing of spring disproportionately impacts DIY sales as many seasonal categories like lawn and garden are heavily concentrated in DIY. In addition to spring arriving late, it also ended early, quickly moving from a cold winter to a hot summer in some regions. This showed in the planting season and pressured lawn and garden sales.  \n Also, while we plan for a modest sector pullback this year as we lap outsized DIY consumer demand, we now believe that certain categories like patio and grills are disproportionately impacted by the unprecedented demand from 2020 and 2021. This unprecedented demand was likely fueled by the combination of 3 rounds of government stimulus, an increase in consumer savings rate and a temporary shift away from spending on services towards spending on goods, including home improvement products. These factors drove more discretionary purchases over the past 2 years than it was possible to precisely measure at the time.  \n And some of you have asked whether we're seeing consumers trade down in their purchase activity. At this point, we are not seeing indications of material trade down. If anything, we're seeing the opposite with continued strong demand for our new and innovative products at higher price points. Bill will provide more context on our customer spending trends later in the call.  \n To summarize, our DIY trends, despite slower sales in select discretionary categories like patios and grills, the DIY customer remains resilient, which reflects continued strong home improvement demand trends.  \n Now turning to Pro. We continue to outperform the market, delivering growth of 13% and 37% on a 2-year basis. We're particularly pleased with the momentum we're seeing with our Pro loyalty program, MVP's Pro Rewards, which is designed to make every Pro feel like an MVP regardless of the size of their business. Because time is money for Pros, one of the most valuable ways that we can serve them is by saving them time with enhanced fulfillment. Therefore, we are actively piloting convenient fulfillment options, including a new Pro fulfillment center in Charlotte, and gig network solutions that offer same-day delivery for both Pro and DIY. Joe will provide a further update on our strategic initiatives to improve Pro penetration later on the call.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 7% this quarter, representing a sales penetration of nearly 10%. We're continuing to invest in omnichannel capabilities because we believe there is still tremendous runway for further growth ahead. In Canada, Q2 performance lagged the U.S. And as a reminder, because our Canadian business is more heavily weighted towards lumber, it disproportionately benefited from record high lumber prices last year.  \n Let me now discuss our operating performance for the second quarter. I'm particularly pleased with the operating discipline that we've developed across our business, which is demonstrated by our ability to improve operating margin once again despite lower sales. During the quarter, operating margin expanded 12 basis points, and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $4.67, which is an increase of nearly 10% versus last year. The progress also reflects our team's disciplined focus on our perpetual productivity initiatives or PPI. Not only did PPI support our first half operating margin improvement, it will also help to drive operating leverage for the balance of the year and for the next several years. Joe will discuss the success of our PPI initiatives in more detail later in the call.  \n Now I'd like to address some concerns that I've heard from our shareholders about the home improvement market. I want to begin by clarifying that the market dynamics that pressure the home builder are not necessarily the same market dynamics that pressure the home improvement retailer. At Lowe's, the 3 highest correlating factors of home improvement demand are home price appreciation, the age of the housing stock and disposable personal income. While housing turnover is important, it does not index at the same rate as home price appreciation, housing age and disposable personal income.  \n And while we acknowledge that housing turnover has slowed, home prices and home equity remains at record highs, which gives customers confidence that they will get a return on the investment that they make in their homes. And also importantly, those homes keep getting older. More than half of the homes in the U.S. are over 40 years old and millions more built at the peak of the housing boom in the early 2000s are now starting to turn 20 years old, which is a key inflection point for big-ticket repairs.  \n In terms of disposable personal income, household wealth is still at an all-time high. Consumer savings are roughly $2.6 trillion higher than they were pre-pandemic. And 75% of that excess savings is concentrated in middle- and high-income households who are more likely to be homeowners, which highlights another key benefit of our industry, our core customer is the homeowner.  \n In addition to having significantly more disposable income, most homeowners are benefiting from lower fixed mortgage rates. And as low housing supply and high interest rates make moving less desirable, homeowners are motivated to invest in their current homes to fit their needs. This is one of the key reasons that home improvement can win in markets when housing turnover is strong and when it slows as we saw in the mid-1990s when home improvement spend grew despite rising interest rates and a slowdown in housing turnover.  \n Now shifting to trends in Pro. We continuously survey our Pros and their confidence in their job prospects is the highest it's been in years. The Pro is busier than ever, and the strength of the Pro backlog speaks to the significant pent-up demand for their services. In short, we are fortunate to operate in this retail sector and despite the macro uncertainty and unprecedented seasonal demand in the past 2 years, our long-term outlook for the home improvement industry and the Pro customer remains positive.  \n As I close, I would like to personally thank our associates for their hard work and dedication. In recognition of some of the cost pressures they are facing due to high inflation, we are providing an incremental $55 million in bonuses to our hourly frontline associates this quarter. These associates have the most important jobs in our company, and we deeply appreciate everything they do to serve our customers to deliver a best-in-class experience.  \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Simeon, this is Marvin. I think it's important to note that when you look at the first half of the year, the first half is obviously more seasonal. And so we had weather impacts that drove a lot of our negative units, if you think about outdoor lawn and garden, chemicals, et cetera. And then if you think about what we talked about the unprecedented demand we saw in the last couple of years in some of these DIY discretionary categories, specifically, patio and grills. We're not going to experience the seasonality of the business in the second half of the year, and we're not going to experience that unprecedented overlap in those 2 highly seasonal discretionary categories. Simeon, it's a really good question. I think it depends on the financial category. So I'll remind you that home improvement is a $900 billion marketplace. And I think it's easy to just focus on the 2 largest players and determine the overall market share gain just based on that, but this is a really fragmented marketplace. So on the revenue side, we absolutely believe that we have an incredible wrong way to continue to grow, just focus specifically on the fact that our Pro penetration is hovering around 23% to 25%. And we know we can get that number significantly higher. \n Now the good news is, as Joe mentioned, is increased 500 basis points since 2019. So on the sales revenue side, we think we have an incredible opportunity to continue to grow. On operating margin, I mean, we said consistently that 12% was not a plateau. It was a baseline. Now we're going to say the same thing about 13%. We think when we hit that plateau, it's just going to be another baseline that we can continue to grow from. Joe talked about the importance of our PPI initiatives that is not a static list, but this is something that we see benefit in future quarters and candidly future years. So in both those areas, we think that we have room to grow, and we look forward to providing a very detailed outlook at the December conference. So, Kate, I'll take the first part of that, and I'll let Brandon and Bill jump in. I would say, first and foremost, I am extremely pleased with the disciplined collaboration and planning that's taken place to put us in a really good inventory position vis-a-vis the retail industry. Any time you could have units declining in this environment with supply chain constraints and just incredible difficulties in forecasting, it points to a lot of hard work. \n So the headline is we feel really good about our current inventory position, and we feel good about our in-stock position in the second half of the year versus last year. So I'm going to let Brandon talk a little bit about the financial expression and I'll let Bill talk about where we are and where we feel like that we're in a much better position versus what we've been in past years and past quarters. Peter, it's a really good question. Obviously, we pay very close attention to what we describe as service levels versus as task levels. And the thing that Joe and the store operators have done an incredible job is investing in service while taking hours away from tasks. So when you see that SG&A leverage, it's not like the old days where you just kind of rip payroll out and you risk service. \n What Joe and his team have done a masterful job of is pulling hours away from non-customer-facing parts of the store, taking some of those dollars to the bottom line, but then reinvesting dollars on the service side. So I'll let Joe give you some specifics. But the headline is likelihood to recommend up for both DIY and Pro in the quarter with SG&A leverage, and that is not easy to do. So, Joe, you could provide some detail. Look, as you can imagine, there are quite a few things that we look at. And I think the thing that I'm most pleased with, when I look around the table of my team is there's a lot of experience, a lot of people who live through quite a few different iterations of macro slowdowns in the home improvement space. So we have some pretty effective playbooks on the merchandising side, on the store operations side, on managing cost and inventory. I think it's one of the reasons why we've demonstrated quite a bit of agility in some of these unique times. Having said that, I'll let Brandon give you a little bit of the things that we look at just to make sure that we have our finger on the pause of the health of the business. Steve, so let me just -- I'm not going to answer that question specifically, let me say that first. So but I'll give you just some thoughts on the Pro loyalty program. We talked about the 13% comp growth in Pro and 37% growth on a 2-year basis. And we think that the foundation of what's driving that is really monetizing the investments we've already made from a service, staffing and technology. \n I think the second reason why you're seeing growth is the investments in brand that Bill talked about in his prepared comments and that's an ongoing process. Fulfillment is improved as a third kind of component of improvement. And we know that we have work to do to continue to make fulfillment easier for our Pro customers. And that's one of the things that, as I mentioned, that we're piloting a fulfillment center gig network, and we're excited about the possibilities. \n And then the last foundational point is what you asked is loyalty. And we think our new MVP program is incredibly successful in the early stages. And so how do I define that? Customers that are engaged in Pro loyalty and credit spend 3x more than Pros that don't. I mean, to me, that's the key metric that we look at. Do we understand the level of Pros that's tiering up we do, we don't want to discuss that externally. But what I will tell you is all the events that we've launched this year, leveraging points and Pro loyalty have exceeded our expectations, and we have a lot more to come. And we'll provide some level of granularity in the future, but it's too early to share it externally, but I will tell you that we're pleased with the progress. It's a fair question. So, Scot, I'll take the first part, and I'll let Brandon provide some context. So when you look at DIY and you look at the first half, I think it's important to understand that a lot of the negative impacts have been relatively isolated in discretionary categories. We talked a lot about patio and grills. But candidly, for the last 2 or 3 years with the lack of mobility that we've all had and the amount of time we spend at home, once you make an investment for patio furniture and grill is really not an overriding demand to do it again a year or 2 later, and we understand that.\n And also, we talked quite a bit about the shortened weather season of spring and how that put a lot of pressure on lawn and garden outside categories, and that's almost exclusively for us, DIY-specific. So when we try to put in characterization, what drove the DIY slowness in the first half, we can be very specific on that. But as we look at the back half, we know that a shift is coming based on our business trends. And I'll let Brandon just provide a little context on the trends we are seeing. And when we look to the interior of the store, what we believe will happen in the back half of the year. And Michael, this is Marvin. The thing that we often talk about internally is that expense is typically relative to sales and expense as a percent of sales and percent of revenue. And so we have proven that we have levers that we can pull so that we can ensure that as revenue goes down, then we can, at the same point, bring our rate of expense down. And that's something that we feel very confident in our ability to deliver upon. And I think Q1 and Q2 of this year should represent that. Michael, it's a really good question. I think you can appreciate that this has been one of the most difficult environments to forecast and to build any kind of consistent modeling on. So what I will say to you is we pay close attention to all the trends, and we are obviously now looking at what we call pre-pandemic sale rates and understanding where we have reverted back by category to those pre-pandemic levels. And so we know where we are and what categories are in those specific run rates, and we know which categories are not. \n And our job is to pay really close attention to those merchandising categories to ensure that we're in a good insight position, that we have good presentation, that were priced right. And that's our best attempt to try to manage it. We'll have a much better answer for you as we wrap up the kind of the back end of the year. Because of the uniqueness of these overlaps, it's really tough to answer that question with any precision just coming out of the second quarter. Eric, this is Marvin. Short answer is no plans to change any of our philosophical approach to promotions and pricing. Our key is to be competitive. And again, we've invested in some sophisticated tools that give us real-time visibility to our competitors so we can be price right every single day. I'll let Bill talk more about his thoughts on promotion and pricing just to reinforce that we have a consistent philosophy that we plan to stick with. Eric, this is Marvin. And I really appreciate the question because we're in this unique environment with customer demand, especially coming out of that outsized demand in certain discretionary categories during the pandemic. So we are closely monitoring any of our -- we call it, Tier 1 holiday promotions just to see our customers respond. The biggest difference at Lowe's today versus when I arrived about 4 years ago is that there is a rigorous analytical process that we go to coming out of all types of promotions just to look at, did we get the return on investment. \n And so what we're not going to do, to Bill's point, is just kind of follow historical trends just because we're going to evaluate whether or not we got a return when the customer responded and we'll adjust accordingly. And we've been doing quite a bit of adjusting because the customers are responding differently because this is such a unique environment. But as I said earlier, we're anxious now look at the back half of the year, we feel good about the trends as Brandon outlined. \n We feel good about how the customer is shifting on the interior parts of the store because that's where we're really strong and we feel we're well positioned. And we'll have a much better assessment looking at the full year going into next year relative to some of these customer engagement to some of these events. Well, I'll repeat what Brandon said. We've seen a step change post-July 4 in our business, and that continues into the month of August. But it's early, but early means that the trends that we anticipated, we're seeing those trends, and we're seeing even better than we anticipated in certain categories. So that's a good news. But I'll just let Brandon kind of reiterate why we have confidence in the DIY consumer as we look at the back part of the year. Well, before Brandon was elevated to his more prestigious position, he did that work for us in merchandising with Bill. So I'll let him give you some specifics on that. Yes. Thanks, Mike. This is Marvin. We feel good about the overall sales volume in the Pro business. And as Joe noted, second quarter is typically our highest DIY penetrating quarter of the year. But when we look at the Pro business, we feel incredibly positive on the momentum and just the daily volume we're seeing across all geographies relative to what we were seeing 2 or 3 years ago. And we think it's very sustainable than it's proven to be. \n And we think as we get into the back half of the year with our new Pro loyalty program, with improved job-like quantity in stocks with some of the brands that Bill outlined that we're going to see this momentum continue. And as I said, it's not just about Pro loyalty, Pro loyalty is one of the foundational pieces of the strategy in addition to all the investments we've made in the store, the brands, the fulfillment improvement. \n And also, just as a reminder, our U.S. reset project last year, literally improved all the adjacencies, specifically for the Pro customer, and we think those things are paying dividends. So that business is performing really well and is performing really well vis-a-vis the DIY and the same trends we're seeing post-July 4 for DIY. Pro is also taking those same positive trends and performing well."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.  In the second quarter, U.S. comparable sales were up 0.2%. I'd like to walk you through the trends that we are seeing in the business, beginning with our DIY results. As Marvin mentioned, we had a short spring moving directly from winter to summer in many areas of the country, impacting demand for outdoor garden products like fertilizer, chemicals and live nursery. After 2 years of outsized growth in home-related sales, we plan for sales to slow in certain categories this year. And our disciplined planning process enabled us to mitigate many of the inventory pressures you're seeing across the retail industry.  \n But certain categories were still down more than expected, like patio furniture and outdoor grills, which is consistent with trends across the broader market. But even within patio, our newly designed Origin 21 items sold out first in most stores, like our exclusive Brennfield egg  chair that retailed at $628.  \n Another interesting trend from the quarter is the ongoing demand for innovation, reflecting underlying consumer strength. Rather than seeing trade down, in many cases, we are seeing customers trade up, spending more to purchase the latest technology like battery-powered products available in the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands. In fact, one of our top-performing products this quarter was an EGO 56-volt self-propelled mower that retailed for over $700. This unit dramatically outperformed our sales forecast despite being one of the most expensive battery mowers in our assortment, proven what we have said before that value doesn't have to be low priced.  \n In Refrigeration, we continue to see consumers trade up to higher-priced products in brands like KitchenAid, Samsung and LG, with features and benefits that serve a busy family's lifestyle. And while client sales were below our expectations, we continue to take incremental share and lead the market as the #1 appliance retailer in the U.S. We also continue to source new products that make projects easier for our DIY savvy customers, like our expanded STAINMASTER lineup, including laminate flooring, sheet vinyl and tile, which are getting overwhelmingly positive customer feedback due to how easy they are to install and keep clean. Or how about our new build-in Batten product, a Lowe's exclusive? This new pre-sized and miter molding makes it easy and cost-effective for the do-it-yourself or to do highly intricate designs like wanes coating.  \n And for the Pro, it saves them time on these jobs as well. Customers can transform a wall in a day for less than $300. And across the store and within each of our merchandising categories, we offer value at all price points and feature leading products from our all-star brands like  Trex, Owens Corning, John Deere, EGO, Honda, KitchenAid, Samsung, LG, Kohler, Moen, Whirlpool, Husqvarna and Aaron's.  \n Shifting gears now to our Pro customer, we delivered broad-based and strong results with positive comps across rough plumbing, building materials, paint, electrical, millwork and hardware. We are pleased with the traction that we are making with this important customer and we continue to optimize our Pro assortments to ensure we offer the products Pros need from the brands that they know and trust.  \n This quarter, we launched Eden Creek, a liquid additive that improves the quality, durability and sustainability of concrete projects. We also launched the new stack lithium battery technology in our line of FLEX cordless power tools, making Lowe's now the only destination to have this new battery technology available in both FLEX and DEWALT, which brings more power in a smaller package.  \n And in millwork, we also were the first to market with our own reliable stock exterior black trim vinyl window, an increasingly popular trend to give homes a more premium look, with some Pros even buying pallets of these products before they even hit our shelves. We also added JELD-WEN prefinished interior doors, which come pre-painted from the factory, saving Pros the time and expense required to paint the door. These additions have further strengthened our portfolio of trusted programs like Bosch, Crescent, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.\n In our lumber business, comps declined modestly as we cycled over record high prices in the previous year. However, unit volumes were up significantly year-over-year, which reflects the strong underlying project demand.  \n Turning now to Lowes.com, sales grew 7%, building on top of the tremendous growth we have seen over the past few years. We continue to invest in the online user experience by expanding and enhancing our assortments, building out and improving our visualizer and configurator tools, and enhancing the delivery experience to make it easier for our customers to track their orders.  \n As I close, I'd like to thank my entire merchandising team, along with our finance, inventory and supply chain teams for their disciplined inventory management and planning process in a complex retail environment. And lastly, I'd also like to thank our vendor partners for their continued partnership and hard work to ensure our customers have the products they need for every home improvement project they tackle.  \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. And Brandon, the only thing I would add is that the quality level of the inventory is good, although there are still categories across the store that we want to see improvements in. And so we're continuing to work with our vendor partners to do that, working with our supply chain teams in order to expedite that product to the store into the shelf and the teams are working on those. And -- but the quality level of inventory this year versus last year is dramatically better than it's been. Eric, thanks for the question. Just a couple of things and just a couple of reminders. We've been on this journey for our merchandising strategy, pricing strategy over really the last 3-plus years. And that has the playbook that we're working to follow and really trying to unwind from what was a high-low pricing strategy to an everyday competitive price strategy. And so the work that we've done between the merchants, the finance team to prop up, the resources to manage and monitor price on a daily, weekly basis is really allowing us to do that. And we feel really good about being very competitive, good line of sight on those key SKUs that matter. \n And then from a promotion perspective, it's all about being there when the customer expects us to be there. So obviously, we've got Labor Day event coming up here in the next couple of weeks. You go into the holiday season, Black Friday. And so we'll continue to supplement those events with key offers and be there with value for the customer and then work really hard to provide that value day in and day out in the store with the changes that we've made through our end cap strategies, flex strategies, et cetera. Yes, I think there's a couple of things. There's -- first, there's a time and an opportunity to put stuff on value. And so if you think about first half of the year and you think about mulch and live goods promotions and those types of things that get the customer in the door and drive traffic, they play a certain role for us in the role of the category of certain merchandising businesses. And then you have new and innovation, as I said in my prepared remarks, where the customer is finding value in that. \n And a good example is that EGO lawnmower that I talked about in my opening remarks, it's a $700 unit, and it was by far one of our best-selling products, best unit driving products in the assortment. So it's not low priced. It's not on promotion, and it was just out there and the consumer has adopted that battery platform, and they love the product. So it's really a combination of both, and that's the blend that we're trying to manage. And in the appliance business, as you know, hundreds of thousands of appliances break every day. So you've got to be out there with an offer in the appliance business day in and day out. So that's how we're playing it."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.  \n Let me begin by expressing my appreciation for our associates. They delivered strong customer service and profitability this quarter due to their commitment to our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. Over the first half of the year, we have made meaningful strides. I'd like to spend some time now discussing what we are focused on for the remainder of 2022, including how we continue to simplify our store processes.  \n Earlier this year, we launched what we call Project Simple in our stores, one of our many PPI initiatives with a focus on further reducing daily duplicative tasks that distract from customer service and drive needless expense. In fact, as we continue rolling out Project Simple, we expect that it will eliminate over 80 nonproductive hours per store per week in the second half.  \n In February, I discussed the launch of our game-changing, new store inventory management system, or SIMS. While we are just 6 months into the implementation, we are already seeing strong results. With the improved inventory visibility, we are reducing nonproductive hours the associates spend searching for product while also improving the customer shopping experience, in-store and online.  \n And in the second half, we will leverage SIMS for an exciting new feature, prescriptive pack down. This new process will provide specific downstocking instructions to our associates based on sell-through rates. So they know whether the product needs to go directly on to the shelf or the end cap bypassing the top stock altogether. This drives a more efficient, proactive replenishment and inventory planning process.  \n As these examples illustrate, PPI is not a static set of initiatives that will expire at a predetermined date. PPI's perpetual process of ongoing initiatives that will continue to deliver productivity, not only in the second half, but for many quarters to come.  \n Now shifting our focus to the Pro. We continue to deliver incredible results with Pro comps of over 13% in the quarter. In fact, this is the ninth quarter in a row that we have driven double-digit Pro comps. Even in a quarter that is traditionally our most DIY-heavy, we saw Pro penetration of over 23% in the U.S., an increase of over 500 basis points from 2019.  \n And we are further enhancing our Pro offering with our new MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program. This Pro loyalty program launched in the first quarter, and it continues to outperform our expectations.  \n In July, we launched MVP's Bonus Points in conjunction with our first-ever Lowe's MVP bonus days event with a focus on the products that Pros use every day. Pros earn extra bonus points on our leading brands such as DEWALT, Valspar, FLEX, Metabo, A.O. Smith and Frigidaire. Our Pros can redeem their points for other products or gift cards in the MVP Pro Reward Center. It is their choice, and we made it easy for all Pros to benefit.  \n As our MVP's Pro Rewards program continues to mature in the second half, we are excited to present our Pros with compelling offers that will be tailored just for them.  \n Before I close, let me discuss the investments that we are making in our most important asset, our associates, as we strive to become the employer of choice in retail. We recently announced expanded scheduling options for our full-time associates. Most full-time associates can now request a fixed 4-day work week, fixed days off or even choose their preferred shift providing them with predictability on their terms. This is a significant improvement in our associates' quality of life, and it is another way that we are differentiating ourselves from other retailers. \n As Marvin mentioned, to help our frontline hourly associates during this period of high inflation, we are awarding an incremental bonus of $55 million. Also for a designated time frame, we are providing our associates with an additional 10% discount on everyday household and cleaning items. Associates can now purchase these products at a 20% discount, which we hope will ease the burden of inflation impacting many of these items. We will continue to look for meaningful ways to improve our associates work-life balance, while providing them with the tools to build a career at Lowe's. I would like to thank our associates once again for their commitment to Lowe's and to our customers. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Brandon. Thanks, Marvin. And listen, I think it goes back to the focus that we've had on our associates. And again, with the PPI initiatives, we're moving unnecessary daunting tasks replacing them with technology and just enabling the associates' time on the floor to be more productive. We've done things, the flexible scheduling. We've talked many times in the past about our new labor management engine. And so as we continue moving forward, we measure every single day, every single week, and we're very pleased with the progress we've made both in the operational expense and the customer experience. Yes, Scot, just add one thing to that. So in a recessionary environment, as you look at the DIY, that tends to shift more to the repair categories versus the big ticket. And so there's a lot of indicators out there that we watch on a very regular basis."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Lowe's Companies' First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Kate. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website.  \n During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2022. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.  \n Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. \n Before we turn to our first quarter results, I would like to announce that we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor Conference in-person on Wednesday, December 7, from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time in New York City. For those of you who are unable to attend in-person, the event will also be live-streamed on video. At this event, our executive leadership team will provide updates on the key growth initiatives in our Total Home strategy and our long-term financial targets.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone.  \n In the first quarter, our total company comparable sales declined 4% with the U.S. comps down 3.8%. Excluding our seasonal category, sales were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. \n Looking at sales goals on a 2-year basis, total company comps and U.S. comps were up approximately 20%. In Pro, we delivered growth of 20% and 64% on a 2-year basis. We also saw solid DIY demand for core nonseasonal home improvement projects. However, we experienced a delayed spring selling season due to prolonged unfavorable weather that impacted spring-related categories.  \n In fact, to put this into historical context, the past April was the coldest in over 20 years and one of the wettest in recent memory. But now spring has finally arrived, and we are seeing the anticipated improvement in our seasonal sales in the month of May.  \n I would like to provide some perspective on the impact that a very delayed spring has on our do-it-yourself or DIY sales. As a reminder, roughly 75% of our sales are to the DIY consumer in many seasonal categories like live goods, outdoor power equipment, grills and patio furniture are more heavily concentrated in DIY. And while spring was delayed across all geographies, the season came particularly late in the north, where sales were down double digits in many of our northern markets. And at the same time, sales in our Florida, Charlotte, Nashville, Houston, Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond regions were ahead of our sales expectations, even though spring weather was unfavorable in those regions as well. Simply stated, the further north you look, the larger the negative impact to our seasonal categories.  \n Although the late spring postponed our DIY sales, our Pro customers continue to shop to fuel their strong business demand. And our recent Pro surveys indicate that the majority of our Pro customers continue to report strength in their business and a full slate of projects for the year. At Lowe's, we see spring as a first half event. And as I mentioned, we are encouraged by the improved sales trends we're seeing in the month of May. We're also ready to capitalize on the increased demand with our enhanced assortment, strong inventory position, improved supply chain capabilities and seasonal staffing in place to serve our customers. Later in the call, Bill will discuss our plans to win spring again this year, while Joe will discuss how we are serving our customers during this busy season.  \n Importantly, our Total Home strategy has given us the agility and flexibility to deliver operating margin improvement even when sales decline. During the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 65 basis points, leading to diluted earnings per share of $3.51, which is an increase of over 9% versus last year. These results reflect great operational discipline in addition to excellent execution in a number of key initiatives, including our enhanced labor management tools, our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives, and our improved pricing capabilities.  \n Our Total Home strategy also enabled us to win with both the Pro and DIY customer in Q1 as we elevate our product assortment and provide our customers with the products and brands that they need across all of their home improvement projects.  \n Let me now discuss the progress that we're making with our Pro customer. As I mentioned, we delivered Pro growth of 20% in the quarter on top of 36% comps last year. The progress with this very important customer is reflected in the nearly 600-basis-point increase in Pro sales penetration in the U.S. from approximately 19% in Q1 of 2019 to approximately 25% in 2022. Later in the call, Joe will discuss how we continue to drive growth in Pro with the early success of our Lowe's MVP's Pro Rewards and Partnership Program that was launched in the first quarter.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 2% on top of over 36% growth in the first quarter of 2021, which represents a 2-year comp of over 39% and nearly 10% sales penetration. As we enhance our omnichannel offering, we are gaining traction with consumers who increasingly expect a fully integrated shopping experience. We're also expanding our market delivery strategy by adding other big and bulky products in Florida including patio, grills and riding lawn mowers to the appliances that we already deliver from our cross-dock terminals. By adding these incremental products, we're better leveraging our fixed costs while enhancing customer service at the same time. We've also converted our fourth geographic area, the Tennessee, Kentucky region to this new delivery model. And we're on track to convert our full portfolio of stores to market delivery by the end of 2023.  \n Turning to our results in Canada where our performance lagged the U.S. in Q1. Last year, Canada's results benefited from record high lumber prices due to the higher lumber mix in our Canadian business.  \n In closing, despite some increased uncertainty in the macro environment, our long-term outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Homeowner balance sheets are very strong, and their confidence to purchase big-ticket items is supported by continuing home price appreciation. Other factors like the extension of remote work, the age of the housing stock, millennial household formation and baby boomers preference to age in place, all are long-term tailwinds for home improvement.  \n And over the past few years, we have greatly improved our operating capabilities so that we now have the agility needed to respond in this dynamic macro environment. These enhanced capabilities will allow us to continue to take market share while expanding our operating margin.  \n And as a reflection of Lowe's' commitment to the community, at the beginning of the year, we announced a new community impact program called Lowe's Hometowns. This is a 5-year $100 million investment to improve the communities in which we live and work and to ensure we remain committed to giving back to our customers.  \n And before I close, I would like to welcome Brandon Sink to his new role as EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Brandon brings tenure, home improvement expertise and strong financial and operational acumen to this role, and we're excited to have him on the executive leadership team. I would also like to take a moment to thank Dave Denton for the contribution he made as CFO in the past 3 years. \n And at Lowe's, we believe that our store associates are a competitive advantage, and I would like to close by thanking our frontline associates for their hard work and dedication.  \n And with that, I will turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.  \n In the first quarter, U.S. comparable sales declined 3.8%, but were up 19.7% on a 2-year basis. This quarter, we delivered a strong positive comp in building products, driven by our momentum with the Pro, while sales in home decor came in above our expectations driven by solid DIY demand. However, comps and hardlines were down compared to prior year as a delayed spring season impacted seasonal categories.  \n We are particularly pleased to see improved demand in seasonal categories over the past few weeks as the spring weather has finally arrived. In the quarter, 10 of 15 categories were above company average while 8 categories were up over 20% on a 2-year basis. Within our home decor division, paint and flooring delivered the strongest comps this quarter. Inside our paint category, the biggest growth drivers were in interior and exterior paint and primers as our in-stocks continue to improve throughout the quarter.  \n Also, our investments in our Pro Paint offering continue to pay off as we've enhanced our Pro service model, expanded associate training and have built out our job site delivery capabilities. We are building on this momentum with the recent launch of our new, incremental paint reward program for our MVPs Pro customers, in addition to the other meaningful rewards they have already received.  \n Within flooring, luxury vinyl was once again the top contributor as our consumers continue to prefer the low maintenance and stylish solutions that this product category has to offer. We also refreshed our STAINMASTER carpet lineup, continuing to reflect current styles and consumer preferences. And in late March, we launched our first extension of the STAINMASTER brand in tile. And right behind tile, we are launching new laminate and luxury vinyl products in STAINMASTER as well. We're excited to have the STAINMASTER brand within our portfolio and to extend its high-performance characteristics and stain-resistant warranty to these new product categories. With this new brand lineup, we are offering innovative and functional products for the home, all with a great value for our customers.  \n Now turning to building products. We continue to see broad-based strength across key Pro categories, including electrical, building materials, rough plumbing, millwork and lumber, driven by strong Pro demand and competitive in-stock positions. Building on last year's strong performance, we delivered a positive 38% 2-year comp in building products, which continues to reflect the persistent underlying strength in consumer demand for larger core home improvement projects and, to a lesser extent, commodity inflation.  \n Over the past several years, we have been focused on expanding our brand and product offerings to meet the needs of our Pro customers. In this quarter, we are excited about the introduction of Owens Corning new fiberglass rebar known as Pink bar. This Pro family product is stronger than traditional steel rebar and 7x lighter which makes it both easier for the Pro to work with and less costly to ship.  \n We are also excited to announce the national expansion of the APOC roof coating brand, which is a leading manufacturer in roofing and an important strategic partner to Lowe's. These new products and brands are strong additions to our outstanding Pro brand portfolio, which already includes other powerful brands like Bosch, Crescent, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.  \n Now looking at our performance in hardlines. As I mentioned earlier, our seasonal categories were impacted by delayed spring. As the weather has finally broken over the past few weeks, we have now seen higher demand across the seasonal categories. And it's important to remember that spring is always a first half event. And while this year's spring season has started slow, the teams are focused on delivering a successful spring again this year.  \n From the convenience and quality of the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands with their zero-emission rechargeable equipment to our other leading brands such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and CRAFTSMAN, we offer the products that our customers need to have the best-looking yard in the neighborhood. We are also continuing to expand our private brand lineup with new products in Origin 21, our new modern brand as well as our popular allen + roth brand, which is tailored to the more traditional taste.  \n SpringFest, which is our new approach to spring, is a multiweek event, and we leveraged several strategic promotions for popular spring items like mulch, soils and hanging baskets to deliver great value for our customers. And we are well positioned to capitalize on the late surge in spring demand, and I look forward to updating on this first half event on our second quarter call.  \n Now looking at Lowes.com. As Marvin mentioned, we saw a positive 2% sales growth in the quarter and over 39% positive growth on a 2-year basis. We continue to enhance the user experience on Lowes.com and our omnichannel capabilities, which is critical for consumers who increasingly expect flexibility and seamlessness in their shopping experience. Our new paint and countertop visualizers are driving better conversion rates and we also enabled our customers the ability to order bagged goods online for in-store pickup ahead of the spring season.  \n And as Marvin mentioned, our enhanced supply chain capabilities, including our expanded coastal holding facility network are now in place to enable us to flow product quickly to where it's needed as weather breaks across the country. And we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and work to mitigate cost increases within our supply chain.  \n Before I close, I'd like to once again thank our vendor partners and our merchants for their hard work and dedication. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their continued commitment to serving our customers, especially in this busy spring season. We are laser-focused on delivering a consistent and high-quality customer experience. At the same time, we have labor aligned to demand patterns so that we effectively managed our payroll this quarter even in a lower sales environment. The investments that we've made over the past several years and our enhanced labor management tools are clearly paying dividends as we flex labor across stores and departments so effectively that we continue to achieve strong customer satisfaction scores.  \n Also, the technology enhancements that we've made over the past several years enable our associates to spend 60% of their time serving customers and only 40% on manual tasking activities. As a reminder, as recently as 2018, 60% of all associated time was allocated on tasks that did not support the customer. We flipped this ratio by enabling more and more capabilities on our associates handheld mobile devices, which eliminated many time-consuming tasks. This is in addition to new technology that has enhanced our point-of-sale checkout, modernized project management, improved inventory visibility and digitized in-store pricing for appliances and lumber. This improved associate productivity has not only driven profitability, but it has also enhanced our customer service.  \n And we continue to unlock further productivity through our Perpetual Productivity Improvement or PPI initiatives. As a reminder, our PPI initiatives are not onetime efforts but rather a series of initiatives that are scaling across our stores over time, all of which contribute to operational efficiency as well as a culture of continuous improvement. As Marvin mentioned earlier, the success of our PPI initiatives contributed to our strong operating margin performance in Q1.  \n Now I would like to take a few minutes to discuss our strong Pro results in the first quarter when we launched our MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program, which is centered around creating a business partnership with our Pro. We are really pleased to see the better-than-expected adoption rates for the new program and we expect to build on this momentum with the Pros as we launch enhanced features to the loyalty program in the coming months.  \n Through this program, we are also gaining valuable insight about our Pro customers that will enable us to better anticipate and meet their project needs through our Pro CRM platform and allow us to continue to expand our share of wallet with these valuable customers. And we're expanding our Pro fulfillment capabilities with our new Pro fulfillment center in Charlotte, where we are stocking the top SKUs that Pros consistently need in job lot quantities. As we pilot this new approach to Pro fulfillment, we are building on our existing job site delivery capabilities handled through our stores and Lowe's Pro supply branches today. Although we are pleased with our 600 basis points of growth in Pro penetration over the past 3 years, improving our fulfillment capabilities will allow us to accelerate this growth and continue to gain market share.  \n In addition to the success of our new Pro initiatives, I am pleased with our strides to become the employer of choice in retail. As a company, we are committed to investing in continuous learning and development throughout our associates careers through Lowe's University as well as a new debt-free education program that we just announced. Through this initiative, more than 300,000 associates are eligible to participate in over 50 academic programs free of charge. These programs are designed to help associates excel in their jobs today and built toward their future careers within Lowe's, including pathways into supply chain, logistics, data analytics, cybersecurity, technology and more.  \n Finally, I'm pleased to report that we are in a better position from a hiring and staffing standpoint than we were at this time last year. We accelerated our associate hiring process through new technology that dramatically reduce the time it takes process applications. These new tools ensure that we capture the best candidates in the pipeline and helped us staff up quickly for spring. Looking forward, we are making the right investments to continue to drive productivity while also enhancing our customer service, and we are well positioned to serve our customers to meet the surge in demand for spring products.  \n As I close, I would like to once again thank our store associates for their relentless focus on serving customers and driving productivities in our stores. \n With that, I will now turn it over to Brandon. \nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Joe. I'd like to begin by saying what an honor it is to serve as Lowe's CFO. Over the past several years, we've made tremendous progress transforming Lowe's into a leading omnichannel retailer with a world-class finance organization. I'm extremely excited to be joining the executive leadership team in my new capacity as we continue our momentum.  \n Now turning to Q1 results. We delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.51, an increase of 9% compared to prior year driven by improved gross margin rate and disciplined expense management against lower sales. As expected, we lapped our most difficult sales comparison of the year, given the approximately 300-basis-point benefit from government stimulus last year.  \n Q1 sales were $23.7 billion with a comparable sales decrease of 4%. Comparable average ticket grew 9.1%, driven by higher Pro sales, increased levels of product inflation and 150 basis points of commodity inflation. This was offset by comp transaction count declining 13.1% due to a later start to spring as well as the impact of cycling over government stimulus and storm recovery in the prior year. Keep in mind that comp transactions increased 11.8% last year, which results in a 2-year comp transaction count decrease of 2.9%.  \n U.S. comp sales were down 3.8% in the quarter and up 19.7% on a 2-year basis. Our Pro sales outpaced DIY with 20% sales growth in the quarter as we continue to build on our momentum with the Pro driven by our elevated product and service offering. And while demand for core DIY categories remain strong, lower sales in seasonal categories pressured sales by approximately $350 million in the quarter or approximately 150 basis points. On Lowes.com, sales increased 2% in the quarter and over 39% on a 2-year basis.  \n Our U.S. monthly comps were up 8.5% in February, down 7.8% in March and down 6.9% in April. In March, we cycled over the third round of government stimulus and the storm recovery sales in Texas while April sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather. Looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2020 to 2022, February sales increased 34.5%, March increased 25.3% and April increased 6%.  \n Gross margin was 34.03% of sales in the first quarter, up 74 basis points from last year. Product margin rate improved 50 basis points as we leveraged our disciplined pricing and product cost management strategies to effectively manage product cost inflation and lumber price volatility. Also, higher credit revenue drove 25 basis points of benefit to gross margin this quarter, while a favorable product mix drove 20 basis points of benefit. These benefits were partly offset by 10 basis points of pressure from live goods damaged by unseasonably cold weather as well as 10 basis points of planned pressure from increased distribution costs.  \n SG&A of 18.19% levered 21 basis points compared to SG&A in Q1 last year. As Joe mentioned, we drove improved store labor productivity which was offset by lower fixed cost leverage against lower sales and increased wage rate. Operating profit was $3.3 billion, in line with prior year. Operating margin rate of 13.96% of sales levered 67 basis points versus prior year. Our ability to leverage operating margin despite a decline in sales reflects our improved operating capabilities that enable us to rapidly adjust in a dynamic operating environment.  \n The effective tax rate was 23.7%, in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $20.2 billion, up $2.6 billion from Q4 levels in line with seasonal trends. This reflects a $1.9 billion or 10% increase from Q1 2021. Our inventory balance reflects an approximately 13% increase from both product and commodity inflation, while balances were also higher than expected due to a late breaking spring.  \n Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook. Our Q1 performance was in line with our expectations, excluding seasonal categories. However, as Bill mentioned, spring is truly a first half event and the timing is driven by when weather breaks across the country. Over the past 2-plus weeks, we are seeing improved trends in our seasonal categories, which is reinforcing our confidence that we will deliver first half results in line with our full year guide.  \n This morning, we reaffirmed our full year 2022 financial outlook. We continue to expect 2022 sales in a range of $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%. We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY for the year. As a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We continue to expect gross margin rate for the full year to be up slightly as compared to prior year. However, as lumber prices declined several weeks earlier than we expected, gross margin pressure will shift into Q2 as we continue to turn through our higher cost inventory layers. As a result, we now expect to see our gross margin for the first half to be up slightly compared with our gross margin in the first half of 2021.  \n We also continue to expect operating margin in the range of 12.8% to 13% for the full year, driven by a slightly higher gross margin rate and continued execution of our PPI initiatives. We are also confirming our outlook for diluted earnings per share in a range of $13.10 to $13.60. In 2022, we still expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion, and we remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy with approximately $12 billion in share repurchases this year while also supporting our 35% target dividend payout ratio. Finally, we are affirming our outlook of return on invested capital above 36% for the year.  \n Now I'd like to close by reviewing one of our value creation drivers at Lowe's, our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy. In Q1, the company generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow. And through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 19.2 million shares for $4.1 billion, and we paid $537 million in dividends at $0.80 per share. Capital expenditures totaled $343 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the business to drive growth and enhance returns.  \n We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which includes proceeds from our $5 billion notes offering in March. This larger-than-planned bond issuance enabled us to slightly accelerate our share repurchase plans in the quarter. The balance sheet remains extremely healthy, and we continue to make progress towards our target of 2.75x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR, ending the quarter at 2.24x. Driven by both strong operating performance and a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we delivered return on invested capital of 33.8% in the quarter, up 380 basis points versus last year.  \n In closing, we are confident in our trajectory and excited for the substantial opportunity ahead of us as we continue to grow our market share, expand operating margin and deliver meaningful shareholder value. And with that, we are now ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore. \nGregory Melich: I have 2 questions. One is just to understand the shift of spring and stimulus. Should we be looking at a 3-year comp when we think about how that flows in, in the second quarter, sort of in the mid-30s? And then my second question is on inventory. \nBrandon Sink: Greg, this is Brandon. Just as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we came out of April, U.S. comps down 7% for the month. And I'll say early on, we feel really good about our trends in May, especially within our seasonal categories comping positive and above the company average as spring is breaking across the country. We have some of our biggest volume weeks ahead with Memorial Day, Father's Day, J4. We're pleased with the sequential sales improvement, confident in the full Q2 recovery of the $350 million. And then when we look at the balance of the year, I think with the weather trends, Q2, $350 million. We're going to continue to see the Pro strength 20% comp in Q1, [ 64% ] 2 year. Inflation is going to continue to be a bit of a tailwind for us as well. But all that being said, our range is down 1 to plus 1. We're confident in that go-forward for the full year. And that yields Q2 to Q4. That's a slight positive comp over the balance of the year for the 1 year. \nGregory Melich: Perfect. And then on inventory, you mentioned the 10% growth that inflation was -- and mix was about 13% of that. Am I -- does that imply that units are actually down 3% year-on-year. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Greg, Spot on. Inventory balance was up 10%, and we have in the prepared remarks price and commodity inflation, along with carrying additional seasonal inventory in Q2 -- heading into Q2 is pressuring both dollars and terms. I will remind the group every year, we do manage our seasonal inventory to the first half and we have a strong holiday lineup upcoming and a couple of other things. We continue to strategically invest in inventory to support the Pro, job locked quantities and we've had a couple of constrained categories where we've made in-stock improvements, in particular, in paint and appliances. But we're in our best in-stock position since the beginning of the pandemic, and I'll kick it over to Bill, if there's anything more he wants to add there. \nWilliam Boltz: No, I think, Brandon, I think you hit it. I think the key for us is making sure that we're focused on sell-through the seasonal buys that we've made. We shared with you during the fourth quarter call that we brought in some of the seasonal inventory ahead of the season. And so we're focused on working through that through the first half of the year. \nGregory Melich: And you guys haven't seen any trade down, it sounds like? \nMarvin Ellison: Greg, this is Marvin. The answer is no. As you can imagine, we spent quite a bit of time looking at this literally on a daily, weekly basis with the DIY and Pro customer across geographies, online, and we've seen no material trade down in our business. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: First off, Brandon, congratulations on your new role. \nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Brian. \nBrian Nagel: My question, and I get -- maybe I'll direct it to Marvin primarily, but thanks for all the detail on the call. And I guess what I'll say is there, as analysts following where the news of weather disruptions are now well documented. As you look at the business, what gives you the greatest confidence that these slower spring sales were, in fact, weather-related and not indicative of a now say be more cautious consumer pulling back on discretionary spending? \nMarvin Ellison: Brian, this -- it's a really good question. This is Marvin. So I'll take the first part, and I'll let Bill just give more of a product-specific assessment. So when you take a look at the quarter, the month of February was really strong, 8.5% of positive comp in the U.S. In the month of March, we were running to a stimulus overlap and so we were anticipating that negative comping March was, and we had really difficult weather on top of stimulus. And then April, as we mentioned, was the coldest in over 20 years. And when we start to look at the categories and their anticipated performance, it was obvious to us that this was a weather-driven event. \n The good news is, well, I mean, we operate in all states. So we could easily look at the southern parts of the country where we were in something relatively close to seasonal weather and all of these categories were performing exceptionally well, live goods, outdoor power, grilled patio, et cetera. And then the moment we get a glimpse of weather in some of these northern markets, those categories would take off and perform well in the moment, the weather would shift. I mean, obviously, you'd see the decline. \n So the way we analyze this literally on a daily, weekly basis is very obvious to us that the Q1 impact was driven by weather. And as Brandon and I both mentioned in our prepared comments, as we look at the month of May, I mean we're pleased with the trends we're seeing. And that also reflects that the moment we are getting to what is more of a seasonal weather environment, those same categories that underperformed in April, are now overperforming the company in the month of May. So I'll let Bill add any other details. \nWilliam Boltz: No, I think the only thing to add, Marvin, is that we're also seeing strength out of new and innovative product. And so you look at the strength of like the EGO brand and the battery-powered outdoor product just continuing to perform very well. The strength of John Deere, the strength of Aaron's in the riding mower segments doing very well. And as you touched on, as we saw green shoots of weather throughout the first quarter, we saw the strength in project -- outside project businesses like live nursery, like exterior Pro projects. So it just gives us good confidence that we can carry that through Q2. \nJoseph McFarland: Brian, I'll just add one additional comment there. If you look at our Pro growth that Marvin mentioned earlier at 20%, and then you look at the strength and the health of that Pro -- strong Pro market trends we're seeing, our revamped Lowe's Pro offering, the expanded Pro product that Bill mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, the deeper inventory and then the launch of our new MVP program. And so I think we've got good confidence in the underlying trends there. \nBrian Nagel: That's all very helpful. I appreciate it. And I guess just one really quick follow-up. So as we think about these seasonal sales and the weakness that happened in Q1, is it fair to assume that basically, all the sales should be made up here in Q2? In other words, there's really no lost demand? \nBrandon Sink: Brian, that's correct. It's fair to assume that the $350 million would shift in fall of Q2. \nOperator: Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: So the first quarter earnings, at least beat the Street handily and you're not making any change to the year. I think the second quarter, it sounds like you'll make up some sales. And so the first half will be the same. The fact that first quarter was better, did it -- and by the way, no one is getting paid or rewarded for raising any outlook. So I guess, implicitly, it means that something was taken out. I don't know if that's the right way to think of it or just there's conservatism. So curious your thoughts around that? And anything that is changing in the second half, the way you're looking at the business since you have some head start here in the first quarter. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. So Simeon, this is Brandon. A lot of this is timing-related and specifically around gross margin. So as I said in my prepared results remarks for Q1, 74 basis points of improvement driven by product margin rate mix. We also benefited from proprietary credit. But keep in mind, the benefits on the product margin side are temporary in nature, especially -- can be temporary in nature, especially in periods of inflation. Cost layers are going to lag and that's true for both commodity and product-related inflation. \n So as we cycle into Q2, we do expect some level of step back, specifically due to lumber deflation that began. We began seeing that late March. And then we have some other variables, such as shrink in credit. We expect that to largely be neutral over the back half. And then the supply chain, inclusive of market delivery build-out, higher transportation costs are going to be a slight drag, which is consistent with what we've guided and what we've messaged. So it's mainly margin, it's mainly timing as the cost layers turn a bit of a step back. But for overall margin, modest improvement in margins for first half and up slightly for the full year. So that's the reason we didn't flow the beat to the full year. \nMarvin Ellison: So Simeon, this is Marvin. I think it's important for me to note that we're really pleased with the profit performance in the first half. For a retailer our size is really difficult to have declining sales on a year-over-year basis and have leverage from an operating margin and gross margin perspective. That took a lot of work and a lot of operational discipline from the supply chain, cost management, payroll and expense management, et cetera. And to Brandon's point, we're in this unprecedented environment of lumber inflation and deflation. And so we're just planning conservatively because as we say, the last couple of weeks, we start to see lumber starting to shift, and we're just anticipating that, that's going to give us some headwind in Q2. \nSimeon Gutman: That's helpful. My follow-up, it's related on fuel prices. And Brandon, you just touched on transportation costs. Does this mean that you're adjusting your pricing as well real time? I know you mentioned you'll feel a little pressure, so maybe you don't fully offset it. And does the level of inflation help your business on the top line? Or you assume that there might be some unit degradation as pricing may continue to tick higher? \nMarvin Ellison: So let me take -- this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of that. We've spent a lot of time putting in improved systems from a pricing standpoint. So we are scraping and we're doing pricing analysis real time, both in-store and online by geography. One thing that Bill put in place early on when he arrived is that every day competitive pricing strategy where we've gotten off this high-low promotional cadence that Lowe's was known for to more of an everyday competitive price. And the only way you can be competitive every day is you have to have a good line of sight to the competitive prices of your competition by category, by geographic location. \n And so we've done a lot of that. And in some cases, with inflation -- product inflation, we have to carry that forward to the consumer. But in a lot of cases, we're just focused on being competitively priced. And I'll let Brandon provide some financial specifics of what that looks like. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Simeon, I would just add to your question on fuel costs, transportation, also add import container cost into that mix. The teams have done a great job just giving us visibility to where those costs are, when they're going to hit. And it is correct to say as we manage the totality of the portfolio that, that's a consideration set along with direct costs from the vendor. So we are managing that appropriately, managing in this retail environment. So that would be the only additional thing I would add to the comment. \n On transportation, in particular, on fuel, it is a more minor cost of the overall portfolio. When we look at the totality of supply chain, and we feel like we're doing some other things like managing trailers, intermodal and leaning into some of those other things to also help offset that. \nOperator: Next question today is coming from Karen Short from Barclays. \nKaren Short: So I had a couple of questions. Just in terms of how you think about traffic versus ticket with respect to your guide, can you maybe talk about that a little bit more? And then within your margin structure, I mean, I do think there's definitional differences with you and your largest competitor on how you actually think about square footage. But can you maybe just give us an update on -- in terms of your 13% operating margin or and/or bridging the gap with your largest competitor? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Karen, let me start with the first question, and I'll pass it back to Marvin to get the second point. So on the ticket transaction side, I'll point to Q1 ticket, specifically inflation, a little bit harder to pinpoint. But we do believe from an inflation standpoint, we ran high single digits during Q1, and that's inclusive of 150 basis points from lumber and commodity. And I'll say the finance and merchant teams are still in the thick of this. We're working with our suppliers day in, day out to figure this out. \n I will say, however, as we lap second half of '21, we do expect the inflation impact to start to moderate. We're expecting mid to high single-digits positive over the balance of the year. And then on the transaction side, as we mentioned in the opening comments, DIY was a primary driver of the decrease there for Q1. It was down double digits, partly planned due to the Texas storms and the stimulus, the weather miss from spring delayed accelerated that. We do believe Q1 will be our low watermark on transactions for 2022 and that, that transaction decrease should moderate as we cycle through the balance of the year. \n So net-net, mid to high single-digit positive ticket expected over the balance of the year, offset by down transactions is the formula that will get us to the flat comp, and we expect that dynamic to narrow ticket and transactions as we move through the balance of the year. \nMarvin Ellison: Karen, I'll take the other question. When you think about our operating margin and you think about kind of the more structural differences between us and our largest competitor, I think it really comes down to the penetration of DIY versus Pro. I think that's an obvious reflection in the first quarter. The good news for us is, we're not setting a Pro penetration target. We just have an expectation we're going to continue to improve that business. And if you think about my prepared comments, in the last 3 years, we've been increasing our Pro penetration by roughly 600 basis points. So we feel like that we're headed in the right direction. \n But as you think about overall operating income, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter, and we have a very good line of sight to getting us to that 13% and beyond just based on executing our Total Home strategy, focusing on Pro, online and all the work that Bill's team is doing on private brands and how we're continuing to grow that business. In the private brands specific initiative, it drives margin improvement. It gives the customer great innovation and style and we can do it all at a really competitive price and it's a key point of differentiation in addition to all the investments we're making in infrastructure, whether that's supply chain or operations and infrastructure. Again, we feel like we have a clear line of sight, and we're going to continue to execute to that, and we have an expectation that we're going to be on track with delivering on that expectation. \nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So my first question is just following up on the May commentary. You talked about DIY now running ahead of the total company average comp. If you're still getting 20% growth in Pro backing into that math, that will sort of cleanly get you above the mid-single-digit comp. Is that math reasonable? \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Chris, this is Brandon. I don't know that we said that DIY is going to be running ahead of Pro in Q2. I would say the majority of the $350 million that we expect to recover is going to be reflected in the DIY business. But the Pro DIY dynamic, certainly unique in Q1, just given the environment we've been in and what we've been cycling, but that breakout in that dynamic, Q2 to Q4 should start to normalize a bit. But Pro is absolutely going to be expected to outpace DIY, grow 2x that of market, which will translate to our guide of down 1% to up 1%. And I'll just remind you, the seasonal performance in the seasonal business through the first couple of weeks outperforming expectations in the balance of the business. So that's how I would answer your question. \nChristopher Horvers: Okay. Sorry, I thought you said outperforming the company average. It was outperforming expectations. \nBrandon Sink: Correct. Correct. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. All right. Sorry about that. And then in terms of -- Marvin, in the press release, it seems like you added just a line around sort of increased macro uncertainty. To an earlier question, you mentioned not seeing any trade down effect in a very responsive business to the weather. So can you expand on that? Is there something you are observing? Is it just simply given all the puts and takes on the consumer being less fulsome now versus maybe 3 months ago? \nMarvin Ellison: It's really more of an acknowledgment of what we're all seeing in just a broader macro economy. And I think what's interesting for home improvement is that, we're aware that we have inflation concerns. We're aware that there is rising interest rates. But as we look at the home improvement sector, we still remain very confident in the outlook and we're very confident in the sector. And so I'll just repeat what I've said. We've seen no material trade down from our customers. We closely monitor Pro and DIY. We look at it intently as you can imagine. \n And when we think about the key economic drivers of our business, it remains home price appreciation. It remains the age of housing stock, it remains those things that give the homeowner confidence and continuing to invest in the home. And as we talk to our Pro customers, they're booked up for the year. We talked to our DIY customers, they would just wait for the sun to come out. And so we feel good about the home improvement sector. And my statement was just more of an acknowledgment of the broader macro environment that we're all seeing. \nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. \nElizabeth Lane: So we've written recently about how 95% of the base of U.S. homeowners are not impacted by interest rates and that housing turnover isn't really as important as home price appreciation. But the pushback we've gotten is that those 5% of homes that do change hands presumably see a greater degree of renovation spending. So my question is, have you seen any reliable stats on how much the average homeowner spends on renovation when they prepare a home for sale and when they purchase a home? Because we're just trying to get a sense of what that portion of the home improvement market is actually impacted by rising rates. \nMarvin Ellison: Liz, it would be anecdotal at best. So we don't have any firm data to represent that. But our view of it and our conversations with Pros and consumers, you tell us that your statement is correct. But again, we don't have any fact-based data to support that. \nElizabeth Lane: And then just a quick follow-up on how product innovation has contributed to average ticket. I mean, the growth in average ticket is obviously more than just inflation. So what do you view as the categories where product innovation may be accelerating the normal replacement cycle and how much of a tailwind that could be when inflation does ultimately normalize? \nWilliam Boltz: Yes, Liz, it's Bill. And so what we're seeing with product innovation, we really see it across the store, across every category. But in areas like appliances, you see customers trading up to smart appliances to better quality appliances. As I mentioned in an earlier question in response, battery outdoor power equipment with the EGO brand specifically. You're also seeing it in the likes of gas-powered outdoor power with John Deere and Aaron's, all innovative products there. You're seeing it in paint. So just really across the categories, you see innovation. \n And we're also able to offer that in our private brands with the introductions of STAINMASTER. So you're seeing that now start to weave its way in. I talked about -- it's already been in carpet and now you're seeing in tile, vinyl, laminate flooring. So you got Origin 21, which is a new modern brand for us, again, offers great innovation and great value. \nMarvin Ellison: And Liz, this is Marvin again. I just want to reinforce the point on the value of home price appreciation to consumer confidence. And it's one of the reasons why I think home improvement is a unique retail sector in kind of this macro environment where there are a lot of questions about the health of the consumer. What our data tells us and it correlates historically is when your home value is going up, you simply have more confidence to invest in that home because you see it as an investment and not an expense. \n And we have unprecedented home price appreciation, but we also have an unprecedented supply-demand issue for the availability of homes. So our data tells us, this is less of bubble and it's more of a supply-demand issue where you have 1.5 million, 2 million homes of demand versus the availability. And so if you think about what Bill said about trading up, our customers, they feel more comfortable investing in home because they think they're going to get a return on that investment. And I think that's the value of home price appreciation to our business. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. \nZachary Fadem: Can you help me reconcile the sequential step-down in SG&A dollars? How much would you quantify as seasonal versus what would you call structural or PPI-driven? And then how should we square the Q1 SG&A takeout versus the balance of the year? \nMarvin Ellison: So Zach, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of that, and then I'm going to let Brandon and Joe provide some context. So relative to payroll, we have an activity-based payroll model that allows us to flex hours up and down based on sales velocity by location of store, but also by department. That is a significant contrast to what we had in place when I arrived in summer of 2018 that we literally were riding complete the schedule from Mooresville, North Carolina and sending that out to every store on a weekly basis, irrespective of volume trends. So I'll let Joe talk about payroll, so you can get a view of why we were able to leverage as effectively as we did in Q1 and how we think that's a sustainable result that we'll see for the balance of the year. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Listen, from a payroll standpoint, I think it's important to think about the PPI initiatives as not just onetime initiatives, but ongoing initiatives. And so as we look at our ability to leverage SG&A through different initiatives, centralized RTVs and get down a whole list of the PPI initiatives. So this is not a onetime, but it's going to continue. And I think we've done it very effectively because both Pro and the do-it-yourself customer are showing increased LTR and service scores. So I think that just kind of points to some good productivity. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. And the only other thing I would add, Zach, so SG&A leveraged 21 basis points. That's consistent with the earnings algorithm we have for the full year in the range of what we would expect. I think the good news there being able to leverage against our quarter with the highest expected negative comp is going to be a great proof point for us and as we move through the year. And then in this inflationary environment, I think, to Joe's point, really being able to use those workforce optimization tools, understand truly within the business, both in the supply chain and in stores, what are volumes, what are units, what are transactions and being able to flex the model against that demand and understand the split between the drivers of the business has been really powerful for us. So I'll just add to that. \nZachary Fadem: Got it. And with the spread between your Pro and DIY comps widening to about 30 points in the quarter, I realize the weather and seasonal component will normalize. But as you think about the balance of the year, how do you square overall industry Pro industry growth versus DIY this year? And is it fair to assume your Pro business can track at a double-digit rate from here? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, Zach, we talked about our expectation to grow 2x the market in Pro. We think that, that is achievable based on the list of Pro-related products that Bill and his merchant teams have added to our assortment based on our new MVP Loyalty Program that's exceeding expectations on the number of enrollments. And one other really interesting data point, if we look at the Pro customers currently enrolled in our new MVP Loyalty Program and our credit program, they're spending 300% more than Pro customers not enrolled. So it gives us a lot of confidence that our Pro growth is sustainable. \n And not to mention with some other initiatives that we are filing to include job site fulfillment that we think will give us an opportunity to start in the future to serve a larger Pro. So based on all of those initiatives, we feel like that our Pro growth will continue. Look, it's challenging, none of us have a crystal ball, obviously, and there are a lot of dynamics in our Pro DIY mix. Having said that, we factored all those things into our guidance, and we think that the guidance, as Brandon reinforced is reflected on our view of how we think the DIY Pro mix will play out for the rest of the year. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in August. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Over the past several years, we've made tremendous progress transforming Lowe's into a leading omnichannel retailer with a world-class finance organization. I'm extremely excited to be joining the executive leadership team in my new capacity as we continue our momentum.  \n Now turning to Q1 results. We delivered diluted earnings per share of $3.51, an increase of 9% compared to prior year driven by improved gross margin rate and disciplined expense management against lower sales. As expected, we lapped our most difficult sales comparison of the year, given the approximately 300-basis-point benefit from government stimulus last year.  \n Q1 sales were $23.7 billion with a comparable sales decrease of 4%. Comparable average ticket grew 9.1%, driven by higher Pro sales, increased levels of product inflation and 150 basis points of commodity inflation. This was offset by comp transaction count declining 13.1% due to a later start to spring as well as the impact of cycling over government stimulus and storm recovery in the prior year. Keep in mind that comp transactions increased 11.8% last year, which results in a 2-year comp transaction count decrease of 2.9%.  \n U.S. comp sales were down 3.8% in the quarter and up 19.7% on a 2-year basis. Our Pro sales outpaced DIY with 20% sales growth in the quarter as we continue to build on our momentum with the Pro driven by our elevated product and service offering. And while demand for core DIY categories remain strong, lower sales in seasonal categories pressured sales by approximately $350 million in the quarter or approximately 150 basis points. On Lowes.com, sales increased 2% in the quarter and over 39% on a 2-year basis.  \n Our U.S. monthly comps were up 8.5% in February, down 7.8% in March and down 6.9% in April. In March, we cycled over the third round of government stimulus and the storm recovery sales in Texas while April sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather. Looking at U.S. comp growth on a 2-year basis from 2020 to 2022, February sales increased 34.5%, March increased 25.3% and April increased 6%.  \n Gross margin was 34.03% of sales in the first quarter, up 74 basis points from last year. Product margin rate improved 50 basis points as we leveraged our disciplined pricing and product cost management strategies to effectively manage product cost inflation and lumber price volatility. Also, higher credit revenue drove 25 basis points of benefit to gross margin this quarter, while a favorable product mix drove 20 basis points of benefit. These benefits were partly offset by 10 basis points of pressure from live goods damaged by unseasonably cold weather as well as 10 basis points of planned pressure from increased distribution costs.  \n SG&A of 18.19% levered 21 basis points compared to SG&A in Q1 last year. As Joe mentioned, we drove improved store labor productivity which was offset by lower fixed cost leverage against lower sales and increased wage rate. Operating profit was $3.3 billion, in line with prior year. Operating margin rate of 13.96% of sales levered 67 basis points versus prior year. Our ability to leverage operating margin despite a decline in sales reflects our improved operating capabilities that enable us to rapidly adjust in a dynamic operating environment.  \n The effective tax rate was 23.7%, in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $20.2 billion, up $2.6 billion from Q4 levels in line with seasonal trends. This reflects a $1.9 billion or 10% increase from Q1 2021. Our inventory balance reflects an approximately 13% increase from both product and commodity inflation, while balances were also higher than expected due to a late breaking spring.  \n Now turning to our 2022 financial outlook. Our Q1 performance was in line with our expectations, excluding seasonal categories. However, as Bill mentioned, spring is truly a first half event and the timing is driven by when weather breaks across the country. Over the past 2-plus weeks, we are seeing improved trends in our seasonal categories, which is reinforcing our confidence that we will deliver first half results in line with our full year guide.  \n This morning, we reaffirmed our full year 2022 financial outlook. We continue to expect 2022 sales in a range of $97 billion to $99 billion for the year, representing comparable sales of down 1% to up 1%. We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY for the year. As a reminder, our 2022 sales outlook includes a 53rd week, which equates to approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion in sales. We continue to expect gross margin rate for the full year to be up slightly as compared to prior year. However, as lumber prices declined several weeks earlier than we expected, gross margin pressure will shift into Q2 as we continue to turn through our higher cost inventory layers. As a result, we now expect to see our gross margin for the first half to be up slightly compared with our gross margin in the first half of 2021.  \n We also continue to expect operating margin in the range of 12.8% to 13% for the full year, driven by a slightly higher gross margin rate and continued execution of our PPI initiatives. We are also confirming our outlook for diluted earnings per share in a range of $13.10 to $13.60. In 2022, we still expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion, and we remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy with approximately $12 billion in share repurchases this year while also supporting our 35% target dividend payout ratio. Finally, we are affirming our outlook of return on invested capital above 36% for the year.  \n Now I'd like to close by reviewing one of our value creation drivers at Lowe's, our shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy. In Q1, the company generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow. And through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, we returned $4.7 billion to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 19.2 million shares for $4.1 billion, and we paid $537 million in dividends at $0.80 per share. Capital expenditures totaled $343 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the business to drive growth and enhance returns.  \n We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which includes proceeds from our $5 billion notes offering in March. This larger-than-planned bond issuance enabled us to slightly accelerate our share repurchase plans in the quarter. The balance sheet remains extremely healthy, and we continue to make progress towards our target of 2.75x adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR, ending the quarter at 2.24x. Driven by both strong operating performance and a disciplined capital allocation strategy, we delivered return on invested capital of 33.8% in the quarter, up 380 basis points versus last year.  \n In closing, we are confident in our trajectory and excited for the substantial opportunity ahead of us as we continue to grow our market share, expand operating margin and deliver meaningful shareholder value. And with that, we are now ready for questions. Greg, this is Brandon. Just as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we came out of April, U.S. comps down 7% for the month. And I'll say early on, we feel really good about our trends in May, especially within our seasonal categories comping positive and above the company average as spring is breaking across the country. We have some of our biggest volume weeks ahead with Memorial Day, Father's Day, J4. We're pleased with the sequential sales improvement, confident in the full Q2 recovery of the $350 million. And then when we look at the balance of the year, I think with the weather trends, Q2, $350 million. We're going to continue to see the Pro strength 20% comp in Q1, [ 64% ] 2 year. Inflation is going to continue to be a bit of a tailwind for us as well. But all that being said, our range is down 1 to plus 1. We're confident in that go-forward for the full year. And that yields Q2 to Q4. That's a slight positive comp over the balance of the year for the 1 year. Yes, Greg, Spot on. Inventory balance was up 10%, and we have in the prepared remarks price and commodity inflation, along with carrying additional seasonal inventory in Q2 -- heading into Q2 is pressuring both dollars and terms. I will remind the group every year, we do manage our seasonal inventory to the first half and we have a strong holiday lineup upcoming and a couple of other things. We continue to strategically invest in inventory to support the Pro, job locked quantities and we've had a couple of constrained categories where we've made in-stock improvements, in particular, in paint and appliances. But we're in our best in-stock position since the beginning of the pandemic, and I'll kick it over to Bill, if there's anything more he wants to add there. Thank you, Brian. Brian, that's correct. It's fair to assume that the $350 million would shift in fall of Q2. Yes. So Simeon, this is Brandon. A lot of this is timing-related and specifically around gross margin. So as I said in my prepared results remarks for Q1, 74 basis points of improvement driven by product margin rate mix. We also benefited from proprietary credit. But keep in mind, the benefits on the product margin side are temporary in nature, especially -- can be temporary in nature, especially in periods of inflation. Cost layers are going to lag and that's true for both commodity and product-related inflation. \n So as we cycle into Q2, we do expect some level of step back, specifically due to lumber deflation that began. We began seeing that late March. And then we have some other variables, such as shrink in credit. We expect that to largely be neutral over the back half. And then the supply chain, inclusive of market delivery build-out, higher transportation costs are going to be a slight drag, which is consistent with what we've guided and what we've messaged. So it's mainly margin, it's mainly timing as the cost layers turn a bit of a step back. But for overall margin, modest improvement in margins for first half and up slightly for the full year. So that's the reason we didn't flow the beat to the full year. Yes, Simeon, I would just add to your question on fuel costs, transportation, also add import container cost into that mix. The teams have done a great job just giving us visibility to where those costs are, when they're going to hit. And it is correct to say as we manage the totality of the portfolio that, that's a consideration set along with direct costs from the vendor. So we are managing that appropriately, managing in this retail environment. So that would be the only additional thing I would add to the comment. \n On transportation, in particular, on fuel, it is a more minor cost of the overall portfolio. When we look at the totality of supply chain, and we feel like we're doing some other things like managing trailers, intermodal and leaning into some of those other things to also help offset that. Yes. Karen, let me start with the first question, and I'll pass it back to Marvin to get the second point. So on the ticket transaction side, I'll point to Q1 ticket, specifically inflation, a little bit harder to pinpoint. But we do believe from an inflation standpoint, we ran high single digits during Q1, and that's inclusive of 150 basis points from lumber and commodity. And I'll say the finance and merchant teams are still in the thick of this. We're working with our suppliers day in, day out to figure this out. \n I will say, however, as we lap second half of '21, we do expect the inflation impact to start to moderate. We're expecting mid to high single-digits positive over the balance of the year. And then on the transaction side, as we mentioned in the opening comments, DIY was a primary driver of the decrease there for Q1. It was down double digits, partly planned due to the Texas storms and the stimulus, the weather miss from spring delayed accelerated that. We do believe Q1 will be our low watermark on transactions for 2022 and that, that transaction decrease should moderate as we cycle through the balance of the year. \n So net-net, mid to high single-digit positive ticket expected over the balance of the year, offset by down transactions is the formula that will get us to the flat comp, and we expect that dynamic to narrow ticket and transactions as we move through the balance of the year. Yes, Chris, this is Brandon. I don't know that we said that DIY is going to be running ahead of Pro in Q2. I would say the majority of the $350 million that we expect to recover is going to be reflected in the DIY business. But the Pro DIY dynamic, certainly unique in Q1, just given the environment we've been in and what we've been cycling, but that breakout in that dynamic, Q2 to Q4 should start to normalize a bit. But Pro is absolutely going to be expected to outpace DIY, grow 2x that of market, which will translate to our guide of down 1% to up 1%. And I'll just remind you, the seasonal performance in the seasonal business through the first couple of weeks outperforming expectations in the balance of the business. So that's how I would answer your question. Correct. Correct. Yes. And the only other thing I would add, Zach, so SG&A leveraged 21 basis points. That's consistent with the earnings algorithm we have for the full year in the range of what we would expect. I think the good news there being able to leverage against our quarter with the highest expected negative comp is going to be a great proof point for us and as we move through the year. And then in this inflationary environment, I think, to Joe's point, really being able to use those workforce optimization tools, understand truly within the business, both in the supply chain and in stores, what are volumes, what are units, what are transactions and being able to flex the model against that demand and understand the split between the drivers of the business has been really powerful for us. So I'll just add to that."

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone.  \n In the first quarter, our total company comparable sales declined 4% with the U.S. comps down 3.8%. Excluding our seasonal category, sales were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. \n Looking at sales goals on a 2-year basis, total company comps and U.S. comps were up approximately 20%. In Pro, we delivered growth of 20% and 64% on a 2-year basis. We also saw solid DIY demand for core nonseasonal home improvement projects. However, we experienced a delayed spring selling season due to prolonged unfavorable weather that impacted spring-related categories.  \n In fact, to put this into historical context, the past April was the coldest in over 20 years and one of the wettest in recent memory. But now spring has finally arrived, and we are seeing the anticipated improvement in our seasonal sales in the month of May.  \n I would like to provide some perspective on the impact that a very delayed spring has on our do-it-yourself or DIY sales. As a reminder, roughly 75% of our sales are to the DIY consumer in many seasonal categories like live goods, outdoor power equipment, grills and patio furniture are more heavily concentrated in DIY. And while spring was delayed across all geographies, the season came particularly late in the north, where sales were down double digits in many of our northern markets. And at the same time, sales in our Florida, Charlotte, Nashville, Houston, Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond regions were ahead of our sales expectations, even though spring weather was unfavorable in those regions as well. Simply stated, the further north you look, the larger the negative impact to our seasonal categories.  \n Although the late spring postponed our DIY sales, our Pro customers continue to shop to fuel their strong business demand. And our recent Pro surveys indicate that the majority of our Pro customers continue to report strength in their business and a full slate of projects for the year. At Lowe's, we see spring as a first half event. And as I mentioned, we are encouraged by the improved sales trends we're seeing in the month of May. We're also ready to capitalize on the increased demand with our enhanced assortment, strong inventory position, improved supply chain capabilities and seasonal staffing in place to serve our customers. Later in the call, Bill will discuss our plans to win spring again this year, while Joe will discuss how we are serving our customers during this busy season.  \n Importantly, our Total Home strategy has given us the agility and flexibility to deliver operating margin improvement even when sales decline. During the quarter, operating margin expanded approximately 65 basis points, leading to diluted earnings per share of $3.51, which is an increase of over 9% versus last year. These results reflect great operational discipline in addition to excellent execution in a number of key initiatives, including our enhanced labor management tools, our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives, and our improved pricing capabilities.  \n Our Total Home strategy also enabled us to win with both the Pro and DIY customer in Q1 as we elevate our product assortment and provide our customers with the products and brands that they need across all of their home improvement projects.  \n Let me now discuss the progress that we're making with our Pro customer. As I mentioned, we delivered Pro growth of 20% in the quarter on top of 36% comps last year. The progress with this very important customer is reflected in the nearly 600-basis-point increase in Pro sales penetration in the U.S. from approximately 19% in Q1 of 2019 to approximately 25% in 2022. Later in the call, Joe will discuss how we continue to drive growth in Pro with the early success of our Lowe's MVP's Pro Rewards and Partnership Program that was launched in the first quarter.  \n On Lowes.com, sales grew 2% on top of over 36% growth in the first quarter of 2021, which represents a 2-year comp of over 39% and nearly 10% sales penetration. As we enhance our omnichannel offering, we are gaining traction with consumers who increasingly expect a fully integrated shopping experience. We're also expanding our market delivery strategy by adding other big and bulky products in Florida including patio, grills and riding lawn mowers to the appliances that we already deliver from our cross-dock terminals. By adding these incremental products, we're better leveraging our fixed costs while enhancing customer service at the same time. We've also converted our fourth geographic area, the Tennessee, Kentucky region to this new delivery model. And we're on track to convert our full portfolio of stores to market delivery by the end of 2023.  \n Turning to our results in Canada where our performance lagged the U.S. in Q1. Last year, Canada's results benefited from record high lumber prices due to the higher lumber mix in our Canadian business.  \n In closing, despite some increased uncertainty in the macro environment, our long-term outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive. Homeowner balance sheets are very strong, and their confidence to purchase big-ticket items is supported by continuing home price appreciation. Other factors like the extension of remote work, the age of the housing stock, millennial household formation and baby boomers preference to age in place, all are long-term tailwinds for home improvement.  \n And over the past few years, we have greatly improved our operating capabilities so that we now have the agility needed to respond in this dynamic macro environment. These enhanced capabilities will allow us to continue to take market share while expanding our operating margin.  \n And as a reflection of Lowe's' commitment to the community, at the beginning of the year, we announced a new community impact program called Lowe's Hometowns. This is a 5-year $100 million investment to improve the communities in which we live and work and to ensure we remain committed to giving back to our customers.  \n And before I close, I would like to welcome Brandon Sink to his new role as EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Brandon brings tenure, home improvement expertise and strong financial and operational acumen to this role, and we're excited to have him on the executive leadership team. I would also like to take a moment to thank Dave Denton for the contribution he made as CFO in the past 3 years. \n And at Lowe's, we believe that our store associates are a competitive advantage, and I would like to close by thanking our frontline associates for their hard work and dedication.  \n And with that, I will turn the call over to Bill. Greg, this is Marvin. The answer is no. As you can imagine, we spent quite a bit of time looking at this literally on a daily, weekly basis with the DIY and Pro customer across geographies, online, and we've seen no material trade down in our business. Brian, this -- it's a really good question. This is Marvin. So I'll take the first part, and I'll let Bill just give more of a product-specific assessment. So when you take a look at the quarter, the month of February was really strong, 8.5% of positive comp in the U.S. In the month of March, we were running to a stimulus overlap and so we were anticipating that negative comping March was, and we had really difficult weather on top of stimulus. And then April, as we mentioned, was the coldest in over 20 years. And when we start to look at the categories and their anticipated performance, it was obvious to us that this was a weather-driven event. \n The good news is, well, I mean, we operate in all states. So we could easily look at the southern parts of the country where we were in something relatively close to seasonal weather and all of these categories were performing exceptionally well, live goods, outdoor power, grilled patio, et cetera. And then the moment we get a glimpse of weather in some of these northern markets, those categories would take off and perform well in the moment, the weather would shift. I mean, obviously, you'd see the decline. \n So the way we analyze this literally on a daily, weekly basis is very obvious to us that the Q1 impact was driven by weather. And as Brandon and I both mentioned in our prepared comments, as we look at the month of May, I mean we're pleased with the trends we're seeing. And that also reflects that the moment we are getting to what is more of a seasonal weather environment, those same categories that underperformed in April, are now overperforming the company in the month of May. So I'll let Bill add any other details. So Simeon, this is Marvin. I think it's important for me to note that we're really pleased with the profit performance in the first half. For a retailer our size is really difficult to have declining sales on a year-over-year basis and have leverage from an operating margin and gross margin perspective. That took a lot of work and a lot of operational discipline from the supply chain, cost management, payroll and expense management, et cetera. And to Brandon's point, we're in this unprecedented environment of lumber inflation and deflation. And so we're just planning conservatively because as we say, the last couple of weeks, we start to see lumber starting to shift, and we're just anticipating that, that's going to give us some headwind in Q2. So let me take -- this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of that. We've spent a lot of time putting in improved systems from a pricing standpoint. So we are scraping and we're doing pricing analysis real time, both in-store and online by geography. One thing that Bill put in place early on when he arrived is that every day competitive pricing strategy where we've gotten off this high-low promotional cadence that Lowe's was known for to more of an everyday competitive price. And the only way you can be competitive every day is you have to have a good line of sight to the competitive prices of your competition by category, by geographic location. \n And so we've done a lot of that. And in some cases, with inflation -- product inflation, we have to carry that forward to the consumer. But in a lot of cases, we're just focused on being competitively priced. And I'll let Brandon provide some financial specifics of what that looks like. Karen, I'll take the other question. When you think about our operating margin and you think about kind of the more structural differences between us and our largest competitor, I think it really comes down to the penetration of DIY versus Pro. I think that's an obvious reflection in the first quarter. The good news for us is, we're not setting a Pro penetration target. We just have an expectation we're going to continue to improve that business. And if you think about my prepared comments, in the last 3 years, we've been increasing our Pro penetration by roughly 600 basis points. So we feel like that we're headed in the right direction. \n But as you think about overall operating income, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter, and we have a very good line of sight to getting us to that 13% and beyond just based on executing our Total Home strategy, focusing on Pro, online and all the work that Bill's team is doing on private brands and how we're continuing to grow that business. In the private brands specific initiative, it drives margin improvement. It gives the customer great innovation and style and we can do it all at a really competitive price and it's a key point of differentiation in addition to all the investments we're making in infrastructure, whether that's supply chain or operations and infrastructure. Again, we feel like we have a clear line of sight, and we're going to continue to execute to that, and we have an expectation that we're going to be on track with delivering on that expectation. It's really more of an acknowledgment of what we're all seeing in just a broader macro economy. And I think what's interesting for home improvement is that, we're aware that we have inflation concerns. We're aware that there is rising interest rates. But as we look at the home improvement sector, we still remain very confident in the outlook and we're very confident in the sector. And so I'll just repeat what I've said. We've seen no material trade down from our customers. We closely monitor Pro and DIY. We look at it intently as you can imagine. \n And when we think about the key economic drivers of our business, it remains home price appreciation. It remains the age of housing stock, it remains those things that give the homeowner confidence and continuing to invest in the home. And as we talk to our Pro customers, they're booked up for the year. We talked to our DIY customers, they would just wait for the sun to come out. And so we feel good about the home improvement sector. And my statement was just more of an acknowledgment of the broader macro environment that we're all seeing. Liz, it would be anecdotal at best. So we don't have any firm data to represent that. But our view of it and our conversations with Pros and consumers, you tell us that your statement is correct. But again, we don't have any fact-based data to support that. And Liz, this is Marvin again. I just want to reinforce the point on the value of home price appreciation to consumer confidence. And it's one of the reasons why I think home improvement is a unique retail sector in kind of this macro environment where there are a lot of questions about the health of the consumer. What our data tells us and it correlates historically is when your home value is going up, you simply have more confidence to invest in that home because you see it as an investment and not an expense. \n And we have unprecedented home price appreciation, but we also have an unprecedented supply-demand issue for the availability of homes. So our data tells us, this is less of bubble and it's more of a supply-demand issue where you have 1.5 million, 2 million homes of demand versus the availability. And so if you think about what Bill said about trading up, our customers, they feel more comfortable investing in home because they think they're going to get a return on that investment. And I think that's the value of home price appreciation to our business. So Zach, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of that, and then I'm going to let Brandon and Joe provide some context. So relative to payroll, we have an activity-based payroll model that allows us to flex hours up and down based on sales velocity by location of store, but also by department. That is a significant contrast to what we had in place when I arrived in summer of 2018 that we literally were riding complete the schedule from Mooresville, North Carolina and sending that out to every store on a weekly basis, irrespective of volume trends. So I'll let Joe talk about payroll, so you can get a view of why we were able to leverage as effectively as we did in Q1 and how we think that's a sustainable result that we'll see for the balance of the year. Well, Zach, we talked about our expectation to grow 2x the market in Pro. We think that, that is achievable based on the list of Pro-related products that Bill and his merchant teams have added to our assortment based on our new MVP Loyalty Program that's exceeding expectations on the number of enrollments. And one other really interesting data point, if we look at the Pro customers currently enrolled in our new MVP Loyalty Program and our credit program, they're spending 300% more than Pro customers not enrolled. So it gives us a lot of confidence that our Pro growth is sustainable. \n And not to mention with some other initiatives that we are filing to include job site fulfillment that we think will give us an opportunity to start in the future to serve a larger Pro. So based on all of those initiatives, we feel like that our Pro growth will continue. Look, it's challenging, none of us have a crystal ball, obviously, and there are a lot of dynamics in our Pro DIY mix. Having said that, we factored all those things into our guidance, and we think that the guidance, as Brandon reinforced is reflected on our view of how we think the DIY Pro mix will play out for the rest of the year."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.  \n In the first quarter, U.S. comparable sales declined 3.8%, but were up 19.7% on a 2-year basis. This quarter, we delivered a strong positive comp in building products, driven by our momentum with the Pro, while sales in home decor came in above our expectations driven by solid DIY demand. However, comps and hardlines were down compared to prior year as a delayed spring season impacted seasonal categories.  \n We are particularly pleased to see improved demand in seasonal categories over the past few weeks as the spring weather has finally arrived. In the quarter, 10 of 15 categories were above company average while 8 categories were up over 20% on a 2-year basis. Within our home decor division, paint and flooring delivered the strongest comps this quarter. Inside our paint category, the biggest growth drivers were in interior and exterior paint and primers as our in-stocks continue to improve throughout the quarter.  \n Also, our investments in our Pro Paint offering continue to pay off as we've enhanced our Pro service model, expanded associate training and have built out our job site delivery capabilities. We are building on this momentum with the recent launch of our new, incremental paint reward program for our MVPs Pro customers, in addition to the other meaningful rewards they have already received.  \n Within flooring, luxury vinyl was once again the top contributor as our consumers continue to prefer the low maintenance and stylish solutions that this product category has to offer. We also refreshed our STAINMASTER carpet lineup, continuing to reflect current styles and consumer preferences. And in late March, we launched our first extension of the STAINMASTER brand in tile. And right behind tile, we are launching new laminate and luxury vinyl products in STAINMASTER as well. We're excited to have the STAINMASTER brand within our portfolio and to extend its high-performance characteristics and stain-resistant warranty to these new product categories. With this new brand lineup, we are offering innovative and functional products for the home, all with a great value for our customers.  \n Now turning to building products. We continue to see broad-based strength across key Pro categories, including electrical, building materials, rough plumbing, millwork and lumber, driven by strong Pro demand and competitive in-stock positions. Building on last year's strong performance, we delivered a positive 38% 2-year comp in building products, which continues to reflect the persistent underlying strength in consumer demand for larger core home improvement projects and, to a lesser extent, commodity inflation.  \n Over the past several years, we have been focused on expanding our brand and product offerings to meet the needs of our Pro customers. In this quarter, we are excited about the introduction of Owens Corning new fiberglass rebar known as Pink bar. This Pro family product is stronger than traditional steel rebar and 7x lighter which makes it both easier for the Pro to work with and less costly to ship.  \n We are also excited to announce the national expansion of the APOC roof coating brand, which is a leading manufacturer in roofing and an important strategic partner to Lowe's. These new products and brands are strong additions to our outstanding Pro brand portfolio, which already includes other powerful brands like Bosch, Crescent, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, ITW, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Metabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.  \n Now looking at our performance in hardlines. As I mentioned earlier, our seasonal categories were impacted by delayed spring. As the weather has finally broken over the past few weeks, we have now seen higher demand across the seasonal categories. And it's important to remember that spring is always a first half event. And while this year's spring season has started slow, the teams are focused on delivering a successful spring again this year.  \n From the convenience and quality of the EGO, Kobalt, CRAFTSMAN and Skill brands with their zero-emission rechargeable equipment to our other leading brands such as John Deere, Honda, Husqvarna, Aaron's and CRAFTSMAN, we offer the products that our customers need to have the best-looking yard in the neighborhood. We are also continuing to expand our private brand lineup with new products in Origin 21, our new modern brand as well as our popular allen + roth brand, which is tailored to the more traditional taste.  \n SpringFest, which is our new approach to spring, is a multiweek event, and we leveraged several strategic promotions for popular spring items like mulch, soils and hanging baskets to deliver great value for our customers. And we are well positioned to capitalize on the late surge in spring demand, and I look forward to updating on this first half event on our second quarter call.  \n Now looking at Lowes.com. As Marvin mentioned, we saw a positive 2% sales growth in the quarter and over 39% positive growth on a 2-year basis. We continue to enhance the user experience on Lowes.com and our omnichannel capabilities, which is critical for consumers who increasingly expect flexibility and seamlessness in their shopping experience. Our new paint and countertop visualizers are driving better conversion rates and we also enabled our customers the ability to order bagged goods online for in-store pickup ahead of the spring season.  \n And as Marvin mentioned, our enhanced supply chain capabilities, including our expanded coastal holding facility network are now in place to enable us to flow product quickly to where it's needed as weather breaks across the country. And we continue to leverage our scale and carrier relationships to secure capacity and work to mitigate cost increases within our supply chain.  \n Before I close, I'd like to once again thank our vendor partners and our merchants for their hard work and dedication. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. No, I think, Brandon, I think you hit it. I think the key for us is making sure that we're focused on sell-through the seasonal buys that we've made. We shared with you during the fourth quarter call that we brought in some of the seasonal inventory ahead of the season. And so we're focused on working through that through the first half of the year. No, I think the only thing to add, Marvin, is that we're also seeing strength out of new and innovative product. And so you look at the strength of like the EGO brand and the battery-powered outdoor product just continuing to perform very well. The strength of John Deere, the strength of Aaron's in the riding mower segments doing very well. And as you touched on, as we saw green shoots of weather throughout the first quarter, we saw the strength in project -- outside project businesses like live nursery, like exterior Pro projects. So it just gives us good confidence that we can carry that through Q2. Yes, Liz, it's Bill. And so what we're seeing with product innovation, we really see it across the store, across every category. But in areas like appliances, you see customers trading up to smart appliances to better quality appliances. As I mentioned in an earlier question in response, battery outdoor power equipment with the EGO brand specifically. You're also seeing it in the likes of gas-powered outdoor power with John Deere and Aaron's, all innovative products there. You're seeing it in paint. So just really across the categories, you see innovation. \n And we're also able to offer that in our private brands with the introductions of STAINMASTER. So you're seeing that now start to weave its way in. I talked about -- it's already been in carpet and now you're seeing in tile, vinyl, laminate flooring. So you got Origin 21, which is a new modern brand for us, again, offers great innovation and great value."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their continued commitment to serving our customers, especially in this busy spring season. We are laser-focused on delivering a consistent and high-quality customer experience. At the same time, we have labor aligned to demand patterns so that we effectively managed our payroll this quarter even in a lower sales environment. The investments that we've made over the past several years and our enhanced labor management tools are clearly paying dividends as we flex labor across stores and departments so effectively that we continue to achieve strong customer satisfaction scores.  \n Also, the technology enhancements that we've made over the past several years enable our associates to spend 60% of their time serving customers and only 40% on manual tasking activities. As a reminder, as recently as 2018, 60% of all associated time was allocated on tasks that did not support the customer. We flipped this ratio by enabling more and more capabilities on our associates handheld mobile devices, which eliminated many time-consuming tasks. This is in addition to new technology that has enhanced our point-of-sale checkout, modernized project management, improved inventory visibility and digitized in-store pricing for appliances and lumber. This improved associate productivity has not only driven profitability, but it has also enhanced our customer service.  \n And we continue to unlock further productivity through our Perpetual Productivity Improvement or PPI initiatives. As a reminder, our PPI initiatives are not onetime efforts but rather a series of initiatives that are scaling across our stores over time, all of which contribute to operational efficiency as well as a culture of continuous improvement. As Marvin mentioned earlier, the success of our PPI initiatives contributed to our strong operating margin performance in Q1.  \n Now I would like to take a few minutes to discuss our strong Pro results in the first quarter when we launched our MVPs Pro Rewards and Partnership Program, which is centered around creating a business partnership with our Pro. We are really pleased to see the better-than-expected adoption rates for the new program and we expect to build on this momentum with the Pros as we launch enhanced features to the loyalty program in the coming months.  \n Through this program, we are also gaining valuable insight about our Pro customers that will enable us to better anticipate and meet their project needs through our Pro CRM platform and allow us to continue to expand our share of wallet with these valuable customers. And we're expanding our Pro fulfillment capabilities with our new Pro fulfillment center in Charlotte, where we are stocking the top SKUs that Pros consistently need in job lot quantities. As we pilot this new approach to Pro fulfillment, we are building on our existing job site delivery capabilities handled through our stores and Lowe's Pro supply branches today. Although we are pleased with our 600 basis points of growth in Pro penetration over the past 3 years, improving our fulfillment capabilities will allow us to accelerate this growth and continue to gain market share.  \n In addition to the success of our new Pro initiatives, I am pleased with our strides to become the employer of choice in retail. As a company, we are committed to investing in continuous learning and development throughout our associates careers through Lowe's University as well as a new debt-free education program that we just announced. Through this initiative, more than 300,000 associates are eligible to participate in over 50 academic programs free of charge. These programs are designed to help associates excel in their jobs today and built toward their future careers within Lowe's, including pathways into supply chain, logistics, data analytics, cybersecurity, technology and more.  \n Finally, I'm pleased to report that we are in a better position from a hiring and staffing standpoint than we were at this time last year. We accelerated our associate hiring process through new technology that dramatically reduce the time it takes process applications. These new tools ensure that we capture the best candidates in the pipeline and helped us staff up quickly for spring. Looking forward, we are making the right investments to continue to drive productivity while also enhancing our customer service, and we are well positioned to serve our customers to meet the surge in demand for spring products.  \n As I close, I would like to once again thank our store associates for their relentless focus on serving customers and driving productivities in our stores. \n With that, I will now turn it over to Brandon. Brian, I'll just add one additional comment there. If you look at our Pro growth that Marvin mentioned earlier at 20%, and then you look at the strength and the health of that Pro -- strong Pro market trends we're seeing, our revamped Lowe's Pro offering, the expanded Pro product that Bill mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, the deeper inventory and then the launch of our new MVP program. And so I think we've got good confidence in the underlying trends there. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Listen, from a payroll standpoint, I think it's important to think about the PPI initiatives as not just onetime initiatives, but ongoing initiatives. And so as we look at our ability to leverage SG&A through different initiatives, centralized RTVs and get down a whole list of the PPI initiatives. So this is not a onetime, but it's going to continue. And I think we've done it very effectively because both Pro and the do-it-yourself customer are showing increased LTR and service scores. So I think that just kind of points to some good productivity."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Lowe's Companies Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2024. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, comparable sales declined 6.2% as DIY customers continue to remain cautious with their home improvement spend and harsh weather impacted large parts of the U.S. in January. In spite of these challenges, I'm very pleased with the excellent customer service in our stores and strong operating profit performance for the quarter, driven by a disciplined focus on our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. \n Looking at the full fiscal year 2023, we delivered sales of $86.4 billion, adjusted operating margin of 13.3% and adjusted earnings per share of $13.09. \n Beginning with our DIY sales results. November and December trends improved from the third quarter, followed by a sharp drop in traffic during periods of extreme weather in January. Macroeconomic factors like persistent inflation and a stagnant housing market continue to make DIY customers and consumers hesitant to spend on big ticket purchases for their homes. And those who did engage in home improvement activities took on smaller, nondiscretionary projects with a heightened focus on value. This impacted demand for bigger ticket interior categories like kitchen and bath, flooring and appliances. \n In last quarter, we shifted our strategy to adapt to these changing consumer behaviors resulting in a record Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales and improved holiday sell-through and margins. While we're pleased to see these results, we're now focused on winning spring and we're excited to see how the customer responds to our more targeted traffic-driving marketing strategy and our lineup of great spring products at an outstanding value. Bill will provide more detail on our compelling product assortment for spring later in the call. \n Amongst the most exciting changes for this spring is our new DIY loyalty program that we announced in January. This first-of-its-kind rewards program designed for DIY customers gives these value-focused homeowners more reasons to choose Lowe's. In a marketplace where nearly all DIY home improvement customers shop multiple retailers, MyLowe's Rewards loyalty program is designed to get these DIY customers to choose Lowe's over other retail competitors for the home improvement needs. We expect this to drive traffic and return visits while also enabling us to personalize offers and experiences for our loyalty members, creating a flywheel effect that increases DIY loyalty and demand over time, both in-store and online. MyLowe's Rewards will be available nationwide in March just in time for spring making Lowe's the only national home improvement retailer with a distinct loyalty offering for both Pro and DIY customers. \n Now moving to Pro. Despite a challenging macro environment and difficult weather in January, our comparable Pro sales were flat for the quarter. As a reminder, our core Pro customer is a small- to medium-sized business owner. And in our recent Pro survey, these customers told us their backlogs are in line with last year, and they are cautiously optimistic about their ability to generate and close leads in 2024. We remain focused on executing our holistic Pro strategy with more convenient fulfillment options and enhanced product assortment, creating a best-in-class digital experience and a rewards program that incentivizes long-term loyalty. As these investments scale and mature, they will increasingly save Pros time and money, enabling us to earn more of their business as we aim to grow Pro at 2x the market rate. \n Now turning to online. Comparable sales were flat for the quarter, and we're pleased to see higher conversion rates and lower returns, a positive indicator that customers are responding to our faster fulfillment and improved digital experience. Our talented technology team remains focused on developing a best-in-class omnichannel experience to seamlessly serve our multigenerational customer base, including co-creating innovative customer solutions with world-class technology companies like our immersive kitchen design app for Apple's new Vision Pro headset and using generative AI to improve how we sell, shop and work like our home improvement ChatGPT plug-in. \n Now let's transition to our view to macro. As we look forward, many of you are asking when we expect home improvement demand to inflect? Although it's a very fair question, unfortunately, it's still very difficult to predict. And while there is increased confidence of a soft landing, there's still a lot of speculation on the timing of anticipated interest rate cuts in the pace of slowing inflation. It's also unclear how quickly the consumer will react to these changes and how quickly their spending habits will change. Overall, the consumer is financially healthy. But in this post-pandemic time frame, customers are still showing a preference of spending on services with elevated demand for travel, restaurants and other experiences. And while we anticipate these trends will normalize, the timing is uncertain. \n Also, existing home sales are at levels we've not seen in almost 30 years. And even as mortgage rates decline, 2/3 of homeowners remain locked in at rates below 4%, which may keep many on the sidelines. Due to these factors, we expect DIY demand to remain under pressure, and Brandon will provide more detail on our 2024 expectations later in the call. However, we're very confident in our strategic plan and in our ability to execute at a high level in a multitude of economic environments. \n Despite near-term uncertainty, let me remind you why we remain bullish on the medium- and long-term outlook for home improvement. The 3 core demand drivers of our business, disposable personal income, home price appreciation and the age of housing stock remain supportive. When you pair these factors with trends like chronic undersupply of homes, millennial household formation, baby boomers aging in place and a sustained number of people working from home, you can see why we are confident that home improvement demand will trend upwards over time across both homeowners and Pros. \n And in the meantime, we're focused on controlling what we control, and making the right investments in our Total Home Strategy to modernize our supply chain and IT infrastructure, localize and improve our merchandising assortments, rolling out a Pro and DIY loyalty program, continuing to elevate our store environment and developing a best-in-class digital and omnichannel experience. All of these investments in our Total Home Strategy will position Lowe's to win in the short run and set us up for strong sales and profit growth when the home improvement market recovers. \n Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our hard-working associates for their commitment to serving customers. In recognition of their dedication, we awarded our frontline associates with an end-of-year discretionary bonus of $140 million. This is our way of saying thank you to hourly associates and assistant managers who serve our customers and make our communities better. As I travel across the country visiting stores and conducting town halls to hear directly from our frontline associates, I'm consistently humbled by their passion, commitment and their expertise. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. While softer DIY demand trends continued this quarter, we remain focused on highlighting value and convenience, both in our stores and online to a price-conscious consumer, all while maintaining a balanced focus on profitability. We are also staying committed to serving a resilient Pro, which resulted in flat Pro comps as we continue to enhance our Pro product and service offering. \n Beginning with building products. This was our best performing area with positive comps in Building Materials. This strength was fueled by an increased demand for roofing and drywall, combined with improved fulfillment capabilities and in-stock positions to better serve our Pro customers. Throughout the quarter, we continued to launch additional Klein products across our stores, bringing the #1 tool brand for electrical and HVAC professionals back to Lowe's. We now have the largest assortment of Klein tools in the home improvement retail channel with initial sales exceeding our expectations across electrical, hand tools and stackable tool storage. Throughout the store, we continue to introduce new and innovative products to Lowe's, like Pella's hidden screen windows. This new window includes a built-in screen that appears when the window is open, but hides away when it's closed. \n Turning to home decor. This division was significantly impacted by softer DIY demand in bigger ticket interior categories like kitchens and bath, flooring and appliances. This past quarter, we pivoted our go-to-market strategy to be more responsive to a shift in shopping trends, like the appliance consumers' increasing preference for a single unit purchase and their search for the best deal. While these actions pressured our average selling price as expected, this approach was a major contributor to our successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday events. \n And while some consumers remain budget conscious, we are seeing others trade up for innovation, which we continue to offer across all major appliance categories. A great example is our exclusive LG smart refrigerator, which has a double freezer and also makes the popular slow melting craft ice. This product is consistently a top seller despite retailing for over $2,500. This type of innovation adds to our already industry-leading assortment in appliances, including high-quality brands like Bosch, Miele, LG, Samsung and KitchenAid, and we are continuing to help our customers see the value and attainability of trading up for affordable premium features. \n Paint is another category where we've seen product innovation resonate like our exclusive line of Spec Right paint designed for Pros who paint. Beyond gaining traction with Pros, we saw strong exterior paint demand before the weather turned colder in January, which gives us confidence we have the right offering in place as spring arrives. We also recently completed the rollout of our upgraded paint department, which converted our color wall to trusted Sherwood-William Colors and improve the shopping experience to make it easier for our customers to grab the higher-margin attachment items they need to complete their paint projects. \n Turning to our results and hardlines. This is another area where we quickly adjusted to the changing consumer buying patterns, which was reflected in our improved holiday sell-through and profitability. We are also encouraged that our new rural assortments continue to resonate across the country with strength in apparel, pet and automotive as consumers respond to the products and brands. We also recently launched a new partnership with Sunrun, the market leader in home solar and battery installation. This partnership now enhances our services offering for consumers looking to power their homes with renewable energy. \n Lowe's is the go-to destination for homeowners in spring. And as we enter our biggest season of the year, we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on this demand. As Marvin mentioned, we are excited about our product lineup. The launch of Toro builds on our industry-leading outdoor power equipment lineup alongside John Deere, Aaron's, EGO, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Kobalt and SKIL, our outdoor power equipment assortment is unmatched in home improvement, which is reflected in our continued market leadership in this space. I'm also excited about our new patio sets from our private brands, allen + roth and Origin 21, which enables homeowners to update their outdoor spaces for spring with trending styles across multiple price points. \n And if consumers don't see the color they're looking for on our sales floor, they can easily shop the extended aisle with associates now able to tender the purchase directly on their mobile smart devices. The merchants in our seasonal businesses are also bringing customers innovation and functionality at more competitive prices like our new exclusive Char-Broil grill lineup, which lets grillers switch from a traditional grill to a griddle in seconds or the fast-growing Blackstone brand of grills that continues to bring new features and value to the market. \n Beyond our compelling seasonal assortment and strong in-stock position, I'm also looking forward to launching our enhanced marketing strategy for spring. This season, we are taking a more sophisticated tech-enabled advertising approach and we will be featuring traffic-driving events that will motivate homeowners to get started on their spring projects at Lowe's. \n We are also leaning into live sports with an expanded NFL relationship and leveraging our popular commercials featuring Lowe's home team players trying their hands at DIY projects. We are extremely pleased with the success of this season's home team players with 2 members of the Lowe's team, Travis Kelce and Christian McCaffrey, both participating in Super Bowl 58 while being featured in our commercials. \n Shifting gears to merchandising productivity. Our team is making tremendous progress on our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives, which, as we planned, are offsetting the cost of our supply chain and Pro investments. As a reminder, the PPI initiatives that I outlined at our analyst and investor conference include expanding our private brand penetration, improving inventory productivity, maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing and promotions, scaling our retail media network and closely managing product costs. \n Over the past year, we have been working closely with our vendor partners to claw back some of the cost increases we absorbed during periods of exceptionally high inflation. And now that raw material and transportation costs are normalizing. Our best-in-class cost optimization tool gives us robust data down to the item level that allows us to take a calculated surgical approach, helping guide us to reducing costs across our portfolio. As we work to recoup these costs with our suppliers, we are reinvesting those savings into our marketing and merchandising strategies to drive traffic and sales. \n As I close, I'd like to thank our vendors and merchants for their unwavering focus on delivering value to our shared customers and for putting us in a strong position to win spring. \n I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking our frontline team for their relentless focus and execution this quarter. Their efforts to serve our customers while tightly managing controllable expenses once again resulted in improved customer service scores and strong operating profit performance despite slower sales. Customer satisfaction scores were up 200 basis points this quarter versus last year with improvements in both Pro and DIY, reflecting the hard work of our frontline associates combined with improved omnichannel fulfillment capabilities. In fact, this year, omni score has improved almost 25% since 2020. Customers have new functionality like two-way texting, where they can be notified in advance to confirm their delivery date as well as same-day delivery options through our gig network. They can also use our new self-service functionality to track their order status and resolve issues directly, all without needing to call a store. \n In addition to expanding our fulfillment options and improving how we communicate with our customers, we're also enhancing the BOPIS or buy online, pickup in store experience through our new front-end configuration. We completed over 450 front-end rollouts this year with over 500 planned for 2024. Customers are embracing the new front-end experience, telling us they appreciate the faster and easier checkout process. This new front-end configuration also keeps sales associates in the aisles helping customers instead of needing to assist with checkout process when lines get long. \n While we are improving the front end of our stores, we are also making strides on the back end with our ongoing freight flow transformation. We are further improving our freight flow process with distribution centers now adding new labels that are linked to each store's layout. These labels provide our store teams a direction of exactly where to place the product on the sales floor once the freight is removed from receiving. These enhancements will make it quicker and easier for associates to get products onto the floor and cross merchandise attachments and will drive better in-stocks for our customers and improve payroll productivity for our stores. These new capabilities and improved processes are all part of our ongoing perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives, which both improve the customer experience and drive profitability. \n Turning to our efforts to become the employer of choice in retail. I am really pleased with the progress we've made. Last quarter, we saw a record response rate to our annual associate engagement survey with 90%-plus participation. And even more importantly, scores improved significantly across 3 areas that we measure; engagement, leadership effectiveness and inclusion. It's clear that better associate engagement leads to lower turnover and directly translates into better business results with a workforce more focused on serving our customers and driving productivity in our operations. \n As Marvin mentioned, we announced $140 million in discretionary bonuses this quarter. This includes an incremental $5,000 for our assistant store managers and other frontline supervisors as well as our special discretionary bonus of $400 for full-time hourly associates and $200 for part-time hourly associates. Additionally, since 2018, we have invested over $3.5 billion in incremental wage and share-based compensation for our frontline associates. In fact, we are one of the few retailers to award stock grants to our store managers and assistant store managers so they share in our long-term success. These programs for our store leaders are not new. In fact, store managers have been receiving share-based compensation for decades and assistant store managers since 2019. We are also creating opportunities for advancement for our associates to encourage them to build their careers with Lowe's. \n Since 2018, we have added over 10,000 new department supervisors and over 2,500 new assistant store managers. And through Lowe's University, we are training and developing our associates for their next role. This year, we're extending our advanced leadership training to our assistant store managers to equip them with the tools they need to succeed as they move up in their career. With these enhancements, we've worked to increase the number of store managers promoted from ASM to over 80% over the past 3 years. In fact, more than 80% of our leadership roles are now built from within. \n All of these investments have led to one of the best spring staffing levels in many years, and the stores are ready to serve our customers this spring. We are very excited about the new MyLowe's Rewards DIY loyalty program and the great spring merchandise lineup Bill outlined. As I close, I would like to once again thank all of our store associates for their hard work and dedication. \n Now I'll turn it over to Brandon. \nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Joe. Let me begin with our Q4 results. We generated diluted earnings per share of $1.77. As a reminder, in the prior year, we recognized $441 million of pretax transaction costs associated with the sale of the Canadian retail business. My comments from this point forward will include comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures from last year where applicable. Q4 sales were $18.6 billion. \n Of note, prior year sales included $958 million generated in our Canadian retail business and approximately $1.4 billion related to the additional 53rd week. Also, Q4 results reflect approximately $200 million in sales headwind due to the related shift in our fiscal calendar. Comp sales were down 6.2%, driven by continued pressure in DIY bigger ticket spending and unfavorable January winter weather. Lumber deflation did not have a material impact on comp sales. Although the calendar shift pressured total sales growth in Q4, it had no impact on comparable sales as comps are calculated based on weeks 41 to 53 in fiscal 2022. \n Comparable average ticket was down 0.1% to prior year. Continued ticket growth in many Pro-heavy categories offset appliance pricing pressure and lower DIY bigger ticket sales. Comp transactions declined 6.1%, driven by the DIY slowdown in unfavorable January winter weather impacting traffic. Our monthly comps were down 4.8% in November and 6.6% in December. January comps declined 7.4% as we experienced significant pressure during weeks of unfavorable winter weather. \n Gross margin was 32.4% of sales in the fourth quarter, up 7 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from multiple PPI initiatives as well as favorable product mix and lower transportation costs. These benefits were somewhat offset by supply chain expansion costs. SG&A of 20.9% of sales delevered 5 basis points versus prior year adjusted SG&A as the momentum we continue to build with our PPI initiatives across all functional areas of the company largely offset sales volume deleverage. \n Operating margin rate of 9.1% declined 48 basis points versus prior year adjusted operating margin. The effective tax rate was 23.8%, in line with prior year adjusted effective tax rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $16.9 billion, $1.6 billion lower than the prior year quarter as we invest in high-velocity Pro SKUs while managing replenishment in line with sales trends and improving the flow of spring product builds through our supply chain. As a reminder, prior year inventory excluded Canadian operations as the sale was complete before year-end. \n Now turning to capital allocation. In 2023, we generated $6.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $8.9 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. During the fourth quarter, we paid $632 million in dividends at $1.10 per share and repurchased 1.9 million shares for $404 million returning over $1 billion to our shareholders. Capital expenditures totaled $620 million in Q4 as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives to drive growth and profitability. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR finished the year at 2.81x. And lastly, we delivered a return on invested capital above 36% for the year. \n Now I would like to discuss our 2024 outlook. As Marvin mentioned, we are bullish on the medium- to long-term outlook for the home improvement industry, but the near-term macro backdrop remains uncertain. There is optimism around potential interest rate cuts and improved consumer sentiment. However, the timing of Fed actions remains unclear, and there can be a lag before monetary policy impacts the consumer. Also housing turnover remains depressed and the consumer is still showing a greater preference for spending on services rather than goods. \n We are expecting these factors to continue to pressure home improvement spending in 2024, especially for the DIY. And with that in mind, we are expecting sales ranging from $84 billion to $85 billion and comparable sales declines in a range of 2% to 3%. Pro sales should continue to outpace DIY as we leverage our multiyear strategy to improve product offerings, fulfillment options in the in-store and digital shopping experience to drive Pro growth at 2x the market rate. We expect operating margin in the range of 12.6% to 12.7%. \n When we bridge our 2023 operating margin to our 2024 expectations, there are a couple of points to keep in mind. First, the impact of sales volume deleverage and second, the cycling of a favorable legal settlement in each of the first 2 quarters. These pressures are partly offset by the expected positive impact of our ongoing enterprise-wide PPI initiatives. We have made significant progress in realizing our productivity goals over the past few years, and we remain laser-focused on driving these PPI efforts and closely managing expenses through this tough sales environment. These expectations result in full year earnings per share of approximately $12 to $12.30. \n Now to assist you with your modeling, I'd like to take a moment and provide some color on the cadence of our expected results for the year. As a reminder, the steep pullback in DIY demand, which intensified in the third quarter of 2023 sets us up for different compares in the first and second half of this year. Given this, we expect first half comp sales to remain under pressure as the current DIY demand trends continue. But as we move into the second half, we expect comp sales to improve as we begin to cycle over the pullback in the third quarter. \n To be clear, we are not forecasting an improvement in demand trends this year. Rather, the compares are easier in the second half. And while we are planning for a normal spring season, the timing of spring is unpredictable and always brings some variability to our first half performance. Given our customer mix, these DIY drivers disproportionately impact our business. Now more specific to our first quarter, we expect comp sales to be consistent with our fourth quarter results approximately 300 basis points below the bottom of our full year guide. The combination of lower sales volumes as well as cycling a sizable legal settlement is expected to result in a Q1 operating margin rate approximately 200 basis points below the prior year adjusted rate. \n Before I close, let me remind you of our capital allocation strategy, which remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business with capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. Next, we continue to target a 35% dividend payout ratio. We also plan to use our free cash flow to repay a $450 million bond maturity and then return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. \n In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute through the near-term market uncertainty and remain focused on realizing the benefits of our total home strategy while continuing to drive sustainable shareholder value. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: First one would be just around the sensitivity of your margin forecast, if comps end up trending below that 2% to 3% range for the year, and then alternatively, as you think perhaps longer term, as comps swing positive, just what types of incrementals do you think you could achieve on that, given that you've been pretty lean on the expense front here given the current environment. That's my first question. \nBrandon Sink: Peter, sure, this is Brandon. In terms of incremental, decremental, we've established essentially a flow-through rule of thumb. If our sales do exceed the top end of our guide, we do expect about 10 basis points for every 1% of incremental comp sales on the high side. And then on the low side, sales fall below the bottom end. We're looking at about 15 basis points of margin contraction for every point of comp decline. So high level, that's more of a rule of thumb on an annual basis. It doesn't necessarily work in terms of quarterly performance. \n And the other thing I'll stress is the plus 10 and minus 15, not necessarily natural output. So I would tell you that the model and the algorithm very contingent on us continuing to drive PPI across all functions, and that's what's contemplated on both the upside and the downside. \nPeter Benedict: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, just around -- I mean, you've had success with your cost optimization efforts. Just kind of your view on where you stand with those, how much more is left to go? And how that kind of plays into maybe your view of average ticket versus traffic in '24. Do you think you can hold on to the ticket in '24, given all the dynamics out there and you're clawing back some costs? Do you think you'll reinvest and maybe tickets down. Just curious how you see that interplaying in '24? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Peter, I think to your first question on just our ability to manage costs. We're really pleased with our ability to manage expenses here in the last couple of years through this downturn. We have a robust and evolving road map of PPI initiatives. We were down comps 4.7% this year, expecting down at the midpoint, 2.5%. So our ability to manage the sales deleverage there with that robust pipeline. Again, really pleased there. And as we look out, a number of initiatives you heard from Joe and Bill that we continue to be excited about. We believe in '24 in particular, that PPI is going to enable us to offset over $400 million of wage pressure, inflationary pressure and strategic investments. \n I think the second part of your question, just as we think about ticket into 2024, we are expecting that to hold up, and that's largely what we saw in 2023. The pullback is expected again in transactions. And really, the drivers of that Pro growth positively impacting average ticket more from a mix standpoint.\n And then on the pressure point side, we're continuing to see the DIY bigger ticket pressure, and that's going to continue to be a drag. We don't expect any significant improvement off of that second half 2023 run rate. And then on appliances, specifically, ASP pressure is expected to continue as we return to more of a pre-pandemic environment. But overall, as we cycle into the second half of the year, we are expecting a more normal historical relationship between average ticket and transactions. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. \nZachary Fadem: I know there's a lot of moving pieces on the SG&A line as you lap the legal settlement and some of the incentive comp dynamics. So is there any way you could bridge all the puts and takes in a little bit more detail from the 13.3% operating margin in '23 to your 12.6%, 12.7% in '24? And also, any color on gross margin versus SG&A? \nBrandon Sink: Zack, this is Brandon. I would say on SG&A, it's really 2 themes and it's the cycling of the settlements and its deleverage on lower sales. And when you look at the midpoint of the range, a step back about 65 basis points, it breaks down about half and half there. So those are really as we look at managing SG&A in '24. Those are the pressure points.\n You mentioned incentive compensation. We paid a discretionary bonus in Q4 of $140 million, which offset any previously expected Q4 benefit that we had from lower management incentive comp, and we're pleased that we were able to reward our frontline associates. But what that resulted in for the full year '23, we had the benefit from lower management incentive comp based on performance. That was offset by the discretionary frontline bonuses that we paid in Q2 and Q4. So that really does not create a headwind for us as we bridge '23 to '24. So back to the 2 themes, it's mainly the cycling of the legal settlements and the deleverage on lower sales. \nZachary Fadem: Got you. And then two more quick ones. Just any color on gross margin. And then second, your Pro comps were slightly positive in '23 by my math and outcomping DIY for a few years now. So curious if you could just talk about DIY versus Pro mix today and if it's still in that 75%, 25% range? \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Zack. Sorry, I forgot your gross margin question. So I'll take that one. I'll toss it to Marvin for Pro. So we're expecting gross margins for '24 to be roughly flat. And the gross margin themes are really similar to what we saw here in 2023. Ongoing supply chain investment pressure as we wrap the rollout of market delivery. We're continuing to make investments in Pro fulfillment, but those pressures are being offset by ongoing PPI initiatives that Bill discussed as we manage product costs, lower transportation, continue to expect private brands. So those are the puts and takes from a gross margin standpoint. And on Pro, I'll toss it to you, Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. So on the mix, that's directionally correct on the percentages. And look, we feel good about the resilience of our Pro customer. And as a reminder, our customers are small to medium sized business owner, and we're actually pleased with the survey results where they feel confident that they can build, the backlog is consistent with what they saw last year and that they can continue to drive their business. \n And again, they're cautiously optimistic based on what they know, but that gives us confidence that the things we're doing around loyalty, around product assortment expansion, around service levels, our digital platform and how we've dramatically improved that. And we think we have a best-in-class experience is resonating. And relative to the DIY, I mean we equally feel good about the level of execution in that business. I mean we view it as probably as a macro issue versus a strategic issue or any type of an execution issue. \n As Brandon I both said in our prepared comments, when we think about the medium to long term, we're very bullish because we've made tremendous investments in this business across supply chain, IT infrastructure, omnichannel, localization, assortment planning, space productivity, store environment and service levels that we know are going to pay dividends, not only in the short run while we deal with this macroeconomic headwind, but when the market recovers, we think we're perfectly positioned to grow and take market share. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Marvin, your answer just now touched on this a bit. I wanted to put it out here. There's this perception or even misperception that the way that Lowe's expenses have been so well managed could either impact how much sales can grow and the cycle resumes or how much EPS grows if you have to put more SG&A back into the business. So I'm curious if you can comment on that. \nMarvin Ellison: No, look, it's a fair question. I think the best way for me to answer would be our customer service results. And when you look at the fact that we have improvements in both Pro and DIY, 200 basis points for both. That gives you an indication that our service levels remain extremely high and also gives you an understanding of the power of our PPI initiatives because a lot of our expense takeout is not the traditional cut payroll, it is more about the investments of technology that drives productivity that allows us to add more hours to driving service and selling and taking hours out of tasking. \n And Joe has talked about this for 5 years. We're trying to build a model where we invest technology and we drive productivity that allows us to have more customer-facing associates and less tasking. So we believe that our activity-based staffing model puts us in a great position that when sales go up, we invest a payroll based on the activity driven to create the sales. And when sales come down, we have an activity-based system that we think is best-in-class that we can take hours out based on department level day and hour that we think will drive the business from a productivity standpoint, but without hindering service. So we feel good about the whole model, and we don't think there's any negative implications of sales going up and SG&A not being able to be managed as tightly and as efficiently as we've managed in the last couple of years. \nJoseph McFarland: And Simeon, let me give you a quick example. If you think about 5 years ago, we had less than 50% of the stores that actually had self-checkout. And so over the last 5 years, we've mentioned we've developed our own internal self-checkout built with the home improvement customer in mind. We now have that complete across the entire chain. And now we have started our front-end transformation in adding incremental assisted self-checkouts, and we have 400 stores complete. This has also allowed us to roll out a best-in-class loyalty program for the DIY customer that is tied right in with our mobile technology. And so as we look to complete the incremental 500 in 2024. And then I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our back-end initiatives, too. So very confident in the activity-based labor model and the PPI initiatives we continue to focus on. \nMarvin Ellison: One last point. I mean that's just one example of many initiatives that Brandon and I both have on our time line that we've yet to develop and yet to implement. So this is an ongoing process that is alive and well in every function, including merchandising, as Bill outlined in his prepared comments. \nSimeon Gutman: The follow-up is on the cycle. I think in some models, the weakest part of the cycle would have been the second half of '23 and even the first half of '24. And maybe the market was kind of looking for light a little bit sooner. I can't tell if that was your base case as well. It seems like the market is more dependent on existing home sales. And then Marvin, you mentioned in the prepared comments that it is a big question of whether or not we get back to something normal. And I'm curious when things start up again, do we get back to normal? Or is it something that's less than normal? \nMarvin Ellison: I'll give you my perspective, Simeon, and I'll let Brandon provide any additional comments. When you think about the cadence of our comp sales for this year, as Brandon mentioned, is more indicative of year-over-year comparison versus our forecast that the market is going to improve at some point this year. We hope that it improves and we are positioning ourselves that when that happens, we think that we will have outsized top and bottom line growth. But our perspective of 2024 is that we're going to feel this DIY pressure throughout the year and we're going to perform at a high level irrespective of kind of what type of macro environment that we're dealing with. I'll let Brandon add any additional comments. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, I would just say, Simeon, you mentioned the base case. I mean our base case guide assumes no change in macro conditions versus what we've experienced here the last couple of quarters. It's unclear is the timing of the rate cuts, the improvements in home improvement share of wallet. Marvin mentioned housing turnover, consumer sentiment. So sort of more of the same philosophy there. And even when we start to see some green shoots there, it's going to be -- the trends are going to improve. There is an expected lag before the macro drivers we believe are going to translate into spending. So those have been the underpinnings, the assumptions that we've made here for 2024. And again, the improvement is just a function of what we're cycling in the second half versus our views on the macro and the timing of any improvement. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So two related questions, a follow-up on the demand environment. First, did you see a -- do you think weather was a net headwind in the fourth quarter? Obviously, December was warmer year-over-year and that probably helped areas like outdoor paint. But then January is much colder, and you have a much more southern geography and it seemed to impact that part of the country more. So do you think weather was actually a net headwind over the quarter? Or was it more neutral when you think about the December side? \n And then, Brandon, you mentioned green shoots on share of wallet. Did you see anything in the holiday period that would suggest that, that share of wallet pull forward is at least starting to move past due but maybe not moving towards the more positive side? \nBrandon Sink: Chris, let me -- I'll hit the weather things first, and it really was just a January winter -- extreme winter weather story impacted January as we sized at about 200 basis points of impact on the month. It had an outsized impact on our Pro business over those weeks. The other weather theme also just to mention is we've cycled 2 straight years of hurricane recovery with Ian and Ida, it's about 150 basis point comp impact to Q4, just cycling that. But again, that was all baked into our expectations. And in terms of just what we saw through the holiday season, I'll actually toss it over to Bill, and he can give a view on what we saw in terms of consumer behavior there. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Chris, I think for the holiday, we saw -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw record holiday sales. We saw the consumer respond very favorably to our trim and tree program and saw a nice performance there. We also saw, as you mentioned, December was warmer. And so we saw those outdoor businesses perform both on the Pro side as well as on the DIY side as the consumer continued to take on outdoor projects. As we've rolled into February and get started with 2024, as we begin to start our spring program for the South and Deep South, we're starting to see some of those early signs of spring where the weather is warmer, we're starting to get started with some of those spring-related businesses. So where we've got some warm weather, we're starting to see some of those early signs of spring. So we're excited about that. \nChristopher Horvers: And then my follow-up is on the appliance category. It did track below, I think, your overall comp, you mentioned ASP pressures as you're leaning to the assortment more to the value side. Do you think -- how are you looking at your performance relative to the market? I don't know if you track line or something gives you sort of unit demand performance relative to the market. But it's your largest category. And obviously, you have a leading assortment and footprint in the store. So how do you think you're performing on the share side? \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. So for the year, we saw share growth in appliances. For the quarter, we saw unit growth across all the major categories. We did see average selling price pressure as we called out. For the key major events, both Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw a nice performance across those holiday weeks, and we're pleased with that. We did see the consumer pivot. And we met them where they wanted to go, and that was a shift from multiunit purchases to a single unit purchase as the consumer was looking for that. \n We also see the consumer moving to kind of two spectrums. We're seeing them look for value, so looking for products in that value conscious, and we're also seeing them trade up and finding innovation, and I'll share two examples. They'll look for entry-level laundry, for example, and then they're not afraid to invest in, for example, the GE Profile all-in-one washer dryer combination that retails for over $2,500 of which we could sell every single one that we can get our hands on. So those are just 2 spectrums of what's going on in that business. And it's happening across really all categories of the appliance business. So it's really 2 spectrums of what's going on.\n We're continuing to see our online appliance business perform very well as that business continues to evolve, and we're continuing to build out our capabilities there to make sure that we're meeting the customer where they want to be met and those fulfillment capabilities and delivery. And as Joe talked about, with two-way text and market delivery and getting all those capabilities rolled out so that we can fulfill the way we want to fulfill. \nMarvin Ellison: And Chris, this is Marvin. Just one last point on appliances. The work of our market delivery supply chain infrastructure is going to be significant, not only in 2024, but for years to come. I mean, we're virtually the only national player that can deliver major appliances next day and two-day in virtually every zip code in the country. And that's significant in addition to having same-day capacity for customers to have emergency purchases we still have take-with inventory in virtually every store where a customer can come in and literally leave with an appliance within the hour. And so our model is difficult, if not impossible, to replicate in the brands that Bill and his team have brought to our assortment is something that we think will continue to work for us. And look, we'll work and manage through the macro environment. And I think Bill and his team have done a really nice job, and we'll continue to listen to the consumer and pivot based on where they want us to go. \nOperator: Our question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: You mentioned big ticket still stays under pressure in DIY. And we wondered if we could try and get our arms around that a little bit more in terms of how it compares the mix of what you were seeing prepandemic in terms of smaller versus larger projects. And that also -- that question goes to the Pro as well within the backlog. It sounds like you're seeing a stable backlog. But what are you seeing in terms of percentage of mix when it comes to those big ticket versus smaller ticket? \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. Kate, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part, and I'll let Bill or Joe jump in on the second part. But if you think about the DIY consumer for a second, the consumer is healthy and we feel good about the financial wherewithal of that consumer. They're simply choosing to leverage their spend in different places. As we've discussed and is not just us, but in all the different companies that talk about consumer spending, customers are just spending more of their wallet on experiences, on travel, on concerts, on restaurants because of this whole post-COVID relationship of getting back out and getting back to normal. \n And also, I don't think is a surprise for us to say that customers purchased quite a few home-related goods during the pandemic. So we're still working through that cycle. Having said that, we believe that we will work our way out of this macro environment at some point. We're not trying to call the timing on it. Our objective is to continue to invest in our business and execute at a high level. So whenever that consumer spend reverts back to normal, we're going to be in a perfect position to take advantage of it.\n One of the reasons why we launched our DIY loyalty program is specifically for the DIY consumer to give them some level of rationale to choose us over someone else and to create a level of differentiation in the marketplace, both in-store and online, so that we can be a preference for the DIY consumer. And so as we think about what they're buying and where we think that big ticket is going, I think it remains to be seen, but we feel good about what we're positioning for those consumers, and we'll wait on whatever time frame occurs with them to change their spending habits. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Kate, I would just add that it really varies by product category. And so as I said, with appliances, you've got really two spectrums going. You've got the value-conscious consumer looking at low-end pricing all the way to innovation, and we meet the customer across a variety of price points. And then you have the Pro looking at their jobs, and we can meet them wherever they want to be met, whether that's on stock cabinets and having those products in our stores again across a multitude of price points that we offer in our stores and the different levels of product quality of product that we offer both online and in-store.\n And as we get ready for spring, we have a lot of new product that we're excited about. And so you think about bigger ticket product like riding lawn mowers, walk-behind mowers, the launch of Toro, it's bigger ticket product. We're excited about that. And those are all new. And so same thing with patio furnitures, we introduced Origin 21. We introduced the allen + roth program. Those are bigger ticket products as she's looking to address and upgrade their outdoor spaces. So again, we want to meet her wherever she wants to be met. We want to be able to offer a variety of pricing to her based on how she wants to be met as she takes on these projects. And that's what we're trying to do, both online and in-store. \n And we're excited about the readiness. We've worked really hard with our assortments that we offer both online and in-store. We've worked really hard to make sure that we've got these variations across the country so that we're localized to address those needs across the different areas and geographies of our stores, and we're ready. We're ready for mother nature to cooperate and we're ready to get going. So with that, Rob, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: The final question will be from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. \nSteven Zaccone: Brandon, I wanted to just circle back to the same-store sales guidance. And I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about that second half outlook in particular because it does embed a pretty big improvement on a 1-year basis and then also on a multiyear basis, from stacks perspective. So maybe just flesh out a bit what's really driving the improvement? Because you could arguably say that's not conservative in one view. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Steve. Really, just when we look at the cadence of comps, I'm going to reaffirm my earlier comment, we expect the macro pressures, inflation, higher interest rates, low housing turnover to persist. When we looked specifically at the second half, we're cycling the easier compares as we comp over the DIY weakness that intensified in particular in Q3 of last year. And to be clear, our comp improvement in the second half is not a result of any views on the improving macro, but purely are reflective of easier year-over-year comparison. So we looked at the cadence. We looked at it a lot of different ways. I would tell you on a 2-year basis, which we leaned into pretty hard 2-year ex lumber, there's a pretty consistent trajectory as we moved across the year. So we feel really comfortable with the full year, the breakdown, the comps and the operating margin and wanted to provide the right level of transparency and visibility to that. \nSteven Zaccone: Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up I had is just on the rural framework. Is there anything that's new this year as you think about the opportunity? And then when you think about the store portfolio more broadly, one of your peers has shifted to opening stores, would you consider being a net opener of stores at some point in the future? \nMarvin Ellison: This is Marvin. I'll take that final part of your question. So on the new store openings, it's -- we're going to always look for what we describe as real estate voids around different parts of the country where we believe that we can get the right return on our capital for new store investment. But candidly, I mean, our focus is on space productivity. We have such incredible upside opportunities in our stores to just invest capital in our existing infrastructure and create space productivity. We think the return on invested capital is significantly greater in using our dollars for that versus opening new stores with expensive real estate, where we're struggling to get those investments to pencil. And again, we'll open a handful of stores for voids where you're going to see us spend a ton of time on driving space productivity and creating greater value from the assets that we already own. And that's going to be our key focus. \n Relative to rural, we're extremely pleased with the performance of those 300-plus stores when you think about categories like pet, things like clothing and automotive, they're positive performing, outperformed the company and most other merchandising categories. And you're going to see us start to expand some of those rural categories in nonrural locations around the country. We wanted to make sure that we learned enough about the consumer demand, enough about how we serve customers well and Bill and Joe and their teams have done an exceptional job. And so you're going to hear us continue to talk about this, but it's something that we're very pleased with. And you'll start to see it show up in more places around the portfolio of our stores. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May. \nOperator: This concludes Lowe's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brandon Sink",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Let me begin with our Q4 results. We generated diluted earnings per share of $1.77. As a reminder, in the prior year, we recognized $441 million of pretax transaction costs associated with the sale of the Canadian retail business. My comments from this point forward will include comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures from last year where applicable. Q4 sales were $18.6 billion. \n Of note, prior year sales included $958 million generated in our Canadian retail business and approximately $1.4 billion related to the additional 53rd week. Also, Q4 results reflect approximately $200 million in sales headwind due to the related shift in our fiscal calendar. Comp sales were down 6.2%, driven by continued pressure in DIY bigger ticket spending and unfavorable January winter weather. Lumber deflation did not have a material impact on comp sales. Although the calendar shift pressured total sales growth in Q4, it had no impact on comparable sales as comps are calculated based on weeks 41 to 53 in fiscal 2022. \n Comparable average ticket was down 0.1% to prior year. Continued ticket growth in many Pro-heavy categories offset appliance pricing pressure and lower DIY bigger ticket sales. Comp transactions declined 6.1%, driven by the DIY slowdown in unfavorable January winter weather impacting traffic. Our monthly comps were down 4.8% in November and 6.6% in December. January comps declined 7.4% as we experienced significant pressure during weeks of unfavorable winter weather. \n Gross margin was 32.4% of sales in the fourth quarter, up 7 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from multiple PPI initiatives as well as favorable product mix and lower transportation costs. These benefits were somewhat offset by supply chain expansion costs. SG&A of 20.9% of sales delevered 5 basis points versus prior year adjusted SG&A as the momentum we continue to build with our PPI initiatives across all functional areas of the company largely offset sales volume deleverage. \n Operating margin rate of 9.1% declined 48 basis points versus prior year adjusted operating margin. The effective tax rate was 23.8%, in line with prior year adjusted effective tax rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $16.9 billion, $1.6 billion lower than the prior year quarter as we invest in high-velocity Pro SKUs while managing replenishment in line with sales trends and improving the flow of spring product builds through our supply chain. As a reminder, prior year inventory excluded Canadian operations as the sale was complete before year-end. \n Now turning to capital allocation. In 2023, we generated $6.2 billion in free cash flow and returned $8.9 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. During the fourth quarter, we paid $632 million in dividends at $1.10 per share and repurchased 1.9 million shares for $404 million returning over $1 billion to our shareholders. Capital expenditures totaled $620 million in Q4 as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives to drive growth and profitability. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR finished the year at 2.81x. And lastly, we delivered a return on invested capital above 36% for the year. \n Now I would like to discuss our 2024 outlook. As Marvin mentioned, we are bullish on the medium- to long-term outlook for the home improvement industry, but the near-term macro backdrop remains uncertain. There is optimism around potential interest rate cuts and improved consumer sentiment. However, the timing of Fed actions remains unclear, and there can be a lag before monetary policy impacts the consumer. Also housing turnover remains depressed and the consumer is still showing a greater preference for spending on services rather than goods. \n We are expecting these factors to continue to pressure home improvement spending in 2024, especially for the DIY. And with that in mind, we are expecting sales ranging from $84 billion to $85 billion and comparable sales declines in a range of 2% to 3%. Pro sales should continue to outpace DIY as we leverage our multiyear strategy to improve product offerings, fulfillment options in the in-store and digital shopping experience to drive Pro growth at 2x the market rate. We expect operating margin in the range of 12.6% to 12.7%. \n When we bridge our 2023 operating margin to our 2024 expectations, there are a couple of points to keep in mind. First, the impact of sales volume deleverage and second, the cycling of a favorable legal settlement in each of the first 2 quarters. These pressures are partly offset by the expected positive impact of our ongoing enterprise-wide PPI initiatives. We have made significant progress in realizing our productivity goals over the past few years, and we remain laser-focused on driving these PPI efforts and closely managing expenses through this tough sales environment. These expectations result in full year earnings per share of approximately $12 to $12.30. \n Now to assist you with your modeling, I'd like to take a moment and provide some color on the cadence of our expected results for the year. As a reminder, the steep pullback in DIY demand, which intensified in the third quarter of 2023 sets us up for different compares in the first and second half of this year. Given this, we expect first half comp sales to remain under pressure as the current DIY demand trends continue. But as we move into the second half, we expect comp sales to improve as we begin to cycle over the pullback in the third quarter. \n To be clear, we are not forecasting an improvement in demand trends this year. Rather, the compares are easier in the second half. And while we are planning for a normal spring season, the timing of spring is unpredictable and always brings some variability to our first half performance. Given our customer mix, these DIY drivers disproportionately impact our business. Now more specific to our first quarter, we expect comp sales to be consistent with our fourth quarter results approximately 300 basis points below the bottom of our full year guide. The combination of lower sales volumes as well as cycling a sizable legal settlement is expected to result in a Q1 operating margin rate approximately 200 basis points below the prior year adjusted rate. \n Before I close, let me remind you of our capital allocation strategy, which remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business with capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. Next, we continue to target a 35% dividend payout ratio. We also plan to use our free cash flow to repay a $450 million bond maturity and then return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. \n In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute through the near-term market uncertainty and remain focused on realizing the benefits of our total home strategy while continuing to drive sustainable shareholder value. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Peter, sure, this is Brandon. In terms of incremental, decremental, we've established essentially a flow-through rule of thumb. If our sales do exceed the top end of our guide, we do expect about 10 basis points for every 1% of incremental comp sales on the high side. And then on the low side, sales fall below the bottom end. We're looking at about 15 basis points of margin contraction for every point of comp decline. So high level, that's more of a rule of thumb on an annual basis. It doesn't necessarily work in terms of quarterly performance. \n And the other thing I'll stress is the plus 10 and minus 15, not necessarily natural output. So I would tell you that the model and the algorithm very contingent on us continuing to drive PPI across all functions, and that's what's contemplated on both the upside and the downside. Yes. Peter, I think to your first question on just our ability to manage costs. We're really pleased with our ability to manage expenses here in the last couple of years through this downturn. We have a robust and evolving road map of PPI initiatives. We were down comps 4.7% this year, expecting down at the midpoint, 2.5%. So our ability to manage the sales deleverage there with that robust pipeline. Again, really pleased there. And as we look out, a number of initiatives you heard from Joe and Bill that we continue to be excited about. We believe in '24 in particular, that PPI is going to enable us to offset over $400 million of wage pressure, inflationary pressure and strategic investments. \n I think the second part of your question, just as we think about ticket into 2024, we are expecting that to hold up, and that's largely what we saw in 2023. The pullback is expected again in transactions. And really, the drivers of that Pro growth positively impacting average ticket more from a mix standpoint.\n And then on the pressure point side, we're continuing to see the DIY bigger ticket pressure, and that's going to continue to be a drag. We don't expect any significant improvement off of that second half 2023 run rate. And then on appliances, specifically, ASP pressure is expected to continue as we return to more of a pre-pandemic environment. But overall, as we cycle into the second half of the year, we are expecting a more normal historical relationship between average ticket and transactions. Zack, this is Brandon. I would say on SG&A, it's really 2 themes and it's the cycling of the settlements and its deleverage on lower sales. And when you look at the midpoint of the range, a step back about 65 basis points, it breaks down about half and half there. So those are really as we look at managing SG&A in '24. Those are the pressure points.\n You mentioned incentive compensation. We paid a discretionary bonus in Q4 of $140 million, which offset any previously expected Q4 benefit that we had from lower management incentive comp, and we're pleased that we were able to reward our frontline associates. But what that resulted in for the full year '23, we had the benefit from lower management incentive comp based on performance. That was offset by the discretionary frontline bonuses that we paid in Q2 and Q4. So that really does not create a headwind for us as we bridge '23 to '24. So back to the 2 themes, it's mainly the cycling of the legal settlements and the deleverage on lower sales. Yes, Zack. Sorry, I forgot your gross margin question. So I'll take that one. I'll toss it to Marvin for Pro. So we're expecting gross margins for '24 to be roughly flat. And the gross margin themes are really similar to what we saw here in 2023. Ongoing supply chain investment pressure as we wrap the rollout of market delivery. We're continuing to make investments in Pro fulfillment, but those pressures are being offset by ongoing PPI initiatives that Bill discussed as we manage product costs, lower transportation, continue to expect private brands. So those are the puts and takes from a gross margin standpoint. And on Pro, I'll toss it to you, Marvin. Yes, I would just say, Simeon, you mentioned the base case. I mean our base case guide assumes no change in macro conditions versus what we've experienced here the last couple of quarters. It's unclear is the timing of the rate cuts, the improvements in home improvement share of wallet. Marvin mentioned housing turnover, consumer sentiment. So sort of more of the same philosophy there. And even when we start to see some green shoots there, it's going to be -- the trends are going to improve. There is an expected lag before the macro drivers we believe are going to translate into spending. So those have been the underpinnings, the assumptions that we've made here for 2024. And again, the improvement is just a function of what we're cycling in the second half versus our views on the macro and the timing of any improvement. Chris, let me -- I'll hit the weather things first, and it really was just a January winter -- extreme winter weather story impacted January as we sized at about 200 basis points of impact on the month. It had an outsized impact on our Pro business over those weeks. The other weather theme also just to mention is we've cycled 2 straight years of hurricane recovery with Ian and Ida, it's about 150 basis point comp impact to Q4, just cycling that. But again, that was all baked into our expectations. And in terms of just what we saw through the holiday season, I'll actually toss it over to Bill, and he can give a view on what we saw in terms of consumer behavior there. Yes, Steve. Really, just when we look at the cadence of comps, I'm going to reaffirm my earlier comment, we expect the macro pressures, inflation, higher interest rates, low housing turnover to persist. When we looked specifically at the second half, we're cycling the easier compares as we comp over the DIY weakness that intensified in particular in Q3 of last year. And to be clear, our comp improvement in the second half is not a result of any views on the improving macro, but purely are reflective of easier year-over-year comparison. So we looked at the cadence. We looked at it a lot of different ways. I would tell you on a 2-year basis, which we leaned into pretty hard 2-year ex lumber, there's a pretty consistent trajectory as we moved across the year. So we feel really comfortable with the full year, the breakdown, the comps and the operating margin and wanted to provide the right level of transparency and visibility to that."

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, comparable sales declined 6.2% as DIY customers continue to remain cautious with their home improvement spend and harsh weather impacted large parts of the U.S. in January. In spite of these challenges, I'm very pleased with the excellent customer service in our stores and strong operating profit performance for the quarter, driven by a disciplined focus on our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. \n Looking at the full fiscal year 2023, we delivered sales of $86.4 billion, adjusted operating margin of 13.3% and adjusted earnings per share of $13.09. \n Beginning with our DIY sales results. November and December trends improved from the third quarter, followed by a sharp drop in traffic during periods of extreme weather in January. Macroeconomic factors like persistent inflation and a stagnant housing market continue to make DIY customers and consumers hesitant to spend on big ticket purchases for their homes. And those who did engage in home improvement activities took on smaller, nondiscretionary projects with a heightened focus on value. This impacted demand for bigger ticket interior categories like kitchen and bath, flooring and appliances. \n In last quarter, we shifted our strategy to adapt to these changing consumer behaviors resulting in a record Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales and improved holiday sell-through and margins. While we're pleased to see these results, we're now focused on winning spring and we're excited to see how the customer responds to our more targeted traffic-driving marketing strategy and our lineup of great spring products at an outstanding value. Bill will provide more detail on our compelling product assortment for spring later in the call. \n Amongst the most exciting changes for this spring is our new DIY loyalty program that we announced in January. This first-of-its-kind rewards program designed for DIY customers gives these value-focused homeowners more reasons to choose Lowe's. In a marketplace where nearly all DIY home improvement customers shop multiple retailers, MyLowe's Rewards loyalty program is designed to get these DIY customers to choose Lowe's over other retail competitors for the home improvement needs. We expect this to drive traffic and return visits while also enabling us to personalize offers and experiences for our loyalty members, creating a flywheel effect that increases DIY loyalty and demand over time, both in-store and online. MyLowe's Rewards will be available nationwide in March just in time for spring making Lowe's the only national home improvement retailer with a distinct loyalty offering for both Pro and DIY customers. \n Now moving to Pro. Despite a challenging macro environment and difficult weather in January, our comparable Pro sales were flat for the quarter. As a reminder, our core Pro customer is a small- to medium-sized business owner. And in our recent Pro survey, these customers told us their backlogs are in line with last year, and they are cautiously optimistic about their ability to generate and close leads in 2024. We remain focused on executing our holistic Pro strategy with more convenient fulfillment options and enhanced product assortment, creating a best-in-class digital experience and a rewards program that incentivizes long-term loyalty. As these investments scale and mature, they will increasingly save Pros time and money, enabling us to earn more of their business as we aim to grow Pro at 2x the market rate. \n Now turning to online. Comparable sales were flat for the quarter, and we're pleased to see higher conversion rates and lower returns, a positive indicator that customers are responding to our faster fulfillment and improved digital experience. Our talented technology team remains focused on developing a best-in-class omnichannel experience to seamlessly serve our multigenerational customer base, including co-creating innovative customer solutions with world-class technology companies like our immersive kitchen design app for Apple's new Vision Pro headset and using generative AI to improve how we sell, shop and work like our home improvement ChatGPT plug-in. \n Now let's transition to our view to macro. As we look forward, many of you are asking when we expect home improvement demand to inflect? Although it's a very fair question, unfortunately, it's still very difficult to predict. And while there is increased confidence of a soft landing, there's still a lot of speculation on the timing of anticipated interest rate cuts in the pace of slowing inflation. It's also unclear how quickly the consumer will react to these changes and how quickly their spending habits will change. Overall, the consumer is financially healthy. But in this post-pandemic time frame, customers are still showing a preference of spending on services with elevated demand for travel, restaurants and other experiences. And while we anticipate these trends will normalize, the timing is uncertain. \n Also, existing home sales are at levels we've not seen in almost 30 years. And even as mortgage rates decline, 2/3 of homeowners remain locked in at rates below 4%, which may keep many on the sidelines. Due to these factors, we expect DIY demand to remain under pressure, and Brandon will provide more detail on our 2024 expectations later in the call. However, we're very confident in our strategic plan and in our ability to execute at a high level in a multitude of economic environments. \n Despite near-term uncertainty, let me remind you why we remain bullish on the medium- and long-term outlook for home improvement. The 3 core demand drivers of our business, disposable personal income, home price appreciation and the age of housing stock remain supportive. When you pair these factors with trends like chronic undersupply of homes, millennial household formation, baby boomers aging in place and a sustained number of people working from home, you can see why we are confident that home improvement demand will trend upwards over time across both homeowners and Pros. \n And in the meantime, we're focused on controlling what we control, and making the right investments in our Total Home Strategy to modernize our supply chain and IT infrastructure, localize and improve our merchandising assortments, rolling out a Pro and DIY loyalty program, continuing to elevate our store environment and developing a best-in-class digital and omnichannel experience. All of these investments in our Total Home Strategy will position Lowe's to win in the short run and set us up for strong sales and profit growth when the home improvement market recovers. \n Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our hard-working associates for their commitment to serving customers. In recognition of their dedication, we awarded our frontline associates with an end-of-year discretionary bonus of $140 million. This is our way of saying thank you to hourly associates and assistant managers who serve our customers and make our communities better. As I travel across the country visiting stores and conducting town halls to hear directly from our frontline associates, I'm consistently humbled by their passion, commitment and their expertise. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Bill. Yes. So on the mix, that's directionally correct on the percentages. And look, we feel good about the resilience of our Pro customer. And as a reminder, our customers are small to medium sized business owner, and we're actually pleased with the survey results where they feel confident that they can build, the backlog is consistent with what they saw last year and that they can continue to drive their business. \n And again, they're cautiously optimistic based on what they know, but that gives us confidence that the things we're doing around loyalty, around product assortment expansion, around service levels, our digital platform and how we've dramatically improved that. And we think we have a best-in-class experience is resonating. And relative to the DIY, I mean we equally feel good about the level of execution in that business. I mean we view it as probably as a macro issue versus a strategic issue or any type of an execution issue. \n As Brandon I both said in our prepared comments, when we think about the medium to long term, we're very bullish because we've made tremendous investments in this business across supply chain, IT infrastructure, omnichannel, localization, assortment planning, space productivity, store environment and service levels that we know are going to pay dividends, not only in the short run while we deal with this macroeconomic headwind, but when the market recovers, we think we're perfectly positioned to grow and take market share. No, look, it's a fair question. I think the best way for me to answer would be our customer service results. And when you look at the fact that we have improvements in both Pro and DIY, 200 basis points for both. That gives you an indication that our service levels remain extremely high and also gives you an understanding of the power of our PPI initiatives because a lot of our expense takeout is not the traditional cut payroll, it is more about the investments of technology that drives productivity that allows us to add more hours to driving service and selling and taking hours out of tasking. \n And Joe has talked about this for 5 years. We're trying to build a model where we invest technology and we drive productivity that allows us to have more customer-facing associates and less tasking. So we believe that our activity-based staffing model puts us in a great position that when sales go up, we invest a payroll based on the activity driven to create the sales. And when sales come down, we have an activity-based system that we think is best-in-class that we can take hours out based on department level day and hour that we think will drive the business from a productivity standpoint, but without hindering service. So we feel good about the whole model, and we don't think there's any negative implications of sales going up and SG&A not being able to be managed as tightly and as efficiently as we've managed in the last couple of years. One last point. I mean that's just one example of many initiatives that Brandon and I both have on our time line that we've yet to develop and yet to implement. So this is an ongoing process that is alive and well in every function, including merchandising, as Bill outlined in his prepared comments. I'll give you my perspective, Simeon, and I'll let Brandon provide any additional comments. When you think about the cadence of our comp sales for this year, as Brandon mentioned, is more indicative of year-over-year comparison versus our forecast that the market is going to improve at some point this year. We hope that it improves and we are positioning ourselves that when that happens, we think that we will have outsized top and bottom line growth. But our perspective of 2024 is that we're going to feel this DIY pressure throughout the year and we're going to perform at a high level irrespective of kind of what type of macro environment that we're dealing with. I'll let Brandon add any additional comments. And Chris, this is Marvin. Just one last point on appliances. The work of our market delivery supply chain infrastructure is going to be significant, not only in 2024, but for years to come. I mean, we're virtually the only national player that can deliver major appliances next day and two-day in virtually every zip code in the country. And that's significant in addition to having same-day capacity for customers to have emergency purchases we still have take-with inventory in virtually every store where a customer can come in and literally leave with an appliance within the hour. And so our model is difficult, if not impossible, to replicate in the brands that Bill and his team have brought to our assortment is something that we think will continue to work for us. And look, we'll work and manage through the macro environment. And I think Bill and his team have done a really nice job, and we'll continue to listen to the consumer and pivot based on where they want us to go. Yes. Kate, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part, and I'll let Bill or Joe jump in on the second part. But if you think about the DIY consumer for a second, the consumer is healthy and we feel good about the financial wherewithal of that consumer. They're simply choosing to leverage their spend in different places. As we've discussed and is not just us, but in all the different companies that talk about consumer spending, customers are just spending more of their wallet on experiences, on travel, on concerts, on restaurants because of this whole post-COVID relationship of getting back out and getting back to normal. \n And also, I don't think is a surprise for us to say that customers purchased quite a few home-related goods during the pandemic. So we're still working through that cycle. Having said that, we believe that we will work our way out of this macro environment at some point. We're not trying to call the timing on it. Our objective is to continue to invest in our business and execute at a high level. So whenever that consumer spend reverts back to normal, we're going to be in a perfect position to take advantage of it.\n One of the reasons why we launched our DIY loyalty program is specifically for the DIY consumer to give them some level of rationale to choose us over someone else and to create a level of differentiation in the marketplace, both in-store and online, so that we can be a preference for the DIY consumer. And so as we think about what they're buying and where we think that big ticket is going, I think it remains to be seen, but we feel good about what we're positioning for those consumers, and we'll wait on whatever time frame occurs with them to change their spending habits. This is Marvin. I'll take that final part of your question. So on the new store openings, it's -- we're going to always look for what we describe as real estate voids around different parts of the country where we believe that we can get the right return on our capital for new store investment. But candidly, I mean, our focus is on space productivity. We have such incredible upside opportunities in our stores to just invest capital in our existing infrastructure and create space productivity. We think the return on invested capital is significantly greater in using our dollars for that versus opening new stores with expensive real estate, where we're struggling to get those investments to pencil. And again, we'll open a handful of stores for voids where you're going to see us spend a ton of time on driving space productivity and creating greater value from the assets that we already own. And that's going to be our key focus. \n Relative to rural, we're extremely pleased with the performance of those 300-plus stores when you think about categories like pet, things like clothing and automotive, they're positive performing, outperformed the company and most other merchandising categories. And you're going to see us start to expand some of those rural categories in nonrural locations around the country. We wanted to make sure that we learned enough about the consumer demand, enough about how we serve customers well and Bill and Joe and their teams have done an exceptional job. And so you're going to hear us continue to talk about this, but it's something that we're very pleased with. And you'll start to see it show up in more places around the portfolio of our stores."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. While softer DIY demand trends continued this quarter, we remain focused on highlighting value and convenience, both in our stores and online to a price-conscious consumer, all while maintaining a balanced focus on profitability. We are also staying committed to serving a resilient Pro, which resulted in flat Pro comps as we continue to enhance our Pro product and service offering. \n Beginning with building products. This was our best performing area with positive comps in Building Materials. This strength was fueled by an increased demand for roofing and drywall, combined with improved fulfillment capabilities and in-stock positions to better serve our Pro customers. Throughout the quarter, we continued to launch additional Klein products across our stores, bringing the #1 tool brand for electrical and HVAC professionals back to Lowe's. We now have the largest assortment of Klein tools in the home improvement retail channel with initial sales exceeding our expectations across electrical, hand tools and stackable tool storage. Throughout the store, we continue to introduce new and innovative products to Lowe's, like Pella's hidden screen windows. This new window includes a built-in screen that appears when the window is open, but hides away when it's closed. \n Turning to home decor. This division was significantly impacted by softer DIY demand in bigger ticket interior categories like kitchens and bath, flooring and appliances. This past quarter, we pivoted our go-to-market strategy to be more responsive to a shift in shopping trends, like the appliance consumers' increasing preference for a single unit purchase and their search for the best deal. While these actions pressured our average selling price as expected, this approach was a major contributor to our successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday events. \n And while some consumers remain budget conscious, we are seeing others trade up for innovation, which we continue to offer across all major appliance categories. A great example is our exclusive LG smart refrigerator, which has a double freezer and also makes the popular slow melting craft ice. This product is consistently a top seller despite retailing for over $2,500. This type of innovation adds to our already industry-leading assortment in appliances, including high-quality brands like Bosch, Miele, LG, Samsung and KitchenAid, and we are continuing to help our customers see the value and attainability of trading up for affordable premium features. \n Paint is another category where we've seen product innovation resonate like our exclusive line of Spec Right paint designed for Pros who paint. Beyond gaining traction with Pros, we saw strong exterior paint demand before the weather turned colder in January, which gives us confidence we have the right offering in place as spring arrives. We also recently completed the rollout of our upgraded paint department, which converted our color wall to trusted Sherwood-William Colors and improve the shopping experience to make it easier for our customers to grab the higher-margin attachment items they need to complete their paint projects. \n Turning to our results and hardlines. This is another area where we quickly adjusted to the changing consumer buying patterns, which was reflected in our improved holiday sell-through and profitability. We are also encouraged that our new rural assortments continue to resonate across the country with strength in apparel, pet and automotive as consumers respond to the products and brands. We also recently launched a new partnership with Sunrun, the market leader in home solar and battery installation. This partnership now enhances our services offering for consumers looking to power their homes with renewable energy. \n Lowe's is the go-to destination for homeowners in spring. And as we enter our biggest season of the year, we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on this demand. As Marvin mentioned, we are excited about our product lineup. The launch of Toro builds on our industry-leading outdoor power equipment lineup alongside John Deere, Aaron's, EGO, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Kobalt and SKIL, our outdoor power equipment assortment is unmatched in home improvement, which is reflected in our continued market leadership in this space. I'm also excited about our new patio sets from our private brands, allen + roth and Origin 21, which enables homeowners to update their outdoor spaces for spring with trending styles across multiple price points. \n And if consumers don't see the color they're looking for on our sales floor, they can easily shop the extended aisle with associates now able to tender the purchase directly on their mobile smart devices. The merchants in our seasonal businesses are also bringing customers innovation and functionality at more competitive prices like our new exclusive Char-Broil grill lineup, which lets grillers switch from a traditional grill to a griddle in seconds or the fast-growing Blackstone brand of grills that continues to bring new features and value to the market. \n Beyond our compelling seasonal assortment and strong in-stock position, I'm also looking forward to launching our enhanced marketing strategy for spring. This season, we are taking a more sophisticated tech-enabled advertising approach and we will be featuring traffic-driving events that will motivate homeowners to get started on their spring projects at Lowe's. \n We are also leaning into live sports with an expanded NFL relationship and leveraging our popular commercials featuring Lowe's home team players trying their hands at DIY projects. We are extremely pleased with the success of this season's home team players with 2 members of the Lowe's team, Travis Kelce and Christian McCaffrey, both participating in Super Bowl 58 while being featured in our commercials. \n Shifting gears to merchandising productivity. Our team is making tremendous progress on our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives, which, as we planned, are offsetting the cost of our supply chain and Pro investments. As a reminder, the PPI initiatives that I outlined at our analyst and investor conference include expanding our private brand penetration, improving inventory productivity, maintaining a disciplined approach to pricing and promotions, scaling our retail media network and closely managing product costs. \n Over the past year, we have been working closely with our vendor partners to claw back some of the cost increases we absorbed during periods of exceptionally high inflation. And now that raw material and transportation costs are normalizing. Our best-in-class cost optimization tool gives us robust data down to the item level that allows us to take a calculated surgical approach, helping guide us to reducing costs across our portfolio. As we work to recoup these costs with our suppliers, we are reinvesting those savings into our marketing and merchandising strategies to drive traffic and sales. \n As I close, I'd like to thank our vendors and merchants for their unwavering focus on delivering value to our shared customers and for putting us in a strong position to win spring. \n I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Yes. Chris, I think for the holiday, we saw -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw record holiday sales. We saw the consumer respond very favorably to our trim and tree program and saw a nice performance there. We also saw, as you mentioned, December was warmer. And so we saw those outdoor businesses perform both on the Pro side as well as on the DIY side as the consumer continued to take on outdoor projects. As we've rolled into February and get started with 2024, as we begin to start our spring program for the South and Deep South, we're starting to see some of those early signs of spring where the weather is warmer, we're starting to get started with some of those spring-related businesses. So where we've got some warm weather, we're starting to see some of those early signs of spring. So we're excited about that. Yes. So for the year, we saw share growth in appliances. For the quarter, we saw unit growth across all the major categories. We did see average selling price pressure as we called out. For the key major events, both Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw a nice performance across those holiday weeks, and we're pleased with that. We did see the consumer pivot. And we met them where they wanted to go, and that was a shift from multiunit purchases to a single unit purchase as the consumer was looking for that. \n We also see the consumer moving to kind of two spectrums. We're seeing them look for value, so looking for products in that value conscious, and we're also seeing them trade up and finding innovation, and I'll share two examples. They'll look for entry-level laundry, for example, and then they're not afraid to invest in, for example, the GE Profile all-in-one washer dryer combination that retails for over $2,500 of which we could sell every single one that we can get our hands on. So those are just 2 spectrums of what's going on in that business. And it's happening across really all categories of the appliance business. So it's really 2 spectrums of what's going on.\n We're continuing to see our online appliance business perform very well as that business continues to evolve, and we're continuing to build out our capabilities there to make sure that we're meeting the customer where they want to be met and those fulfillment capabilities and delivery. And as Joe talked about, with two-way text and market delivery and getting all those capabilities rolled out so that we can fulfill the way we want to fulfill. Yes. Kate, I would just add that it really varies by product category. And so as I said, with appliances, you've got really two spectrums going. You've got the value-conscious consumer looking at low-end pricing all the way to innovation, and we meet the customer across a variety of price points. And then you have the Pro looking at their jobs, and we can meet them wherever they want to be met, whether that's on stock cabinets and having those products in our stores again across a multitude of price points that we offer in our stores and the different levels of product quality of product that we offer both online and in-store.\n And as we get ready for spring, we have a lot of new product that we're excited about. And so you think about bigger ticket product like riding lawn mowers, walk-behind mowers, the launch of Toro, it's bigger ticket product. We're excited about that. And those are all new. And so same thing with patio furnitures, we introduced Origin 21. We introduced the allen + roth program. Those are bigger ticket products as she's looking to address and upgrade their outdoor spaces. So again, we want to meet her wherever she wants to be met. We want to be able to offer a variety of pricing to her based on how she wants to be met as she takes on these projects. And that's what we're trying to do, both online and in-store. \n And we're excited about the readiness. We've worked really hard with our assortments that we offer both online and in-store. We've worked really hard to make sure that we've got these variations across the country so that we're localized to address those needs across the different areas and geographies of our stores, and we're ready. We're ready for mother nature to cooperate and we're ready to get going. So with that, Rob, we have time for one more question."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking our frontline team for their relentless focus and execution this quarter. Their efforts to serve our customers while tightly managing controllable expenses once again resulted in improved customer service scores and strong operating profit performance despite slower sales. Customer satisfaction scores were up 200 basis points this quarter versus last year with improvements in both Pro and DIY, reflecting the hard work of our frontline associates combined with improved omnichannel fulfillment capabilities. In fact, this year, omni score has improved almost 25% since 2020. Customers have new functionality like two-way texting, where they can be notified in advance to confirm their delivery date as well as same-day delivery options through our gig network. They can also use our new self-service functionality to track their order status and resolve issues directly, all without needing to call a store. \n In addition to expanding our fulfillment options and improving how we communicate with our customers, we're also enhancing the BOPIS or buy online, pickup in store experience through our new front-end configuration. We completed over 450 front-end rollouts this year with over 500 planned for 2024. Customers are embracing the new front-end experience, telling us they appreciate the faster and easier checkout process. This new front-end configuration also keeps sales associates in the aisles helping customers instead of needing to assist with checkout process when lines get long. \n While we are improving the front end of our stores, we are also making strides on the back end with our ongoing freight flow transformation. We are further improving our freight flow process with distribution centers now adding new labels that are linked to each store's layout. These labels provide our store teams a direction of exactly where to place the product on the sales floor once the freight is removed from receiving. These enhancements will make it quicker and easier for associates to get products onto the floor and cross merchandise attachments and will drive better in-stocks for our customers and improve payroll productivity for our stores. These new capabilities and improved processes are all part of our ongoing perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives, which both improve the customer experience and drive profitability. \n Turning to our efforts to become the employer of choice in retail. I am really pleased with the progress we've made. Last quarter, we saw a record response rate to our annual associate engagement survey with 90%-plus participation. And even more importantly, scores improved significantly across 3 areas that we measure; engagement, leadership effectiveness and inclusion. It's clear that better associate engagement leads to lower turnover and directly translates into better business results with a workforce more focused on serving our customers and driving productivity in our operations. \n As Marvin mentioned, we announced $140 million in discretionary bonuses this quarter. This includes an incremental $5,000 for our assistant store managers and other frontline supervisors as well as our special discretionary bonus of $400 for full-time hourly associates and $200 for part-time hourly associates. Additionally, since 2018, we have invested over $3.5 billion in incremental wage and share-based compensation for our frontline associates. In fact, we are one of the few retailers to award stock grants to our store managers and assistant store managers so they share in our long-term success. These programs for our store leaders are not new. In fact, store managers have been receiving share-based compensation for decades and assistant store managers since 2019. We are also creating opportunities for advancement for our associates to encourage them to build their careers with Lowe's. \n Since 2018, we have added over 10,000 new department supervisors and over 2,500 new assistant store managers. And through Lowe's University, we are training and developing our associates for their next role. This year, we're extending our advanced leadership training to our assistant store managers to equip them with the tools they need to succeed as they move up in their career. With these enhancements, we've worked to increase the number of store managers promoted from ASM to over 80% over the past 3 years. In fact, more than 80% of our leadership roles are now built from within. \n All of these investments have led to one of the best spring staffing levels in many years, and the stores are ready to serve our customers this spring. We are very excited about the new MyLowe's Rewards DIY loyalty program and the great spring merchandise lineup Bill outlined. As I close, I would like to once again thank all of our store associates for their hard work and dedication. \n Now I'll turn it over to Brandon. And Simeon, let me give you a quick example. If you think about 5 years ago, we had less than 50% of the stores that actually had self-checkout. And so over the last 5 years, we've mentioned we've developed our own internal self-checkout built with the home improvement customer in mind. We now have that complete across the entire chain. And now we have started our front-end transformation in adding incremental assisted self-checkouts, and we have 400 stores complete. This has also allowed us to roll out a best-in-class loyalty program for the DIY customer that is tied right in with our mobile technology. And so as we look to complete the incremental 500 in 2024. And then I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our back-end initiatives, too. So very confident in the activity-based labor model and the PPI initiatives we continue to focus on."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2023. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter comparable sales decline at 7.4%. Our results were driven by a greater-than-expected pullback and DIY discretionary spending, especially in bigger ticket categories. While we've seen a more cautious consumer for some time now, this quarter, we saw some of these consumers increasingly prioritizing experiences over goods spending on travel and entertainment.\n As a reminder, at Lowe's, 75% of our revenue is driven by DIY customers and 25% by Pros, while the broader market mix is roughly 50% DIY and 50% Pro. As a result, whenever the DIY customer becomes cautious, it disproportionately affects us. And while we face a softer DIY demand in the third quarter, I'm pleased that at the same time, we once again delivered positive sales comp in Pro.\n Now I'd like to take a moment to dig a bit deeper into our DIY performance for the third quarter. In categories like appliances, decor, flooring and kitchen and bath, where we have strong DIY penetration, we saw increased pressure on sales of bigger ticket purchases like appliances where consumers are postponing purchases if they can. For example, customers may have previously bought an entire kitchen suite may now just buy a refrigerator. Keep in mind that the industry-wide pullback in appliance sales has a larger impact on Lowe's since we are the market leader in appliances in the U.S. with 14% of our sales coming from this category. Later in the call, Bill will discuss some of the initiatives we're implementing in Q4 to improve DIY performance with a more targeted effort to reach value-conscious customers including our most competitive offers on single unit appliance purchases ahead of the holiday season and the launch of our Lowe's lowest price guarantee, so our customers can shop with confidence knowing that they'll always find the best price at Lowe's.\n Despite the pullback in DIY, our Pros are still working and many of their projects are a result of increased wear and tear on aging homes, which lead to unavoidable repairs. This continues to create project backlogs for small- to medium-sized Pro, who is our core customer. In our most recent survey, nearly 70% of PROs reported healthy project backlogs, but given the uncertain macro environment, they're feeling a little less confident. Although Pros may be a bit cautious in this environment, our ability to deliver a positive pro sales comp in the third quarter is a reflection that our strategy is working.\n We're making progress with the investments we've made over the last several years to improve our service offering, including increasing loyalty through our MVP Pro rewards, developing a world-class CRM platform, improving job site delivery, enhancing service levels in our stores, creating a more seamless online experience and a number of merchandising initiatives that Bill will discuss later in the call. Overall, we built a competitive pro sales and service model, which is creating a flywheel effect that will enable us to grow Pro sales at 2x the pace of the market.\n Let's now turn to online sales, which declined 4% in the quarter as the same pressures in DIY bigger ticket categories impacted digital sales.\n Now let's talk about what we're doing to manage this unique environment. In store operations, we've made foundational improvements to associate productivity that enable us to effectively align labor to demand while continuing to serve our customers. During the quarter, we leveraged these new capabilities to reduce operating expenses while enhancing the customer experience for both Pro and DIY customers at the same time. Joe will provide more detail on these initiatives and our improved customer service scores later in the call. I'm pleased that our disciplined focus on expense management across the organization contributed to a 46 basis point increase in operating margin rate compared to adjusted operating margin in the prior year despite the sales decline, which led to diluted earnings per share of $3.06.\n As we pull ways to drive improved sales with our DIY customers, I'd like to provide you with an update on two initiatives, our new Lowe's outlet stores and our rural strategy. Let me start with our Lowe's Outlet stores. We opened our 15th Lowe's outlet location in Q3. With these smaller format stores, we can leverage lower cost real estate in trade areas closest to our core customer without cannibalizing a nearby Lowe's store. In an environment where DIY consumers are seeking value, we're pleased with the customer response and the overall performance of our outlet locations. These stores complement our market delivery network, allowing us to offer savings between 25% to 70% off on big and bulky scratch and dent items like appliances, patio furniture, grills, all while maximizing profitability and offering our customers enhanced value. We look forward to discussing the potential growth opportunities of this strategy on an upcoming call.\n Turning to our rule strategy. This one-stop shop concept is designed to give customers located in rural areas across the country, everything they need for their home and farm, including a wide offering of farm, ranch and outdoor products. During the summer, we launched this rural assortment to over 300 stores where we're selling products like livestock feed, pet food, utility vehicles and apparel from brands like Cohort and Wrangler. These programs include a Petco store within a store, which enhances the total home solution we offer by bringing together home improvement and pet care services, products and expertise under one roof.\n We're pleased to see this new initiative already gaining traction with strong performance in pet, apparel and automotive. In fact, these rural customers are our best-performing DIY segment and these stores are performing significantly above the company average. Given this initial success, we're now exploring expanding this rule assortment beyond the original 300 designated rule stores. In addition, we're planning to add incremental merchandising initiatives within these original 300 stores because the customer is responding favorably to these new assortments and product lines.\n Looking ahead, we remain focused on our merchandising and marketing efforts that highlight the everyday value at Lowe's for our price-sensitive customers. And we will continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives within our Total Home strategy as we strive to become a world-class omnichannel retailer.\n And as I wrap up, let me say that we remain bullish on the medium- to long-term outlook for the home improvement industry, supported by favorable housing and demographic trends. We expect home prices to be supported by a persistent supply/demand imbalance of housing, while at the same time, 250,000 millennial household formations are expected per year through 2025, and their parents and grandparents, the baby boomers increasingly prefer to age in place in their own homes. And we cannot overlook the fact that we now have the oldest housing stock in U.S. history with the medium age of homes now 41 years old, which will need ongoing investments in repair and remodel projects. These factors continue to reinforce our optimism about the mid- to long-term outlook for our industry.\n In closing, I'd like to thank our frontline associates with our continued hard work and dedication to serving customers and our communities.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.\n Despite a pullback in DIY discretionary demand, we are pleased that we delivered positive Pro comps this quarter as our enhanced product and brand offerings continue to resonate with the Pro. Over the past several years, we've added the brands that Pros want, and we have invested in the inventory quantities pros need, and we continue to tailor our product assortments to local building codes and preferences. These investments continue to pay off even in a more challenging macro environment, where we remain laser-focused on highlighting everyday value and convenience, both in our stores and online to a price-conscious consumer.\n Turning to our results in Building Products. We continue to serve our Resilient Pro customer who remains active, especially on repair and maintenance projects. We delivered positive comps in building materials, partly driven by strong performance in Pro-heavy categories like roofing and drywall. We also delivered comps above the company average in rough plumbing, largely driven by positive comps in water heaters demonstrating that Lowe's is the go-to solution for critical repair needs. This quarter, Klein Tools returned home to Lowe's. This trusted brand is the #1 tool brand for electrical and HVAC professionals, and we are thrilled to now offer the largest assortment of Klein Tools in the home improvement retail channel. Our Pro customers' response to our relaunch of Klein tools has exceeded our expectations, and we're excited about our plans to expand this iconic brand to support the unique needs of these trade professionals.\n Now let's shift gears to home decor, which was most heavily impacted by lower DIY project-related demand. And as you heard from Marvin, this had a greater impact in categories like appliances, flooring and kitchens and back. Within appliances, we are seeing lower industry unit volumes as well as the reintroduction of pre-pandemic levels of vendor-funded promotion, which puts pressure on average selling price. And while our results in kitchens and bath were also impacted by softer DIY demand. We are seeing our private brand products gaining traction as the consumer continues to look for value, like with our new allen + roth butcher block countertops. These are made of solid FSC-certified wood and this stylish product is a cost-effective way to refresh your kitchen, bar or studio. This item has been so popular that we are now doubling our sales expectations.\n Turning to paint. We delivered comps above company average in the quarter, largely driven by the Pro paint, who relies on Lowe's as a one-stop shop for their project needs. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our product offering, including a recent launch of an exclusive line of Sherwin-Williams primers from HGTV Home. These new primers designed for the Pro who paints, gives them a versatile multi-surface application that makes it easier to work on both interior and exterior projects.\n Shifting gears to hardlines. In addition to a broad-based DIY pullback, we also saw pressure in categories impacted by storm-related activity. such as generators, gas cans, fuel and chain saws as we cycled Hurricane Ian from last year. We delivered comps above company average in lawn and garden as our customers engaged in smaller fall cleanup projects. And we also drove comps above company average in hardware led by key Pro categories like fasteners, safety equipment and cleaning products.\n Lastly, we continue to build out our brand portfolio like with our new strategic partnership with the Toro Company. Their exciting product lineup further complements what is now the strongest brand offering in outdoor power equipment, one that resonates with both the Pro and DIY customer who relies on Lowe's to offer the best selection. We're looking forward to launching Toro ahead of our upcoming spring season and building on our momentum as the leading retailer of outdoor power equipment.\n In response to the customers' increased focus on value, I'd like to talk about how we are highlighting some of the ways that customers can save time and money during this holiday season. For starters, we recently kicked off our holiday campaign with a commitment to supporting shoppers in new ways, all season long, which includes a wave of exciting offers and new deals every week, on great gift ideas, including power tools from some of the best brands like DEWALT, Craftsman and Cobalt and pre-lit Christmas trees, trimmed with the innovative energy-saving LED lighting. Our customers can also look forward to same-day delivery on key holiday and home improvement items as well as services like holiday light hanging for the home through A&G.\n And as Marvin mentioned, we recently launched our new Lowe's Lowest Price Guarantee to remind customers that not only can they expect a great shopping experience, but they will also receive the lowest price on items for their home. In fact, Customers can now find our lowest prices of the year on select major appliances. And in an effort to simplify the offer and make it easier to understand, we're offering $100 off for every $800 a customer spends. For our Pros, we have tailored exclusive bulk saving offers on appliances as well and to drive even greater excitement and traffic on Black Friday, we will feature more than 10 major appliance doorbusters. We are excited to deliver what we think will be the most compelling offers in the market.\n In addition to these great deals, Lowe's is now offering Carhartt apparel online and in select stores. This iconic workwear brand makes a perfect gift for the Pro this holiday.\n Before I close, I'd like to highlight just a few of the perpetual productivity improvements or PPI work streams that are underway in merchandising. Our teams continue to make progress in our three main focus areas: product cost management, inventory productivity and pricing and promotional strategies.\n We continue to partner with our suppliers to take cost out, especially now that transportation and commodity costs have come down. And we are expanding our private brand portfolio, which delivers great quality and value at a lower price to our customers, while also driving better margin rate productivity. Our teams are working hard to ensure that customers have the best value every day at Lowe's, while also delivering productivity for the organization.\n And as I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation once again to our vendors and our merchants for their hard work, dedication and ongoing partnership.\n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their ongoing efforts to deliver excellent customer service. As Marvin mentioned, we were able to reduce operating expenses this quarter, while at the same time delivering a 200 basis point improvement in DIY customer satisfaction scores and a 300 basis point improvement for the Pro. This represents the ongoing benefit of our foundational technology investments, designed to modernize our stores operational process and simplify our associates' jobs while also creating a great shopping environment for our customers.\n Let me highlight just a few of these changes. For starters, we created an industry-leading customer-centric scheduling system, which allows us to predict customer demand and align staffing around peak customer traffic for each store and each department. This system creates enhanced operational agility so we can rapidly adjust as demand patterns shift. Second, we've enabled greater productivity by putting mobile smart devices in all of our associates' hands to make them more efficient, reducing manual tasking and enabling faster customer service. For example, by integrating smart devices with our new store inventory management system, or SIMS, our associates can find products 40% faster.\n And through Project Simple, we've eliminated duplicative tasks and reduced nonproductive hours, so we can re-purpose associate time from tasking to selling and service. A third foundational improvement is the expansion of our merchandising services team or MST. This team keeps our shelves stocked, and they recently assumed responsibilities for price changes across the store and watering in the garden center. MST is now leveraging a new app that directs them to serve a specific base based on the rate of sales, making their hard work even more productive and freeing up more time for our Red Best associates to spend with customers.\n Another important aspect of delivering excellent customer experience is convenience. That's why we're making a number of enhancements to create a more convenient shopping experience ahead of the holiday season.\n For example, we're extending our same-day delivery to in-store purchases through our gig network to both Pro and DIY customers. And in certain locations, we'll even be delivering live Christmas trees to our customers' doors saving them the hassle of getting it home themselves. This new gig delivery capability, which we first rolled out on lowes.com, enables us to tap into the One Rail network of 12 million drivers to deliver directly to Pro job sites and customer homes in just a matter of hours.\n Our store operations team is also focused on unlocking even more productivity through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. This past quarter, we fully retired the old self-checkout systems and have shifted to the proprietary self-checkout systems that we've built for the home improvement shopper. We've seen greater customer adoption of these new systems since they're so much easier to use. In fact, our front-end transformation is well underway, with approximately 450 stores planned by the end of this year. Over a 3-year time line, we're revamping the checkout experience across all of our stores and increasing the selling space at the front where we're adding more merchandise right of checkout with a new design that makes it easy to showcase grab-and-go items. And with this front-end transformation, we're shifting to an easy-to-use assisted self-checkout with cashiers who will be right there to answer questions and help customers when they need it.\n Finally, we're tripling the staging area for buy online, pick up in store orders to support increased online sales and create a much faster, easier customer experience building on our momentum when it comes to driving improved customer service scores for these orders. At the same time, we're excited to launch omni selling in our stores, a critical milestone in our journey to become a world-class omnichannel retailer, enabled by our new store operating system, we can now easily sell our endless aisle on Lowes.com within the aisles of our stores. For example, let's say, a customer is shopping for new faucets and browsing our selection of the most popular finishes in the store.\n While talking with an associate, they decide to go with the unique finish from Lowes.com that the associate highlights on their mobile device. The associate then saves the faucet in the customer's digital cart with their phone number and the customer can continue shopping in the store. When the customer is ready to check out, all the cashier needs to do to combine the digital and physical purchases is pull up the digital cart using the customer's phone number. We're still in the early innings here, but we know this is a great opportunity to drive our omni sales and make sure our customers get everything they need to complete their project in one shopping trip.\n As I close, I would like to thank all of our store leaders and associates once again for their hard work serving customers and delivering results each and every day. Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Brandon. \nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our Q3 results. We generated diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Please note, in the prior year, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $2.1 billion associated with our Canadian retail business. Now my comments from this point will reference comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures from last year were applicable. Q3 sales were $20.5 billion. For reference, prior year sales included $1.2 billion generated in our Canadian retail business.\n Additionally, Q3 results include a $115 million sales headwind due to the shift in our fiscal calendar as we cycle over a 53-week year. Comp sales were down 7.4% as a slowdown in DIY bigger ticket spending offset growth in Pro. Q3 comps were negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points due to lumber deflation. As a reminder, the calendar shift impacted total sales growth, but had no impact on comparable sales as comps are calculated based on weeks 28 through 40 in fiscal 2022. Comparable average ticket was down 0.5%, driven by lumber deflation, more normalized appliance promotions and a decline in big-ticket DIY transactions.\n However, average ticket still increased in the majority of our merchandise categories. Comp transactions declined 6.9%, driven by softer demand in DIY discretionary projects partly offset by positive comp transactions in Pro. Our monthly comps were down 6.3% in August, 8.3% in September and 7.3% in October as DIY traffic slowed as we exited our peak seasonal weeks. Gross margin was 33.7% of sales in the third quarter, up 36 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from our ongoing merchandising PPI initiatives as well as favorable product mix and lower transportation costs. This was partially offset by costs associated with the expansion of our supply chain network and consistent with our year-to-date performance, [ shrink ] was in line with prior year.\n SG&A of 18.4% levered 30 basis points versus prior year adjusted SG&A demonstrating our enterprise-wide agility to manage expenses and drive productivity in a lower sales environment. These results would not have been possible without the exceptional efforts of our store leadership teams to rapidly respond to the sales pressure as well as the ongoing benefits that we are harvesting from our technology-led PPI initiatives. Operating margin rate of 13.2% improved by 46 basis points versus prior year adjusted operating margin. The effective tax rate was 24.6%, in line with prior year adjusted effective tax rate.\n Inventory ended the quarter at $17.5 billion, down $2.3 billion compared to Q3 of last year. U.S. inventory dollars and units were both down compared to last year as we align inventory purchases with sales.\n Turning now to our capital allocation. During the quarter, we generated $485 million in free cash flow. We repurchased 7.3 million shares for $1.6 billion and paid $642 million in dividends at $1.10 per share, returning $2.2 billion to our shareholders. Capital expenditures totaled $579 million as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities within our Total Home strategy. Adjusted debt to EBITDA finished the quarter at 2.72x in line with our stated 2.75x leverage target.\n Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 35%, inclusive of an unfavorable 125 basis point impact related to transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business and the gain we reported in Q1.\n Now turning to our 2023 financial outlook. Given the recent pullback in DIY, bigger ticket discretionary spending and the uncertainty surrounding the macro factors that impact our business, we are updating our full year 2023 financial outlook. With this in mind, we are now forecasting Q4 comp sales to be fairly consistent with Q3 results. Also, the fourth quarter of 2022 included approximately $1.4 billion in sales from the additional 53rd week. We are now expecting 2023 sales of approximately $86 billion with a comparable sales decline of approximately 5%. We also now expect adjusted operating margin of approximately 13.3% and as our ongoing PPI initiatives and disciplined expense management helped to offset volume deleverage pressure from lower sales.\n Additionally, we expect full year interest expense of approximately $1.4 billion, capital expenditures of up to $2 billion and an adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 25%. This results in an updated outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $13.\n Please note that our outlook for operating margin and diluted earnings per share are adjusted to exclude the gain associated with the sale of our Canadian business that we recorded in Q1.\n Finally, we are reconfirming our capital allocation priorities. We will continue to invest in the business to take market share, target a 35% dividend payout ratio and then return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchase, which will be funded in the near term through free cash flow.\n And in closing, I'm confident that our continued investments in our Total Home strategy, our strong balance sheet and our ability to effectively manage our business in any environment will allow navigate the near-term challenges while continuing to deliver sustainable shareholder.\n And with that, we will open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: Marvin, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the 300 rural stores comping above average and some of those categories being the best performing ones. So curious, if you can maybe help reframe how you guys are thinking through the more medium-term and longer-term opportunity there. How many stores do you think can accommodate such an assortment? And any contextualization of the spread in the DIY comp in the 300 stores versus the company average? \nMarvin Ellison: Steven, thanks for the question. We're not going to get into that level of specificity for competitive reasons, but what I will tell you is that the rural stores have exceeded expectations. And as we noted, we started out with roughly 300. But candidly, the performance and the customer response has been such that we're now looking at a couple of different options. One option is we're going into those original 300, and we're add incremental investments initiatives, categories based on feedback from customers. We're also looking at categories that are working really well in those rural stores and asking the question, can we now take some of these categories and put them in nonrural format locations because we believe we could get the same response from customers in nonrural environments.\n And then thirdly, we're just looking at expanding our profile and definition of rule because some of these characteristics, we think can fit other locations. And because of the response and because of the DIY customer being such a critical component of our company strategy, we think this makes a really good strategic rationale and it's something that we're pursuing. But again, we'll speak more about this on future calls, but I don't want to get into more specifics for obvious competitive reasons. \nSteven Forbes: And then maybe sticking with some initiatives here and maybe a follow-up for Bill. The front-end transformation, we're probably far enough right into it where it'd be helpful if you maybe frame the ROI of such transformations. I don't know if you can sort of maybe go through what you're seeing in terms of comp lift and/or just what is the outlook right for next year as we think through the maturation benefit of such an agenda. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. So as Joe said, we've got roughly 450 stores that we'll complete by the end of the year. We continue to test and learn in these stores. As you can imagine, there's opportunities for us to try some additional merchandising opportunities up front of the store. It's all about getting another item in the basket, and there's opportunities in the obvious areas like snacks and drinks, but we're also looking at other categories as well that can complement what we're doing and also that shopper, both a Pro and a do-it-yourselfer that's making that transaction in our store that could pick that kind of stuff up and you think about like aspirin, band-aid, stuff like that, that could complement what they're doing and could be used on a job site or in a glove box of a car at your home. \nMarvin Ellison: And Steve, the other thing that I'll add is this also complements the ongoing omni expansion that Joe talked about. As we extend the capabilities of connecting digital and physical stores, we need more productive space, and we need to just optimize all the things that the associates are going to accommodate and fulfill those orders. And as Joe mentioned, part of this is to create more designated space in a more productive fashion for that process, but also it's creating a much better customer experience, and it's also driving a lot of productivity for Joe's taming the store. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: Just kind of curious as you talked a lot about the PPI initiatives and your ability to kind of be agile with expenses. If we think kind of longer term, think maybe out to next year, if there's another environment where comp store sales are maybe down in the mid-single-digit range. How do we think about your ability to manage margins in that environment? I know some of the benefit this year is cycling Canada, but just maybe some benchmarks to think about as we move to next year on how the P&L could act in different top line environments. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Peter, this is Brandon. Just in terms of as we're looking at 2024, we're in the later stages of our planning process at the moment across the organization. So we're going to hold off on providing any in-depth guidance until our Q4 call. But what I will tell you just in terms of top line macro home improvement, there's continued uncertainty on interest rates, when we're going to see relief when existing home sales are going to turn the corner and begin to improve. And obviously, the ongoing impact of inflation, higher rates on consumer wallet. So we're watching all that. I think to your specific question on margins, we're managing several puts and takes as we look at next year. We're cycling onetime legal settlements, normalization of incentive comp, wage growth, the pacing of our PPI initiative. So we're looking at all that. We're going to take all those factors under consideration as we develop our guide and hold off on providing that until we get to February. \nMarvin Ellison: Peter, this is Marvin. And the only thing I'll add is you heard in some of your prepared comments, was talking about an old operating system. And we talked a lot about this 30-year-old operating system. There's really been a significant impediment to some of the technology advancements, and we're going to be sunsetting that system at the end of this year, and it's going to just unlock a little bit of acceleration in some of the technology advancements that we have on the project list. We just candidly, we couldn't get to because of this system. And so the good news is we're going to continue to work to Brandon's point on all the elements of running an improved business from a merchandising to operations, supply chain, but also the technology project list over the next 3 to 5 years is robust, and it's going to allow us to continue to find ways to drive profitability, irrespective of the macro environment that we're in. We're hoping the macro environment gets better with the brand at this point. We're going to wait until our Q4 call to talk about '24 and give a much more educated perspective at that time. \nPeter Benedict: All right. Fair enough. Appreciate that perspective. I guess my follow-up would be just around maybe the cost environment that you're seeing out there, a lot of talk of -- obviously, disinflation and some outright deflation in certain areas. What are you seeing right now in terms of the cost you're receiving from your suppliers? And how do you kind of view that as we look out over the next few quarter. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Peter, this is Brandon. I would say just in terms of costs coming into the organization at this point, just from an inflation price action response to that. It's leveled off pretty dramatically here as we move through the year. We've had targets in terms of clawback for this year. We laid those expectations out back in December, I would say, very much pacing in line with those targets. We laid out about $500 million over the course of 3 years. We're leveraging cost management teams, working closely with the merchants, the tech-enabled tools that we've invested in. We have very detailed product cost breakdowns that are informing those negotiations with our suppliers. So we're continuing to be balanced. We're taking a portfolio approach. We're investing in price strategically where needed, but also looking through the lens of protecting our margins. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I want to try to take another stab at this margin question for next year. I know there's not a whole lot you can provide. If you think about the levers that you have do you lose any for next year? I realize you're going to lap the legal settlement in the first part of the year. And then connected to it, as you manage your selling expenses, do you think that's having an impact on sales at all? Meaning, is that not something you press on is hard for next year? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Simeon, this is Brandon. I wouldn't say when we look at next year, we're losing the benefit of any of those levers. In fact, I think we're looking at where we have opportunities to accelerate. We've talked about PPI, I talked about where we were in that journey in terms of middle innings. Marvin mentioned the conversion of the store technology to a modern omnichannel platform. We got a lot of initiatives stacked up where we expect to see those benefits as that gets delivered next year. Earlier question on transforming the front end really expanding assisted checkout, expanding the BOPIS experience, and then Bill talked in his prepared comments about multiple other kind of merchandising PPI initiatives, whether it's cost clawback, inventory productivity, pricing, promotional strategies, expansion of private brands. So we're really confident in that portfolio of initiatives. We feel like it's in our control. We're managing the road map and the pacing of that and have a lot of confidence as we look at the longer-term margins that we can deliver against our stated targets there. \nMarvin Ellison: So Simeon, this is Marvin. I'll add this perspective. The reason why we call this a perpetual productivity improvement initiatives because we're trying to stay away from onetime events. We think that good companies create an ongoing sustained process of improvement and productivity gains. And so we have a road map of initiatives. And it's important that it's not just about store operations. You heard Bill talk about the PPI initiative, specifically for merchandising. If Don Frieson was here, he could speak specifically to supply chain and Seemantini could speak specifically for IT.\n And so this is a culture that we've created here that candidly did not exist, but the key word is perpetual. And that means that it's ongoing, it's consistent and it's sustainable. And so as we look at '24, we know we're not going to get into the details. What Brandon is reinforcing is that we have a list of things that we're going to do. We're well aware of what we're overlapping. We understand some of the onetime factors we're going to face. And we built processes, initiatives in place to address that. And we'll be more transparent and more detail in our Q4 call because we think it's really important to lay out to you all exactly how we see it and the steps we're going to take. \nSimeon Gutman: So my gentle follow-up to that, Marvin, is you have OpEx productivity and PPI. Those are the two biggest unlocks. I -- Just to clarify or an assumption, it doesn't sound like what the business comps has anything to do on what those two buckets produce. And then is there a situation in which those two buckets actually produce more in terms of sequencing in '24 than what it was yielding in '23. \nMarvin Ellison: So I'll give you the perspective of a long-term operator. If we get the top line, PPI works a whole lot better. So irrespective we're going to intensify the focus. Obviously, if we have a softer top line perspective, we're going to be a lot more aggressive in the PPI side. But irrespective of our comp outlook, PPI is going to be in existence, and we're going to work really hard to make sure that we hit some of the key targets that we lay out. And again, you have our commitment that as we lay out 2024 as best we can, we'll be as transparent as possible about all of these things in our February call. \nOperator: Our next questions are from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: I want to focus a bit on the top line. You've seen increased big-ticket sensitivity, others are talking about, you mentioned flooring. People are doing smaller projects, you're not buying the suite of appliances, you're doing the bathroom, not the entire [first floor] and flooring. I guess -- so my question is, why isn't the Pro and the remodel business or maybe the remodel business and the answer is different from you on the Pro because of share, but why isn't the remodel business and the Pro business that the next should a drop? And given the changes that you've seen over the past 3 or 4 months, how are you thinking about the bottom of the comp cycle and sort of when does it start to refer back to positive? \nMarvin Ellison: So Chris, I'll take the first part of that, and I'm going to just let Bill Boltz talk about some of the initiatives relative to addressing some of the top line concerns. So specific on sales for us, when we look at the quarter, we look at it from a penetration from a DIY perspective and a product mix. So as a reminder, 14% of our revenue comes from appliances. So when you have pull back on some of these big-ticket categories like appliances, is going to be disproportionately impactful for us.\n Having said that, we look at the Pro and to your point, we had a positive comp, and we're really pleased with that, and I went through some of the investments we've made over the course of the last 4 years that we believe are paying dividends relative to that specific small or medium Pro. And the reason we think that, that specific segment of Pro will remain healthy, although cautious, as we've noted from our survey is because of the age of homes. I mean it is a foregone conclusion that if you have a house over 40 years old, things are going to break. And when those things break and those repairs are required that smaller-to-medium contractor is typically the one that's going to get that call.\n And these pros are incredibly transparent with us and 70% say they feel really good about their backlog. But they also said that when they watch the news and they read the headlines, they're a little cautious because they just don't know what's lurking around the corner, but they're busy because these homes are old. These homes are not turning, so people are living in these homes. And so that's really the driver of that customer segment remaining healthy and busy. And look, we can't predict the bottom. But what we can say is that we're incredibly disciplined. Anytime you can deliver a 46 basis point improvement in operating margin on a negative [ 7.4% ] comp.\n It tells you that there are a lot of really things working from a productivity standpoint that drives margin rate improvement and basis point improvement in customer service that we're really proud of. So we feel good about the execution of the team, and we can't predict kind of what's going to happen when, but we can say whenever it happens, we're well positioned to take advantage of it. And I'll pivot to Bill just to talk about kind of what we're trying to do to remain agile and to try to make sure that we are driving a business environment that's attracting DIY customers and keeping these products coming back also. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And Chris, just some of the things that we've talked about really over the last few quarters that I'm pleased with the work that the team has done is the continued acquiring of brands and making sure that we've got relevant assortments inside of our stores and online. And so we announced today Toro as part of our outdoor power equipment. We talked about Klein last quarter, and we're just starting to get that brand now into the electrical and the tool category. So that's excitement for us. We talked about localized assortments and Marvin touched briefly on the rural strategy. That's just one element of a localized opportunity.\n And then we continue to try to pivot to where the customer is. So as -- we've seen some of the softening in appliances from an industry-wide standpoint, because we're the industry leader here, we want to make sure that we can meet the customer where they want us to meet them, and that's adjusting. And so we feel like the adjustments the teams have made to make sure that we can go after the 100,000-plus appliances that break in the United States every single week that we're there when the consumer needs us both online and in-store. We continue to enhance our fundamentals and our foundation online. And so offering Apple Pay as a way to make it easier for the customer to transact online. This is just one element, same-day delivery and then obviously being seasonally relevant.\n As we go into this Friday with Black Friday, it's about making sure that we've got strong offers out there that gets the customer to the door into the website. And that's the stuff that we'll continue to do. And at the same time, we have to be competitively priced. We've got to be relevant every single day. And so that's the kind of work that the team continues to stay focused on. And it takes time, obviously, to get that customer to know that these changes have happened inside of our store and online, and we're just going to just stay focused on what we can control. \nChristopher Horvers: And then my follow-up is, again, on the Pro side. As you think about the momentum in that business over this year or what you're seeing in the basket in terms of the projects that they're doing. Whether it's size or price point -- price spectrum, is there any change in momentum on the Pro side of the business? \nJoseph McFarland: Chris, thanks for the question. And listen, we can tell you that with the firm loyalty and CRM that we launched, we continue to view the basket. We continue to view the mix. We are very encouraged and continue to exceed expectation in the core metrics. And we continue to launch new capabilities, things like online quotes for the bulk pricing that Bill talked about. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned the integrated same-day gig delivery, streamlined order tracking. And so there's a lot going into that pro from an effort standpoint. And so we continue to be pleased at the progress. \nOperator: Next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. \nSeth Sigman: So I wanted to follow up on pricing and promotional activity. Obviously, you talked about elevated promotions and appliances, and how that's being funded by vendors. I realize that category is a little bit unique, but how would you categorize discounting activity across other categories? And maybe you could also just elaborate on what you have seen and what you've been doing with that low price guarantee? \nWilliam Boltz: Yes, Seth, it's Bill. And so just a couple of things here. As I said, we are seeing probably more of a move on pre-pandemic levels of promotion, specifically in the appliance area. These are largely vendor supported, but we want to make sure that we're there, obviously, and we're part of all that. As it relates to the overall, the industry remains pretty rational and pretty stable. You want to make sure that at certain times of the year, you're out there with the relevant offers and that you're doing the things that you need to do. So whether that's in the spring or this Black Friday, we're excited about having some of those offers out there and working within the guardrails and the profitability targets that we've established.\n But all in all, it remains, I think, relatively rational. I think the consumer is looking for value, and so we've got to find different ways to highlight value, and those are the things that this team is doing and value can come a lot of ways outside of just a reduction in price. You can highlight it through new and innovative products. You can highlight it through a special offer if that's what comes out, or we can do it through a vendor-funded promotion. So those are things that we're trying to take advantage of. \nBrandon Sink: And Seth, this is Brandon. I would just add the adjustments that Bill is talking about that we're making as the consumers changing as we're moving through the year, our go-to-market strategy, all of that's fully embedded and reflected in our updated outlook and confidence that we're able to achieve our flat gross margins for the year. \nMarvin Ellison: And Seth on a low price guarantee, our research just indicated that we needed a more simplistic straightforward message to the customers about our value. We had something that was a little too cute, call it, a price promise that I think was way too ambiguous, and we just decided just to keep it simple and stand by the fact that we will support the lowest price in the industry on the products that we sell. We just launched it. We think the timing is perfect going into a holiday season where you have a slightly cautious consumer looking for a value. And so you take everything that Bill said about the definition of value and the fact that we're going to put media behind this lowest price guarantee. We hope that sends a message to the consumer that they could always expect a lowest price at Lowe's. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. That's very helpful. I did have one follow-up on capital allocation, specifically share repurchases. Just based on what you've done year-to-date, where leverage sits today, how do you think about the pace of buybacks from here? Should we be thinking about that starting to slow into the fourth quarter and even over the next couple of quarters based on the demand backdrop. How do we think about that? \nBrandon Sink: Seth, this is Brandon. So our capital allocation priorities unchanged. We're going to continue to invest in the business in high-return projects, targeting a 35% dividend payout ratio and funneling the remainder to share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect funding and share repurchases through operating cash flow here in the near term and expect modest if any share repo in Q4 also expect to be in line with our stated leverage target at the end of the year. So we're also looking at our debt towers, paying those off as they mature. We have $500 million this past Q3. We have $450 million coming due in 2024, and we remain committed to our BBB+ credit rating and expect to manage our leverage accordingly. \nOperator: Next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Given the importance of sales to the PPI initiative, if you're looking at, call it, another down 5% comp next year, do you start to become more aggressive with promotions or other actions in order to start to drive sales because you'll get a return on it in other ways? \nMarvin Ellison: Michael, we're not going to get into 2024 at this time. We'll speak more specifically about that on the Q4 call. What I'll just repeat is PPI is perpetual for a reason. We're going to keep doing it. It's sustainable, it's ongoing, and we're going to be agile. We'll take the necessary steps to make sure we're running a really sound business thinking first about driving service for the customers and giving our associates a great place to work. But other than that, PPI will be in place irrespective of top line, and we'll adjust it accordingly. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is, Morgan, as you look at your sales by market, by region, and tie to the underlying housing characteristics and dynamics in those markets, where are you seeing better trends? And where are you seeing worse trends such that it informs how you think about how the rest of this cycle is going to unfold from here. It's likely at some point, hopefully, housing turnover is going to pick up. That could bode well for home improvement demand. But if it comes with a corresponding tick down in home prices, that could be not so good for home improvement demand. \nMarvin Ellison: Michael, it's a fair question. If you strip out storm overlaps, geographically, our performance is relatively balanced. So there are really no outliers. When you look at markets that had a dramatic run-up in housing costs and some level of moderation, there's really no material impact to our business based on that. Obviously, it's something that we stay very close to. We're paying attention to it. But as of right now, it's not material, and we don't see it as something that's going to affect our business in the near term. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer & Company. \nBrian Nagel: So a couple of questions on top line. I just going to merge them together. But first off, a big follow-up just on appliances. So Morgan, you talked about maybe some normalization in overall promotion vendor way. I guess the question I have on appliances, are you seeing anything shift in the market? I mean obviously, we're against the demand backdrop. But are you seeing anything shift from a competitive standpoint? And then my second question, just with respect to the underlying cadence of the business. We saw, it would appear to be a weakening trends through the fiscal third quarter and then presumably here into the fourth quarter. Anything that you can -- clearly, there's seasonal factors there, but is there anything else you could really call out that they have -- you guys identified as kind of a driver of that we can trend the overall business? \nMarvin Ellison: Michael, I'll take both and just allow Brandon and Bill to jump in if they have any additional comments. On the appliance shift, I mean we're not seeing anything other than what Bill talked about, where you have vendor-funded promotions kind of driving average ticket down. And also, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we're seeing customers being just a little more specific on their purchases going from an entire suite to just a refrigerator as an example.\n And I think this is just the cautious nature of the DIY discretionary spending on some of these bigger ticket cargos we talked about. We already market leader in the U.S. and appliances. And as I mentioned earlier, 14% of our annual revenue is predicated to appliances. And so when the market is soft, we have a disproportionate impact. Having said that, we feel great about our market-leading position. And as Bill outlined, we have some competitive offers on single unit purchases for the holiday season, that's the best in the industry. And so we feel like we're in a good place relative to the marketplace.\n On weakening trends, there's not anything we can put our finger on it. I mean you know all the macro indicators with the resumption of student loan debt and sustained inflation, interest rates. And I just think that those things combined with the fact that people are just choosing to take discretionary dollars and have more experiences with those dollars is really leading into some of the things that we're seeing. And when those discretionary categories are impacted, those are typically DIY-related purchases. And again, at 75% penetration in DIY, we just have a disproportionate impact to that. So I'll let Brandon or Bill add anything else if they have it in addition to what I just said. \nWilliam Boltz: The only thing that I would add, Brian, is that just, as I said earlier, just a reminder that over 100,000 units of appliances break in the marketplace every week. And we've got to be there for that consumer as the market leader, and that's what we're trying to do and do that in a responsible manner to make sure that we can hit all the financial targets that we need to hit. But also make sure that we can meet the customer where they want to be met, both online and in-store. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. And Brian, this is Brandon. Just to wrap it out in terms of how we are looking at Q4. I think our outlook largely a continuation of the macro and the traffic trends that we've experienced in Q3. We do expect a light or a slight impact from lumber deflation as we transition into Q4. All of the offers that Bill has talked about with appliance holiday offers are reflected in there. We do expect some light pressure from cycling Hurricane Ian. So we've triangulated all that. We've looked at 1-, 2-, 4-year trends all of that sort of baked into the expectations that we set, and we believe it's very achievable for us here for Q4. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We'd like to wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving and a wonderful holiday season, and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Lowe's third quarter 2023 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brandon Sink",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Starting with our Q3 results. We generated diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Please note, in the prior year, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $2.1 billion associated with our Canadian retail business. Now my comments from this point will reference comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures from last year were applicable. Q3 sales were $20.5 billion. For reference, prior year sales included $1.2 billion generated in our Canadian retail business.\n Additionally, Q3 results include a $115 million sales headwind due to the shift in our fiscal calendar as we cycle over a 53-week year. Comp sales were down 7.4% as a slowdown in DIY bigger ticket spending offset growth in Pro. Q3 comps were negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points due to lumber deflation. As a reminder, the calendar shift impacted total sales growth, but had no impact on comparable sales as comps are calculated based on weeks 28 through 40 in fiscal 2022. Comparable average ticket was down 0.5%, driven by lumber deflation, more normalized appliance promotions and a decline in big-ticket DIY transactions.\n However, average ticket still increased in the majority of our merchandise categories. Comp transactions declined 6.9%, driven by softer demand in DIY discretionary projects partly offset by positive comp transactions in Pro. Our monthly comps were down 6.3% in August, 8.3% in September and 7.3% in October as DIY traffic slowed as we exited our peak seasonal weeks. Gross margin was 33.7% of sales in the third quarter, up 36 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from our ongoing merchandising PPI initiatives as well as favorable product mix and lower transportation costs. This was partially offset by costs associated with the expansion of our supply chain network and consistent with our year-to-date performance, [ shrink ] was in line with prior year.\n SG&A of 18.4% levered 30 basis points versus prior year adjusted SG&A demonstrating our enterprise-wide agility to manage expenses and drive productivity in a lower sales environment. These results would not have been possible without the exceptional efforts of our store leadership teams to rapidly respond to the sales pressure as well as the ongoing benefits that we are harvesting from our technology-led PPI initiatives. Operating margin rate of 13.2% improved by 46 basis points versus prior year adjusted operating margin. The effective tax rate was 24.6%, in line with prior year adjusted effective tax rate.\n Inventory ended the quarter at $17.5 billion, down $2.3 billion compared to Q3 of last year. U.S. inventory dollars and units were both down compared to last year as we align inventory purchases with sales.\n Turning now to our capital allocation. During the quarter, we generated $485 million in free cash flow. We repurchased 7.3 million shares for $1.6 billion and paid $642 million in dividends at $1.10 per share, returning $2.2 billion to our shareholders. Capital expenditures totaled $579 million as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities within our Total Home strategy. Adjusted debt to EBITDA finished the quarter at 2.72x in line with our stated 2.75x leverage target.\n Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 35%, inclusive of an unfavorable 125 basis point impact related to transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business and the gain we reported in Q1.\n Now turning to our 2023 financial outlook. Given the recent pullback in DIY, bigger ticket discretionary spending and the uncertainty surrounding the macro factors that impact our business, we are updating our full year 2023 financial outlook. With this in mind, we are now forecasting Q4 comp sales to be fairly consistent with Q3 results. Also, the fourth quarter of 2022 included approximately $1.4 billion in sales from the additional 53rd week. We are now expecting 2023 sales of approximately $86 billion with a comparable sales decline of approximately 5%. We also now expect adjusted operating margin of approximately 13.3% and as our ongoing PPI initiatives and disciplined expense management helped to offset volume deleverage pressure from lower sales.\n Additionally, we expect full year interest expense of approximately $1.4 billion, capital expenditures of up to $2 billion and an adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 25%. This results in an updated outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $13.\n Please note that our outlook for operating margin and diluted earnings per share are adjusted to exclude the gain associated with the sale of our Canadian business that we recorded in Q1.\n Finally, we are reconfirming our capital allocation priorities. We will continue to invest in the business to take market share, target a 35% dividend payout ratio and then return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchase, which will be funded in the near term through free cash flow.\n And in closing, I'm confident that our continued investments in our Total Home strategy, our strong balance sheet and our ability to effectively manage our business in any environment will allow navigate the near-term challenges while continuing to deliver sustainable shareholder.\n And with that, we will open it up for questions. Yes. Peter, this is Brandon. Just in terms of as we're looking at 2024, we're in the later stages of our planning process at the moment across the organization. So we're going to hold off on providing any in-depth guidance until our Q4 call. But what I will tell you just in terms of top line macro home improvement, there's continued uncertainty on interest rates, when we're going to see relief when existing home sales are going to turn the corner and begin to improve. And obviously, the ongoing impact of inflation, higher rates on consumer wallet. So we're watching all that. I think to your specific question on margins, we're managing several puts and takes as we look at next year. We're cycling onetime legal settlements, normalization of incentive comp, wage growth, the pacing of our PPI initiative. So we're looking at all that. We're going to take all those factors under consideration as we develop our guide and hold off on providing that until we get to February. Yes, Peter, this is Brandon. I would say just in terms of costs coming into the organization at this point, just from an inflation price action response to that. It's leveled off pretty dramatically here as we move through the year. We've had targets in terms of clawback for this year. We laid those expectations out back in December, I would say, very much pacing in line with those targets. We laid out about $500 million over the course of 3 years. We're leveraging cost management teams, working closely with the merchants, the tech-enabled tools that we've invested in. We have very detailed product cost breakdowns that are informing those negotiations with our suppliers. So we're continuing to be balanced. We're taking a portfolio approach. We're investing in price strategically where needed, but also looking through the lens of protecting our margins. Yes. Simeon, this is Brandon. I wouldn't say when we look at next year, we're losing the benefit of any of those levers. In fact, I think we're looking at where we have opportunities to accelerate. We've talked about PPI, I talked about where we were in that journey in terms of middle innings. Marvin mentioned the conversion of the store technology to a modern omnichannel platform. We got a lot of initiatives stacked up where we expect to see those benefits as that gets delivered next year. Earlier question on transforming the front end really expanding assisted checkout, expanding the BOPIS experience, and then Bill talked in his prepared comments about multiple other kind of merchandising PPI initiatives, whether it's cost clawback, inventory productivity, pricing, promotional strategies, expansion of private brands. So we're really confident in that portfolio of initiatives. We feel like it's in our control. We're managing the road map and the pacing of that and have a lot of confidence as we look at the longer-term margins that we can deliver against our stated targets there. And Seth, this is Brandon. I would just add the adjustments that Bill is talking about that we're making as the consumers changing as we're moving through the year, our go-to-market strategy, all of that's fully embedded and reflected in our updated outlook and confidence that we're able to achieve our flat gross margins for the year. Seth, this is Brandon. So our capital allocation priorities unchanged. We're going to continue to invest in the business in high-return projects, targeting a 35% dividend payout ratio and funneling the remainder to share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect funding and share repurchases through operating cash flow here in the near term and expect modest if any share repo in Q4 also expect to be in line with our stated leverage target at the end of the year. So we're also looking at our debt towers, paying those off as they mature. We have $500 million this past Q3. We have $450 million coming due in 2024, and we remain committed to our BBB+ credit rating and expect to manage our leverage accordingly. Yes. And Brian, this is Brandon.

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter comparable sales decline at 7.4%. Our results were driven by a greater-than-expected pullback and DIY discretionary spending, especially in bigger ticket categories. While we've seen a more cautious consumer for some time now, this quarter, we saw some of these consumers increasingly prioritizing experiences over goods spending on travel and entertainment.\n As a reminder, at Lowe's, 75% of our revenue is driven by DIY customers and 25% by Pros, while the broader market mix is roughly 50% DIY and 50% Pro. As a result, whenever the DIY customer becomes cautious, it disproportionately affects us. And while we face a softer DIY demand in the third quarter, I'm pleased that at the same time, we once again delivered positive sales comp in Pro.\n Now I'd like to take a moment to dig a bit deeper into our DIY performance for the third quarter. In categories like appliances, decor, flooring and kitchen and bath, where we have strong DIY penetration, we saw increased pressure on sales of bigger ticket purchases like appliances where consumers are postponing purchases if they can. For example, customers may have previously bought an entire kitchen suite may now just buy a refrigerator. Keep in mind that the industry-wide pullback in appliance sales has a larger impact on Lowe's since we are the market leader in appliances in the U.S. with 14% of our sales coming from this category. Later in the call, Bill will discuss some of the initiatives we're implementing in Q4 to improve DIY performance with a more targeted effort to reach value-conscious customers including our most competitive offers on single unit appliance purchases ahead of the holiday season and the launch of our Lowe's lowest price guarantee, so our customers can shop with confidence knowing that they'll always find the best price at Lowe's.\n Despite the pullback in DIY, our Pros are still working and many of their projects are a result of increased wear and tear on aging homes, which lead to unavoidable repairs. This continues to create project backlogs for small- to medium-sized Pro, who is our core customer. In our most recent survey, nearly 70% of PROs reported healthy project backlogs, but given the uncertain macro environment, they're feeling a little less confident. Although Pros may be a bit cautious in this environment, our ability to deliver a positive pro sales comp in the third quarter is a reflection that our strategy is working.\n We're making progress with the investments we've made over the last several years to improve our service offering, including increasing loyalty through our MVP Pro rewards, developing a world-class CRM platform, improving job site delivery, enhancing service levels in our stores, creating a more seamless online experience and a number of merchandising initiatives that Bill will discuss later in the call. Overall, we built a competitive pro sales and service model, which is creating a flywheel effect that will enable us to grow Pro sales at 2x the pace of the market.\n Let's now turn to online sales, which declined 4% in the quarter as the same pressures in DIY bigger ticket categories impacted digital sales.\n Now let's talk about what we're doing to manage this unique environment. In store operations, we've made foundational improvements to associate productivity that enable us to effectively align labor to demand while continuing to serve our customers. During the quarter, we leveraged these new capabilities to reduce operating expenses while enhancing the customer experience for both Pro and DIY customers at the same time. Joe will provide more detail on these initiatives and our improved customer service scores later in the call. I'm pleased that our disciplined focus on expense management across the organization contributed to a 46 basis point increase in operating margin rate compared to adjusted operating margin in the prior year despite the sales decline, which led to diluted earnings per share of $3.06.\n As we pull ways to drive improved sales with our DIY customers, I'd like to provide you with an update on two initiatives, our new Lowe's outlet stores and our rural strategy. Let me start with our Lowe's Outlet stores. We opened our 15th Lowe's outlet location in Q3. With these smaller format stores, we can leverage lower cost real estate in trade areas closest to our core customer without cannibalizing a nearby Lowe's store. In an environment where DIY consumers are seeking value, we're pleased with the customer response and the overall performance of our outlet locations. These stores complement our market delivery network, allowing us to offer savings between 25% to 70% off on big and bulky scratch and dent items like appliances, patio furniture, grills, all while maximizing profitability and offering our customers enhanced value. We look forward to discussing the potential growth opportunities of this strategy on an upcoming call.\n Turning to our rule strategy. This one-stop shop concept is designed to give customers located in rural areas across the country, everything they need for their home and farm, including a wide offering of farm, ranch and outdoor products. During the summer, we launched this rural assortment to over 300 stores where we're selling products like livestock feed, pet food, utility vehicles and apparel from brands like Cohort and Wrangler. These programs include a Petco store within a store, which enhances the total home solution we offer by bringing together home improvement and pet care services, products and expertise under one roof.\n We're pleased to see this new initiative already gaining traction with strong performance in pet, apparel and automotive. In fact, these rural customers are our best-performing DIY segment and these stores are performing significantly above the company average. Given this initial success, we're now exploring expanding this rule assortment beyond the original 300 designated rule stores. In addition, we're planning to add incremental merchandising initiatives within these original 300 stores because the customer is responding favorably to these new assortments and product lines.\n Looking ahead, we remain focused on our merchandising and marketing efforts that highlight the everyday value at Lowe's for our price-sensitive customers. And we will continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives within our Total Home strategy as we strive to become a world-class omnichannel retailer.\n And as I wrap up, let me say that we remain bullish on the medium- to long-term outlook for the home improvement industry, supported by favorable housing and demographic trends. We expect home prices to be supported by a persistent supply/demand imbalance of housing, while at the same time, 250,000 millennial household formations are expected per year through 2025, and their parents and grandparents, the baby boomers increasingly prefer to age in place in their own homes. And we cannot overlook the fact that we now have the oldest housing stock in U.S. history with the medium age of homes now 41 years old, which will need ongoing investments in repair and remodel projects. These factors continue to reinforce our optimism about the mid- to long-term outlook for our industry.\n In closing, I'd like to thank our frontline associates with our continued hard work and dedication to serving customers and our communities.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Steven, thanks for the question. We're not going to get into that level of specificity for competitive reasons, but what I will tell you is that the rural stores have exceeded expectations. And as we noted, we started out with roughly 300. But candidly, the performance and the customer response has been such that we're now looking at a couple of different options. One option is we're going into those original 300, and we're add incremental investments initiatives, categories based on feedback from customers. We're also looking at categories that are working really well in those rural stores and asking the question, can we now take some of these categories and put them in nonrural format locations because we believe we could get the same response from customers in nonrural environments.\n And then thirdly, we're just looking at expanding our profile and definition of rule because some of these characteristics, we think can fit other locations. And because of the response and because of the DIY customer being such a critical component of our company strategy, we think this makes a really good strategic rationale and it's something that we're pursuing. But again, we'll speak more about this on future calls, but I don't want to get into more specifics for obvious competitive reasons. And Steve, the other thing that I'll add is this also complements the ongoing omni expansion that Joe talked about. As we extend the capabilities of connecting digital and physical stores, we need more productive space, and we need to just optimize all the things that the associates are going to accommodate and fulfill those orders. And as Joe mentioned, part of this is to create more designated space in a more productive fashion for that process, but also it's creating a much better customer experience, and it's also driving a lot of productivity for Joe's taming the store. Peter, this is Marvin. And the only thing I'll add is you heard in some of your prepared comments, was talking about an old operating system. And we talked a lot about this 30-year-old operating system. There's really been a significant impediment to some of the technology advancements, and we're going to be sunsetting that system at the end of this year, and it's going to just unlock a little bit of acceleration in some of the technology advancements that we have on the project list. We just candidly, we couldn't get to because of this system. And so the good news is we're going to continue to work to Brandon's point on all the elements of running an improved business from a merchandising to operations, supply chain, but also the technology project list over the next 3 to 5 years is robust, and it's going to allow us to continue to find ways to drive profitability, irrespective of the macro environment that we're in. We're hoping the macro environment gets better with the brand at this point. We're going to wait until our Q4 call to talk about '24 and give a much more educated perspective at that time. So Simeon, this is Marvin. I'll add this perspective. The reason why we call this a perpetual productivity improvement initiatives because we're trying to stay away from onetime events. We think that good companies create an ongoing sustained process of improvement and productivity gains. And so we have a road map of initiatives. And it's important that it's not just about store operations. You heard Bill talk about the PPI initiative, specifically for merchandising. If Don Frieson was here, he could speak specifically to supply chain and Seemantini could speak specifically for IT.\n And so this is a culture that we've created here that candidly did not exist, but the key word is perpetual. And that means that it's ongoing, it's consistent and it's sustainable. And so as we look at '24, we know we're not going to get into the details. What Brandon is reinforcing is that we have a list of things that we're going to do. We're well aware of what we're overlapping. We understand some of the onetime factors we're going to face. And we built processes, initiatives in place to address that. And we'll be more transparent and more detail in our Q4 call because we think it's really important to lay out to you all exactly how we see it and the steps we're going to take. So I'll give you the perspective of a long-term operator. If we get the top line, PPI works a whole lot better. So irrespective we're going to intensify the focus. Obviously, if we have a softer top line perspective, we're going to be a lot more aggressive in the PPI side. But irrespective of our comp outlook, PPI is going to be in existence, and we're going to work really hard to make sure that we hit some of the key targets that we lay out. And again, you have our commitment that as we lay out 2024 as best we can, we'll be as transparent as possible about all of these things in our February call. So Chris, I'll take the first part of that, and I'm going to just let Bill Boltz talk about some of the initiatives relative to addressing some of the top line concerns. So specific on sales for us, when we look at the quarter, we look at it from a penetration from a DIY perspective and a product mix. So as a reminder, 14% of our revenue comes from appliances. So when you have pull back on some of these big-ticket categories like appliances, is going to be disproportionately impactful for us.\n Having said that, we look at the Pro and to your point, we had a positive comp, and we're really pleased with that, and I went through some of the investments we've made over the course of the last 4 years that we believe are paying dividends relative to that specific small or medium Pro. And the reason we think that, that specific segment of Pro will remain healthy, although cautious, as we've noted from our survey is because of the age of homes. I mean it is a foregone conclusion that if you have a house over 40 years old, things are going to break. And when those things break and those repairs are required that smaller-to-medium contractor is typically the one that's going to get that call.\n And these pros are incredibly transparent with us and 70% say they feel really good about their backlog. But they also said that when they watch the news and they read the headlines, they're a little cautious because they just don't know what's lurking around the corner, but they're busy because these homes are old. These homes are not turning, so people are living in these homes. And so that's really the driver of that customer segment remaining healthy and busy. And look, we can't predict the bottom. But what we can say is that we're incredibly disciplined. Anytime you can deliver a 46 basis point improvement in operating margin on a negative [ 7.4% ] comp.\n It tells you that there are a lot of really things working from a productivity standpoint that drives margin rate improvement and basis point improvement in customer service that we're really proud of. So we feel good about the execution of the team, and we can't predict kind of what's going to happen when, but we can say whenever it happens, we're well positioned to take advantage of it. And I'll pivot to Bill just to talk about kind of what we're trying to do to remain agile and to try to make sure that we are driving a business environment that's attracting DIY customers and keeping these products coming back also. And Seth on a low price guarantee, our research just indicated that we needed a more simplistic straightforward message to the customers about our value. We had something that was a little too cute, call it, a price promise that I think was way too ambiguous, and we just decided just to keep it simple and stand by the fact that we will support the lowest price in the industry on the products that we sell. We just launched it. We think the timing is perfect going into a holiday season where you have a slightly cautious consumer looking for a value. And so you take everything that Bill said about the definition of value and the fact that we're going to put media behind this lowest price guarantee. We hope that sends a message to the consumer that they could always expect a lowest price at Lowe's. Michael, we're not going to get into 2024 at this time. We'll speak more specifically about that on the Q4 call. What I'll just repeat is PPI is perpetual for a reason. We're going to keep doing it. It's sustainable, it's ongoing, and we're going to be agile. We'll take the necessary steps to make sure we're running a really sound business thinking first about driving service for the customers and giving our associates a great place to work. But other than that, PPI will be in place irrespective of top line, and we'll adjust it accordingly. Michael, it's a fair question. If you strip out storm overlaps, geographically, our performance is relatively balanced. So there are really no outliers. When you look at markets that had a dramatic run-up in housing costs and some level of moderation, there's really no material impact to our business based on that. Obviously, it's something that we stay very close to. We're paying attention to it. But as of right now, it's not material, and we don't see it as something that's going to affect our business in the near term. Michael, I'll take both and just allow Brandon and Bill to jump in if they have any additional comments. On the appliance shift, I mean we're not seeing anything other than what Bill talked about, where you have vendor-funded promotions kind of driving average ticket down. And also, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we're seeing customers being just a little more specific on their purchases going from an entire suite to just a refrigerator as an example.\n And I think this is just the cautious nature of the DIY discretionary spending on some of these bigger ticket cargos we talked about. We already market leader in the U.S. and appliances. And as I mentioned earlier, 14% of our annual revenue is predicated to appliances. And so when the market is soft, we have a disproportionate impact. Having said that, we feel great about our market-leading position. And as Bill outlined, we have some competitive offers on single unit purchases for the holiday season, that's the best in the industry. And so we feel like we're in a good place relative to the marketplace.\n On weakening trends, there's not anything we can put our finger on it. I mean you know all the macro indicators with the resumption of student loan debt and sustained inflation, interest rates. And I just think that those things combined with the fact that people are just choosing to take discretionary dollars and have more experiences with those dollars is really leading into some of the things that we're seeing. And when those discretionary categories are impacted, those are typically DIY-related purchases. And again, at 75% penetration in DIY, we just have a disproportionate impact to that. So I'll let Brandon or Bill add anything else if they have it in addition to what I just said."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone.\n Despite a pullback in DIY discretionary demand, we are pleased that we delivered positive Pro comps this quarter as our enhanced product and brand offerings continue to resonate with the Pro. Over the past several years, we've added the brands that Pros want, and we have invested in the inventory quantities pros need, and we continue to tailor our product assortments to local building codes and preferences. These investments continue to pay off even in a more challenging macro environment, where we remain laser-focused on highlighting everyday value and convenience, both in our stores and online to a price-conscious consumer.\n Turning to our results in Building Products. We continue to serve our Resilient Pro customer who remains active, especially on repair and maintenance projects. We delivered positive comps in building materials, partly driven by strong performance in Pro-heavy categories like roofing and drywall. We also delivered comps above the company average in rough plumbing, largely driven by positive comps in water heaters demonstrating that Lowe's is the go-to solution for critical repair needs. This quarter, Klein Tools returned home to Lowe's. This trusted brand is the #1 tool brand for electrical and HVAC professionals, and we are thrilled to now offer the largest assortment of Klein Tools in the home improvement retail channel. Our Pro customers' response to our relaunch of Klein tools has exceeded our expectations, and we're excited about our plans to expand this iconic brand to support the unique needs of these trade professionals.\n Now let's shift gears to home decor, which was most heavily impacted by lower DIY project-related demand. And as you heard from Marvin, this had a greater impact in categories like appliances, flooring and kitchens and back. Within appliances, we are seeing lower industry unit volumes as well as the reintroduction of pre-pandemic levels of vendor-funded promotion, which puts pressure on average selling price. And while our results in kitchens and bath were also impacted by softer DIY demand. We are seeing our private brand products gaining traction as the consumer continues to look for value, like with our new allen + roth butcher block countertops. These are made of solid FSC-certified wood and this stylish product is a cost-effective way to refresh your kitchen, bar or studio. This item has been so popular that we are now doubling our sales expectations.\n Turning to paint. We delivered comps above company average in the quarter, largely driven by the Pro paint, who relies on Lowe's as a one-stop shop for their project needs. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our product offering, including a recent launch of an exclusive line of Sherwin-Williams primers from HGTV Home. These new primers designed for the Pro who paints, gives them a versatile multi-surface application that makes it easier to work on both interior and exterior projects.\n Shifting gears to hardlines. In addition to a broad-based DIY pullback, we also saw pressure in categories impacted by storm-related activity. such as generators, gas cans, fuel and chain saws as we cycled Hurricane Ian from last year. We delivered comps above company average in lawn and garden as our customers engaged in smaller fall cleanup projects. And we also drove comps above company average in hardware led by key Pro categories like fasteners, safety equipment and cleaning products.\n Lastly, we continue to build out our brand portfolio like with our new strategic partnership with the Toro Company. Their exciting product lineup further complements what is now the strongest brand offering in outdoor power equipment, one that resonates with both the Pro and DIY customer who relies on Lowe's to offer the best selection. We're looking forward to launching Toro ahead of our upcoming spring season and building on our momentum as the leading retailer of outdoor power equipment.\n In response to the customers' increased focus on value, I'd like to talk about how we are highlighting some of the ways that customers can save time and money during this holiday season. For starters, we recently kicked off our holiday campaign with a commitment to supporting shoppers in new ways, all season long, which includes a wave of exciting offers and new deals every week, on great gift ideas, including power tools from some of the best brands like DEWALT, Craftsman and Cobalt and pre-lit Christmas trees, trimmed with the innovative energy-saving LED lighting. Our customers can also look forward to same-day delivery on key holiday and home improvement items as well as services like holiday light hanging for the home through A&G.\n And as Marvin mentioned, we recently launched our new Lowe's Lowest Price Guarantee to remind customers that not only can they expect a great shopping experience, but they will also receive the lowest price on items for their home. In fact, Customers can now find our lowest prices of the year on select major appliances. And in an effort to simplify the offer and make it easier to understand, we're offering $100 off for every $800 a customer spends. For our Pros, we have tailored exclusive bulk saving offers on appliances as well and to drive even greater excitement and traffic on Black Friday, we will feature more than 10 major appliance doorbusters. We are excited to deliver what we think will be the most compelling offers in the market.\n In addition to these great deals, Lowe's is now offering Carhartt apparel online and in select stores. This iconic workwear brand makes a perfect gift for the Pro this holiday.\n Before I close, I'd like to highlight just a few of the perpetual productivity improvements or PPI work streams that are underway in merchandising. Our teams continue to make progress in our three main focus areas: product cost management, inventory productivity and pricing and promotional strategies.\n We continue to partner with our suppliers to take cost out, especially now that transportation and commodity costs have come down. And we are expanding our private brand portfolio, which delivers great quality and value at a lower price to our customers, while also driving better margin rate productivity. Our teams are working hard to ensure that customers have the best value every day at Lowe's, while also delivering productivity for the organization.\n And as I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation once again to our vendors and our merchants for their hard work, dedication and ongoing partnership.\n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Yes. So as Joe said, we've got roughly 450 stores that we'll complete by the end of the year. We continue to test and learn in these stores. As you can imagine, there's opportunities for us to try some additional merchandising opportunities up front of the store. It's all about getting another item in the basket, and there's opportunities in the obvious areas like snacks and drinks, but we're also looking at other categories as well that can complement what we're doing and also that shopper, both a Pro and a do-it-yourselfer that's making that transaction in our store that could pick that kind of stuff up and you think about like aspirin, band-aid, stuff like that, that could complement what they're doing and could be used on a job site or in a glove box of a car at your home. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And Chris, just some of the things that we've talked about really over the last few quarters that I'm pleased with the work that the team has done is the continued acquiring of brands and making sure that we've got relevant assortments inside of our stores and online. And so we announced today Toro as part of our outdoor power equipment. We talked about Klein last quarter, and we're just starting to get that brand now into the electrical and the tool category. So that's excitement for us. We talked about localized assortments and Marvin touched briefly on the rural strategy. That's just one element of a localized opportunity.\n And then we continue to try to pivot to where the customer is. So as -- we've seen some of the softening in appliances from an industry-wide standpoint, because we're the industry leader here, we want to make sure that we can meet the customer where they want us to meet them, and that's adjusting. And so we feel like the adjustments the teams have made to make sure that we can go after the 100,000-plus appliances that break in the United States every single week that we're there when the consumer needs us both online and in-store. We continue to enhance our fundamentals and our foundation online. And so offering Apple Pay as a way to make it easier for the customer to transact online. This is just one element, same-day delivery and then obviously being seasonally relevant.\n As we go into this Friday with Black Friday, it's about making sure that we've got strong offers out there that gets the customer to the door into the website. And that's the stuff that we'll continue to do. And at the same time, we have to be competitively priced. We've got to be relevant every single day. And so that's the kind of work that the team continues to stay focused on. And it takes time, obviously, to get that customer to know that these changes have happened inside of our store and online, and we're just going to just stay focused on what we can control. Yes, Seth, it's Bill. And so just a couple of things here. As I said, we are seeing probably more of a move on pre-pandemic levels of promotion, specifically in the appliance area. These are largely vendor supported, but we want to make sure that we're there, obviously, and we're part of all that. As it relates to the overall, the industry remains pretty rational and pretty stable. You want to make sure that at certain times of the year, you're out there with the relevant offers and that you're doing the things that you need to do. So whether that's in the spring or this Black Friday, we're excited about having some of those offers out there and working within the guardrails and the profitability targets that we've established.\n But all in all, it remains, I think, relatively rational. I think the consumer is looking for value, and so we've got to find different ways to highlight value, and those are the things that this team is doing and value can come a lot of ways outside of just a reduction in price. You can highlight it through new and innovative products. You can highlight it through a special offer if that's what comes out, or we can do it through a vendor-funded promotion. So those are things that we're trying to take advantage of. The only thing that I would add, Brian, is that just, as I said earlier, just a reminder that over 100,000 units of appliances break in the marketplace every week. And we've got to be there for that consumer as the market leader, and that's what we're trying to do and do that in a responsible manner to make sure that we can hit all the financial targets that we need to hit. But also make sure that we can meet the customer where they want to be met, both online and in-store."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our frontline associates for their ongoing efforts to deliver excellent customer service. As Marvin mentioned, we were able to reduce operating expenses this quarter, while at the same time delivering a 200 basis point improvement in DIY customer satisfaction scores and a 300 basis point improvement for the Pro. This represents the ongoing benefit of our foundational technology investments, designed to modernize our stores operational process and simplify our associates' jobs while also creating a great shopping environment for our customers.\n Let me highlight just a few of these changes. For starters, we created an industry-leading customer-centric scheduling system, which allows us to predict customer demand and align staffing around peak customer traffic for each store and each department. This system creates enhanced operational agility so we can rapidly adjust as demand patterns shift. Second, we've enabled greater productivity by putting mobile smart devices in all of our associates' hands to make them more efficient, reducing manual tasking and enabling faster customer service. For example, by integrating smart devices with our new store inventory management system, or SIMS, our associates can find products 40% faster.\n And through Project Simple, we've eliminated duplicative tasks and reduced nonproductive hours, so we can re-purpose associate time from tasking to selling and service. A third foundational improvement is the expansion of our merchandising services team or MST. This team keeps our shelves stocked, and they recently assumed responsibilities for price changes across the store and watering in the garden center. MST is now leveraging a new app that directs them to serve a specific base based on the rate of sales, making their hard work even more productive and freeing up more time for our Red Best associates to spend with customers.\n Another important aspect of delivering excellent customer experience is convenience. That's why we're making a number of enhancements to create a more convenient shopping experience ahead of the holiday season.\n For example, we're extending our same-day delivery to in-store purchases through our gig network to both Pro and DIY customers. And in certain locations, we'll even be delivering live Christmas trees to our customers' doors saving them the hassle of getting it home themselves. This new gig delivery capability, which we first rolled out on lowes.com, enables us to tap into the One Rail network of 12 million drivers to deliver directly to Pro job sites and customer homes in just a matter of hours.\n Our store operations team is also focused on unlocking even more productivity through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. This past quarter, we fully retired the old self-checkout systems and have shifted to the proprietary self-checkout systems that we've built for the home improvement shopper. We've seen greater customer adoption of these new systems since they're so much easier to use. In fact, our front-end transformation is well underway, with approximately 450 stores planned by the end of this year. Over a 3-year time line, we're revamping the checkout experience across all of our stores and increasing the selling space at the front where we're adding more merchandise right of checkout with a new design that makes it easy to showcase grab-and-go items. And with this front-end transformation, we're shifting to an easy-to-use assisted self-checkout with cashiers who will be right there to answer questions and help customers when they need it.\n Finally, we're tripling the staging area for buy online, pick up in store orders to support increased online sales and create a much faster, easier customer experience building on our momentum when it comes to driving improved customer service scores for these orders. At the same time, we're excited to launch omni selling in our stores, a critical milestone in our journey to become a world-class omnichannel retailer, enabled by our new store operating system, we can now easily sell our endless aisle on Lowes.com within the aisles of our stores. For example, let's say, a customer is shopping for new faucets and browsing our selection of the most popular finishes in the store.\n While talking with an associate, they decide to go with the unique finish from Lowes.com that the associate highlights on their mobile device. The associate then saves the faucet in the customer's digital cart with their phone number and the customer can continue shopping in the store. When the customer is ready to check out, all the cashier needs to do to combine the digital and physical purchases is pull up the digital cart using the customer's phone number. We're still in the early innings here, but we know this is a great opportunity to drive our omni sales and make sure our customers get everything they need to complete their project in one shopping trip.\n As I close, I would like to thank all of our store leaders and associates once again for their hard work serving customers and delivering results each and every day. Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Brandon. Chris, thanks for the question. And listen, we can tell you that with the firm loyalty and CRM that we launched, we continue to view the basket. We continue to view the mix. We are very encouraged and continue to exceed expectation in the core metrics. And we continue to launch new capabilities, things like online quotes for the bulk pricing that Bill talked about. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned the integrated same-day gig delivery, streamlined order tracking. And so there's a lot going into that pro from an effort standpoint. And so we continue to be pleased at the progress."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe's Companies First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2023. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings.\n Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our comparable sales declined 4.3%, driven by approximately 350 basis points of lumber deflation, unfavorable weather and lower DIY discretionary sales. We continue to build momentum with the Pro through our MVPs Pro Rewards program and our expanded assortment of Pro national brands.  Lumber deflation disproportionately impacted Pro sales by approximately 800 basis points of comp pressure and despite this pressure, comparable Pro sales were slightly positive in Q1 with broad-based strength across multiple categories. This positive comp in Pro builds on top of a 22% U.S. Pro comp in the first quarter of last year.  \n DIY sales were pressured by delayed spring and lower-than-expected discretionary demand, although we are encouraged to see better trends in periods of favorable weather. A late start to spring disproportionately impacts do-it-yourself customers who represent 75% of our business, given many seasonal categories are heavily concentrated in DIY. As weather improves, we're optimistic that customers will reengage with spring projects, and we are ready to support the increased demand with our best in-stock position and staffing levels in 3 years, coupled with improved omnichannel and fulfillment capabilities. However, we are expecting a pullback in discretionary consumer spending over the near term. Given these trends, we're updating our full year outlook this morning.\n Despite market pressures, we are pleased to see market share gains this quarter, and we expect to continue to outpace the market as we execute against the growth initiatives of our Total Home strategy. We're also confident in our ability to drive continued productivity through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. This operational discipline and agility helped us to offset the impact of lower sales and higher wage costs in Q1.\n Adjusted operating margin expanded 47 basis points in the first quarter, leading to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.67, a 5% increase compared to last year. While we can't control commodity deflation, weather or macroeconomic uncertainty, we can control how effectively we operate our business and adapt to a changing environment.\n A key component of our transformation that is often overload is the culture of continuous improvement we've introduced at Lowe's, which is the foundation of our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives. And although our PPI initiatives originated operations, we're now focused on driving productivity across all areas of the company. And we see tremendous runway ahead for continued productivity across the business including dozens of PPI work streams in merchandising, store operations, supply chain and corporate support functions.\n As an example, we're replacing our 30-year-old operating system with a modern omnichannel architecture that will enable a seamless, intuitive customer experience while removing complexity for associates. This project has been underway for 4 years, and we are pleased that we are on track to retire all legacy green screens by the end of this year. This new modern operating system will allow us to unlock a significant amount of labor productivity and deploy new capabilities including enabling more seamless omnichannel selling for within our stores.\n In addition to our new operating system, our penetration of rural stores gives us an opportunity to drive sustainable profit growth due to the much lower expense base that's required to operate these stores. As an example, what we spend to operate our store in Philadelphia, Mississippi is significantly less than the cost to operate one of our stores in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While in years past, our penetration of rural and remote stores was viewed as a competitive disadvantage, we now expect that these stores will be a key component of our operating profit growth over the next 3 to 5 years. Given our confidence in this trajectory, we set long-term targets of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in incremental productivity gains at our December Analyst and Investor Conference and we are tracking our progress against those initiatives on a monthly, if not, a weekly basis.\n In addition to our disciplined focus on productivity, this quarter, we also continued to make strides with our Total Home strategy. And in Pro, our growth was fueled by continued acceleration of our MVPs Pro Rewards Program and CRM tool, coupled with our improved Pro assortment, inventory depth and omnichannel capabilities. These initiatives have enabled us to continue to gain traction with our core Pro customer, which is a small to medium-sized Pro. Joe will discuss some of the exciting new Pro initiatives later in the call.  \n Our online sales also accelerated this quarter with 6% comparable sales growth, representing more than a 10% sales penetration. Online growth was supported by an increase in Pro sales as we continue to upgrade our Pro digital experience with new tools and personalization. We also continue to enhance our DIY online experience by making home improvement projects easier for consumers to visualize, estimate and shop. And these investments are paying off with higher online conversions and attachment rates.  \n In supply chain, we continue to roll out our market delivery model, bringing us to 12 geographic regions across the country, supporting more than 1,100 stores. And we're pleased that this more efficient model of delivering big and bulky products is already enabling us to accelerate our market share gains and appliances and will enable future growth in other big and bulky product categories. And we remain on schedule to have market delivery rolled out by the end of 2023.  \n And despite a macroeconomic environment with mixed signals creating near-term pressures, we remain optimistic about the future of home improvement. And once we navigate through this uncertainty, we remain bullish on the long-term outlook for our industry due to the unique convergence of structural drivers and demographic trends that are supportive of home improvement demand. And we feel fortunate to operate in such a favorable sector of retail, where 2/3 of our sales remain nondiscretionary. And as we navigate this near-term pressure, we will continue to monitor trends closely and we are confident that we have the agility needed to quickly adapt to any scenario.\n In closing, I'd like to thank our frontline associates for their continued hard work and dedication to supporting our customers and our communities.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, 5 of our 14 merchandising categories were positive, building materials, rough plumbing, paint, hardware and appliances. We continue to see broad-based Pro strength across all 3 merchandising divisions. In home decor, paint and appliances delivered the strongest comps this quarter. Our momentum in appliances continues to build as we drove higher unit sales and work to continue to take market share by leveraging our improved omnichannel shopping experience, enhanced market delivery capabilities and expanded assortment.\n Appliances are a great example of an omnichannel category, where customers often compare options online, then visit our showroom to see products in-person and then get their questions answered by one of our appliance specialists. And with our improved online capabilities like easy scheduling and order tracking, we continue to see more and more of our customers getting comfortable completing their purchases online. In the U.S., we estimate that roughly 100,000 appliances break every day. So our investments in fast appliance delivery and a seamless omnichannel shopping experience, positions us well as the go-to destination for these urgent and often nondiscretionary needs.\n We are also seeing increased demand in paint, especially from our Pros who paint as they take advantage of our paint job site delivery, our MVPs Paint Rewards Program and our improved product assortment. This quarter, we took the next step in catering to these important customers by launching Spec Right interior paint in partnership with Sherwin-Williams. This is our first exclusive line of tintable paint formulated specifically for Pros.\n Within decor, we recently launched new closet organization solutions across 4 private brands to meet a range of storage needs and budgets. This includes modular, easy-to-install wood or wire closet systems that are modern, customizable and a far better value than the competition. Our private brand strategy allows us to deliver value to DIY customers who are looking for high-quality, on-trend products at more affordable price points which enables us to provide differentiation, loyalty and profitability.\n Turning to building products. Building materials and rough plumbing led the way. In building materials, we saw broad-based strength, reflecting the investments we made to improve our Pro offering through an enhanced assortment. You may remember, last year, when we announced a new 10-foot fiberglass rebar known as PINKBAR by Owens Corning. This product exceeded our sales expectation given its strength, lightweight materials and corrosion resistance. This year, we're building on that success with the new 20-foot PINKBAR product, designed to help Pros reinforce bigger structures using fewer connections, ultimately saving them time and money on material costs.\n Rough plumbing was driven by strength in water heaters, HVAC, plumbing repair and pipe and fittings. As we continue to strengthen our offering for the Pro and the DIY consumer in these categories. And while lumber comps were pressured by steep year-over-year lumber deflation, the category had the highest unit comp in the company this quarter, reflecting strong Pro demand. We are pleased with our continued enhancements to our strong assortment of Pro products from trusted brands like Bosch, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, Hubbell, ITW, Klein Tools, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Matabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.\n In hardlines, our performance was pressured by the delayed spring, some volatile weather in the West and softer discretionary spending. However, we did see higher demand during periods where weather improved. In lawn and garden, we proactively partnered with our live goods vendors to increase our agility in responding to changing weather patterns, which was critical in a season marked by erratic weather. Our live good vendors play a key role each spring as we continue to refine our local offerings in addition to the timing of when product arrives to our stores.\n This year, they help support our new Green Vest program, where our merchandising service team or MST associates, along with support from our vendors, now provides service to our garden centers, taking the tasks off the shoulders of our Red Vest associates to allow them to focus on serving the customer. We also continue to expand our private brand offering including a full lineup of new and innovative lawn fertilizers and grass seed products through our Sta-Green brand, which is already exceeding our expectations.\n And in hardware, in addition to delivering a positive comp, we also saw strong attachment rates alongside the higher lumber unit sales and strength in building materials, powered by the improved assortments of the key fastening brands like SPAX, GRK, FastenMaster, ITW and Power Pro One. As we continue to enhance our assortments at a national level, we also continue to advance our localization work. This is a key pillar of our Total Home strategy with the goal of expanding market share, increasing inventory productivity and protecting our margins. We have been piloting a localized framework for a few common market categories like rural and urban stores. Today, I'm excited to announce we are now scaling our rural framework to as many as 300 additional stores by year-end, with a wider offering of farm, ranch and outdoor products that positions Lowe's as a one-stop shop to make it convenient for rural customers to get what they need in one shopping trip.\n Our rural format includes broader product offerings in categories such as pet, livestock, trailers, fencing, utility vehicles, specialized hardware and our new Carhartt Apparel, all designed to meet the unique needs and preferences of rural homeowners who work and play outdoors.  Given our rural store footprint, and long-standing relationships in these communities, we see this as a natural opportunity for our business and one that will simplify the shopping experience for these very valuable customers. And as Marvin mentioned, we see the productivity improvements in these stores as a key component to delivering sustainable growth in our operating profit.\n We also remain focused on our many merchandising PPI initiatives, including leveraging our modernized cost optimization tools to negotiate costs with vendors and we're getting more strategic and surgical in our inventory planning to focus on more high-velocity core inventory items with low markdown risk like Pro replenishment and fewer slow velocity SKUs.\n From a technology standpoint, in the first quarter, we completed the rollout of new dedicated Zebra smartphones for all MST associates ahead of schedule. These devices are equipped with the new MST app designed to optimize their time with technology that leapfrogs the competition. The system automatically prioritize planogram changes, pricing updates, base service and other projects to optimize associates' time on the most efficient, highest value next task. And it also gives associates step-by-step instructions to maximize productivity and minimize the learning curve for new associates. This app was built internally to seamlessly integrate with our other mobile apps.\n For example, each time an MST associate resets a bay, the product location automatically updates in our associate product app and our customer mobile app. So both associates and customers can quickly find what they're looking for. As I close, I'd like to again extend my appreciation to our vendors and our merchants for their partnership, hard work, innovation and continued support.\n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. At Lowe's, we are committed to being the employer of choice in retail for associates to choose to build their careers. As a reflection of this commitment over the last 3 years, we have increased the hourly rate for our store associates by 20%. And since 2018, we have invested over $3 billion in incremental wage and share-based compensation for our frontline associates. As a result of our consistent and ongoing commitment to our hourly associates, we are seeing our best staffing levels in 3 years, improved retention and the highest customer satisfaction scores in our company's history.\n In addition to compensation, we are also taking other steps to show appreciation to our associates, including simple initiatives like lowering the prices of the food in our store break rooms and closing our stores on Easter for the fourth consecutive year. These expressions of appreciation may not sound overly complex, but to our hourly associates, they matter.  As a former hourly associate, one way I measure improved associate engagement is by tracking the number of people who transition their jobs into careers. More than 85% of leadership roles are now filled from within up nearly 700 basis points over the last 2 years.\n Our frontline associates deserve all the credit for the transformation of our company, and I would like to personally thank all of our associates for everything they do to support each other, our customers and our communities.\n Now let me transition to Pro, one of the highlights in the first quarter. I'm excited to announce that we've just launched new Pro online business tools, the latest enhancement to our MVPs Pro Rewards program, which is designed to make Pros of all sizes feel like MVPs at Lowe's. Through our surveys, we learned Pros would welcome time-saving tools that help them shop quickly and minimize time away from the job site. At the same time, we learned our Pro associates spend a lot of time building quotes and checking order status, tasked to take them away from serving customers in their stores.\n To solve for both needs, we launched a suite of tools on lowes.com and our mobile app that make it easy for Pros to manage their orders from anywhere, whether that's on-the-job site, at home or out of town. Rather than having to drive to our stores to get a quote, Pros can now build and update online quotes in minutes. It automatically applies to their volume savings pricing and discounts and lets them quickly download a PDF quote for their customers. They can also use order tracking to track the status of the order throughout the fulfillment process.\n Pros tell us they love how easy and simple these tools are. In one Pro's words, he appreciates the convenience of being able to get a price, get it ordered and get it done. While these tools just launched in April, we are already seeing better-than-expected adoption rate and sales growth and expect results to accelerate as more Pros discover the new features. Our traction with Pros online is just one example of the momentum we are seeing in our MVPs Pro Rewards Program and one of the reasons we delivered a positive sales comp in Pro for Q1.\n Pros enrolled in our loyalty program continue to shop more frequently and buy more per trip and spend more overall. As our CRM tool matures, we are using data insights to identify trends that can improve our marketing and sales strategy, including tailoring our offerings by trade and by tier. These improved Pro capabilities and offerings are reflected in our Pro customer satisfaction scores, which are up 200 basis points over last year. In our April survey, over 75% of Pros continue to say their backlogs are healthy. While the Pro backlogs remain consistent with recent quarters, Pros did report a shift to smaller project sizes.\n Moving on to productivity. We continue to scale a series of perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. First, we remain laser-focused on technology modernization across all areas of our stores including rapidly replacing legacy self-checkout systems with our proprietary self-checkout registers. We are encouraged to see higher customer adoption, throughput, labor productivity and customer satisfaction on these registers and will complete all remaining stores later this year.\n We've also matured our new store inventory management system, or SIMS, which continues to improve our inventory visibility and operational efficiency. It also fully integrates with the mobile apps Bill just mentioned, reducing the time both associates and customers spend searching for product. We also continue to enhance our pick up in store experience to streamline processes and enhanced technology. These improvements drove faster fulfillment and a 400-basis point increase in pickup in store customer satisfaction scores in the first quarter.\n As we approach Memorial Day, I'd like to thank any veterans listening in for their service. As a marine who served combat tours in the Gulf War and Desert Storm, I'm proud of Lowe's long-standing history of giving back to our military community including a 10% military discount. And we are proud to support these customers who have given so much to our country.\n As I close, I would like to thank all our store leaders and associates once again for their hard work to serve customers, drive results and improve this business each and every day.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon. \nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Joe. Beginning with our Q1 results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.77 compared to $3.51 last year. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. Non-GAAP measures have been adjusted to exclude the gain associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business.\n In the quarter, we recognized a net pretax gain of $63 million on deferred consideration associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business. Excluding this benefit, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.67, an increase of 5% compared to prior year. Q1 sales were $22.3 billion, which includes approximately $735 million related to a shift in our fiscal calendar as we cycle over a 53-week year. Also, as a reminder, prior year sales included $1.2 billion generated in our Canadian retail business.\n As Marvin mentioned, comparable sales were down 4.3%, partly driven by a later start to spring and a more cautious consumer. This also includes approximately 350 basis points of lumber deflation. Please note that comparable sales are calculated based on weeks 2 through 14 in fiscal 2022. Comparable average ticket was down 0.3%, largely driven by lumber deflation as ticket increased in the majority of our other merchandise divisions. Comp transactions declined 4% due to the delayed start of spring and lower-than-expected DIY discretionary sales. Our monthly comps were down 3% in February. With unfavorable weather patterns across the country in March and April, comps declined 5.4% and 3.9%, respectively.\n Lower sales in seasonal categories pressured sales by approximately $400 million in the quarter, or approximately 175 basis points. Gross margin was 33.7% of sales in the first quarter, down 35 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from a favorable product mix, offset by costs associated with the expansion of our supply chain network.  There was no meaningful impact from shrink or credit revenue in the quarter. Also keep in mind that product margin in the prior year quarter reflected a timing benefit driven by product cost inflation. Adjusted SG&A of 17.4% of sales levered 79 basis points. As Marvin mentioned, this performance reflects an enterprise-wide disciplined focus on PPI that helped offset pressure from lower sales and wage investments. It also includes the benefit of a onetime legal settlement.\n Adjusted operating margin rate of 14.4% of sales levered 47 basis points. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.6% in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $19.5 billion, down $0.7 billion compared to Q1 of last year. As a reminder, prior year inventory levels includes our Canadian retail business. U.S. inventory units finished the quarter slightly down to last year.\n Now turning to our 2023 financial outlook. Given the higher-than-expected pullback we've seen in home improvement spending, we are now expecting our relevant market, which reflects our 75% DIY, 25% Pro mix to be down mid-single digits this year. But while we are seeing lower-than-expected DIY discretionary demand, we are also driving better-than-expected results in Pro and continued strength in our online sales and core categories like appliances and paint. This reinforces our confidence that we will continue to take market share and outperform the broader market.\n We are now expecting 2023 sales of $87 million to $89 billion with comparable sales expected to range from down 2% to down 4%. Please note that the updated outlook also reflects the impact of lower-than-expected lumber prices. This creates an incremental 50 basis points of pressure on full year sales as compared to our original expectations. We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY for the year as Pro backlogs are healthy, and demand for Pro services remain strong. We now expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 13.4% to 13.6% for the full year driven by PPI initiatives across the company, partly offset by planned wage investments and lower sales volumes. We expect capital expenditures of up to $2 billion this year and with our planned share repurchases, we expect to reach our 2.75x leverage target by the end of the year while maintaining our BBB+ credit rating.\n Finally, we are also updating our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in a range of $13.20 to $13.60. Keep in mind that our outlook for operating margin and diluted earnings per share are now adjusted to exclude the gain associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business that we recorded in the first quarter.\n To assist you with your modeling, I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations for the second quarter. We are expecting an approximately $400 million headwind to sales due to the timing shift in our fiscal calendar. We also expect lumber deflation to pressure Q2 sales by approximately 150 basis points. Finally, we expect $250 million benefit to sales from the delayed spring. Taking all of this into account, we are expecting Q2 sales towards the higher end of our full year guide. We are also expecting adjusted operating margins slightly above prior year results, partly due to the impact of the shift in our fiscal calendar as well as the timing of several productivity initiatives that are already in flight.\n Turning to our capital allocation strategy. During the quarter, the company generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased 10.6 million shares for $2.1 billion and paid $633 million in dividends at $1.05 per share, returning $2.8 billion to our shareholders. Capital expenditures totaled $380 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We ended Q1 with $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents which includes proceeds from our $3 billion notes offering in March. We ended Q1 at 2.62x adjusted debt to EBITDA. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 28%, inclusive of a 725-basis point impact related to transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business and the discrete gain in Q1.\n In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our Total Home strategy while navigating near-term market uncertainty. And we remain committed to our best-in-class capital allocation strategy centered around delivering sustainable shareholder value.\n And with that, we will open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. \nElizabeth Lane: So I think previously, we had heard a lot of focus on higher sales per square foot as the main driver of operating margin improvement. Now I think you guys are talking more about the benefits of operating in lower-cost markets like the more rural stores. So presumably, those stores have lower sales per square foot in your stores in more densely populated markets. So how are you thinking about geographic mix and potential for stores benching going forward if those more rural areas are now looking more attractive? \nMarvin Ellison: Liz, this is Marvin. I think it's more in tune with what Bill talked about with some of the investments we're making in those rural stores. As we survey those customers, they give us a list of things they wish they could purchase in one shopping occasion and some of those types of things like Carhartt Apparel, farm and ranch types of items and categories as part of our expansion opportunity. And we think by doing those types of initiatives, we're going to see sales per square foot actually improve. \n As a matter of fact, when we look at the pilot stores where we've been very diligent on going after those specific categories, we actually saw that within the pilot locations. And so that is leading us into this roughly 300 store expansion of these extended categories. And we just see this as a unique opportunity. I mentioned that the expense base is lower. But as you said, if you can have a lower expense base, then you can improve sales per square footage, that in a combination of all the other initiatives we're doing around the company, we think will continue to drive our profit growth. And I'll let Brandon add any additional comments. \nBrandon Sink: Liz, this is Brandon. Just as we think about the CapEx, as Marvin mentioned, we're not necessarily looking at opening stores over the long term is really part of our core strategy, but we love what we're seeing with these rural stores. We initially piloted on a smaller subset of locations. We love the profit profile of these stores within these rural markets, and we've been very thoughtful around the assortments and where we're rolling out and really excited to see this scale as we move through 2023 and what this can deliver from a top line perspective beyond that. \nElizabeth Lane: Great. And in those stores, just as a follow-up, are you seeing online penetration that's similar to your overall company average? Or is it a little bit lower? Is it higher? Just curious if there's any difference in the online mix? \nMarvin Ellison: Liz, it's about the same, but I mentioned in my prepared comments that we're retiring this old legacy operating system and by retiring this system, it opens up the ability to have really true omnichannel selling in the store. So we see omnichannel and e-commerce growth only accelerating with the ability of our 300-plus thousand associates having the ability to more easily transact in the store, thus connecting physical and digital in a more seamless way. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\n Mr. Hovers, perhaps you're muted.\n Okay. I'm going to move on to our next question, which is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Can you hear me? \nMarvin Ellison: Yes, we can, Simeon. \nSimeon Gutman: My question is, first, I'm trying to sort out the guidance. If you take the Q2 through Q4, what's embedded, both for sales and margin, is that roughly the same as what it was, call it, when you guided a year? Or has anything changed. \nBrandon Sink: Simeon, thanks for the question. This is Brandon. Let me just kind of speak a little bit to the curve specifically. When we look at Q2 as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, expecting Q2 sales towards the higher end of the full year guide. That's inclusive of the $250 million delayed spring benefit, offset by the 150 basis points lumber deflation and then the $400 million, week shift drag. As we start to transition and look at the second half, we do expect the Pro business is going to continue to outperform and drive our growth. We mentioned that backlogs remained healthy and we expect that business to continue to outpace DIY. \n The lumber inflation is -- or deflation is going to moderate as we start to look at second half and we cycle over more normal pricing over the balance of the year and then continued strength in what we're seeing with the online business and in core DIY businesses like appliances and paint. So taking all that into account when we look at the second half, we're looking at that in line with the full year guide. \nSimeon Gutman: That's helpful. And then maybe a follow-up, sticking with the guidance. If you looked at whether it was the weak or even the moderate cases beforehand, margins were going to hold up reasonably well for a couple of reasons, a lot of your internal initiatives. Those drivers that were holding up margin, are those the same? Are you on a faster trajectory? Are you pivoting? Are you prioritizing some over the other? If you could share some of that, please? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Simeon, largely the same, roughly flat is what we've spoken to as it relates to gross margin over the course of the year. The puts and takes that we've talked through still relatively consistent. The headwinds from the supply chain expansion and investments in the Pro growth initiatives. The benefits and Bill covered this when he talked through merch productivity, higher private brands penetration, lower commodity transportation costs and then the pricing initiatives that we're working through. So those largely are going to drive the outputs. And then just from an SG&A standpoint, that's where we're going to see the bulk of the leverage, 40 to 60 basis points reflected in the new guide. That's going to offset the planned wage increases and the strategic investments. And then on the lower sales, just the change from the previous guide, it's mainly volume related. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. \nSteven Zaccone: I wanted to focus specifically on the second quarter guidance just since weather has been so volatile. Is there any more detail you can provide about how the business is trending thus far in May would be helpful. \nMarvin Ellison: Steve, this is Marvin. I'll take that. So Steve, we would basically describe it as in line with our current guidance. The good news is, is as we've seen periods of more sustained seasonal weather, we've seen those seasonal categories respond in line to that. And that's geographically specific around West, South, North and East. But May is performing basically at our current guidance. \nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Appreciate that color. Then Marvin, I'm curious for your perspective on the potential duration of this weakness we're seeing in discretionary spending. What's your take on how long this potentially could last? There's a lot of macro cost currents at play. So just curious for your opinion. \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. It's a really good question and really to be quite honest with you, as you can imagine, we spent a lot of time looking at it, but it's just hard to predict. What we can say is that the overall structural drivers for home improvement remain really strong. And so we are bullish to the medium and long-term health of this business, things like the savings rate of consumers and you're looking at pent-up demand in the housing shortage, the age of homes. I mean, all of these things are still incredibly relevant. And when you think about the highest correlating factors to our sales, historically, they remain disposable personal income, home price appreciation and the age of housing side. So although we can't predict the duration of what we think will be a more short-term turbulence, but we think the medium and long-term health of this segment is incredibly strong. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: So my first question, Marvin, just maybe a bit of a follow-up on the prior question. But just with respect to the commentary around discretionary, maybe can you give a little more color on what you're seeing? And how do you think about this weakness in discretionary relative to some of the weather disruptions. And then if you look here at Q1, is there anything really noticeably different than what we saw maybe in Q4 on the discretionary side? \nMarvin Ellison: So Brian, I'd give you some thoughts. I'll let Brandon jump in and provide any additional thoughts. But candidly, what we're seeing is pressure across big-ticket discretionary purchases primarily. We're seeing some pressure in small ticket, but it's more pronounced in big ticket and is almost exclusively discretionary in DIY. As you know, 75% of our business is penetrated in the DIY customer, and Q1 is our most discretionary quarter of the year because of all the seasonal purchases.\n So when we run into timing of unseasonal weather, it has a disproportionate impact on our business. So we've been trying to pull apart the difference between discretionary pullback in weather-related non-spending. And so as we look at the month of May, as an example, we can start to see more clarity that when the sun comes out and the weather gets a more normalized kind of performance, as you would expect, the business in those discretionary categories have picked up. So that's why Brandon noted that we have an expectation we're going to get roughly $250 million back from delayed spring. \n So for us, we're seeing discretionary big-ticket pullback primarily in DIY. The other good news for us is because our Pro-consumer and our target consumer is that small to medium-sized customer, that customer's backlog remains healthy and that customer spend has been relatively consistent. That's why we're able -- the positive comp in Pro for the quarter with over 800 basis points of lumber deflation specifically for that consumer.\n Brandon, I don't know if you have anything else. \nBrandon Sink: Brian, this is Brandon. I think just looking out a little bit beyond the weather that Marvin just spoke to, when we look at this topic of normalization, home improvement share of wallet, definitely seeing normalization back to services in terms of where discretionary purchases are going from consumers, travel, restaurants and a shift back to some necessity-based spend, groceries, gas, taking up a larger share of wallet given the inflation that we're seeing. But just as we look at the business at a broad level, units transactions well documented back in below, in some cases, to 2019 levels. But as Marvin mentioned, really nuances within that. \n We're seeing Pro categories, in particular, building materials, rough plumbing, lumber has been a great story with what we've been able to drive with units and then categories like appliances where we've continued to grow units and shares. So all that combined, we are very optimistic in the medium to longer term that the categories where we've seen reversion or normalization, we got a new baseline there to which -- to manage the business. And then in these other categories that are out running, we can continue -- confidence that we can continue to take share there. \nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And maybe a follow-up separately, interesting comments about your rural stores, your strategy there. Anything you could say to help us better size this opportunity? Where are those -- the volumes are those units now versus maybe the chain average of some of your larger volumes? And then as you think about this re-merchandising effort, I mean, how much could that add and over what time frame to store volumes there? \nMarvin Ellison: Brian, what I'll do and I'll let Bill give you just some specifics on some of the categories that we're adding. And again, we piloted this for over a year to get the mix right, to get the assortment right. And we came away extremely pleased with the pilot results and thus, we identified roughly 300 stores that we're expanding this too, but I'll let Bill give you some specifics on those categories and what we believe that we can get from them. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. And Brian, this is Bill. And so in my opening remarks, I mentioned some of these key categories in areas like pet. And we think there's an opportunity in these rural markets to do more in that category. There's opportunities with apparel. And so the launch of our -- the Carhartt brand, Wrangler brands gives us an opportunity to do something there in those markets. And then you think around livestock and really livestock feed as the consumer is looking for options from us to be able to serve that consumer. And then you can get into areas like fencing and some of these small pents that folks will use. And we're finding some interesting things with water troughs that are being used, certainly to water livestock, but they're also being used as a decorative piece for consumer's home where they're planting flowers in it.\n So just a lot of interesting stuff that we're starting to learn here that the customer has given us a lot of credit for and wants to see Lowe's carry in their community. And that was part of the early pilot in those few stores that has allowed us to accelerate to get it to 300. \nMarvin Ellison: And Brian, this is Marvin again. Just last point on that. Both Bill and I grew up in rural parts of the country. Bill in rural Montana, I grew up in rural Tennessee and I think rural Tennessee is actually more rural than rural Montana, but that's for another discussion. We're seeing things like ATVs, we pilot it, having no idea if customers will respond. And it's been an incredible growth category for us. And in these rural markets, they are responding really well.\n So a lot of learning, but what's also interesting is we are finding categories in these rural stores that we think will be relevant in nonrural locations, and that's been the beauty of this entire pilot and the strategy, and we'll continue to learn. But I'll just repeat what I said in my prepared comments, many of us, including me, and many in the marketplace perceive these rural and remote stores as a true competitive disadvantage to Lowe's, but we've now determined that, that is the opposite. We think that these stores give us incredible opportunities to not only grow top line with more improved sales per square foot but also just the operational profit opportunity with improved technology, improved omnichannel capabilities, improved efficiency. I mean, this is something that we're very excited about over the next, call it, 3 to 5 years. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. \nSeth Sigman: I wanted to just follow up on the May comment. I think you said it was consistent with guidance. I just want to clarify, does that mean consistent with the comment that Q2 would be at the upper end of the range. And then I think if you step back for a second, your original guidance had assumed some sequential improvement in the second quarter. Can you just remind us what some of the drivers of that were going to be. \nMarvin Ellison: So I'll take the first part on May. We tend not to give specific detail on current trends for all the obvious reasons. And so I'll leave my comments at May is performing at guidance, and we feel good about what we've seen, areas of sustained weather and how our seasonal categories are responding in those geographic locations, and that's reflective of May's performance.\n And with that, I'll let Brandon answer the second part of your question. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, sure, Seth. Just consistent with the upper end of guidance is what we referred to. And just the components again, the $250 million delayed spring benefit, the lumber deflation is going to step up. So a 350-basis point pressure in Q1, now expecting that to be 150 basis points in Q2. And just a reminder of the week shift benefit from Q1 is now flipping into Q2, and we expect that to be a $400 million drag. So those are just the components again, as it relates to Q2. \nSeth Sigman: Got you. Okay. And then just a follow-up question on average ticket and inflation. It sounds like you still have some of the wrapping of the price increases from last year. But I guess, in general, how are you thinking about pricing going forward? Is there an opportunity to maybe roll some prices back? And maybe if you could tie in commentary around the elasticity that you're seeing in lumber. And I realize that category is a little bit different, but your commentary around the unit volume increase that you saw seem to be quite strong. So maybe just tie those 2 together. \nBrandon Sink: Seth, I can take that as well. So when we look at the makeup in terms of ticket and transaction, as you mentioned, we're seeing the pace and cost increases. Those have slowed pretty dramatically here over the course of the last couple of quarters. We are still expecting a modest level of product inflation as we look out at '23. Most of that is wrapped from pricing actions that we've taken in the second half of last year. We are -- ex lumber average ticket is actually up in most categories when we look at Q1. The lumber deflationary pressure is expected to continue to impact average ticket in Q2, but not as significant as Q1. And then when we look outside of commodities, we're not anticipating any meaningful deflationary pressure as we move through the year.\n Mainly the pressure is going to be coming from what Marvin mentioned, the pullback in DIY discretionary which is going to put pressure on ticket and that's especially true in the larger ticket bucket. So all in, the makeup of the comp and the outlook assumes more pressure overall on transactions, and we expect the average ticket number to hold up. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Is there a view, just given that you do cater to the smaller and midsized Pro, just that you can hold up maybe a little bit better given the industry backdrop. And with regards to market share, it sounds like there were some wins there during the first quarter. Have your share assumptions changed at all based on that for the year? \nMarvin Ellison: Kate, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of Pro with Joe, and then we'll let Bill and Brandon provide some market share input. I would first say we're really pleased with our Pro strategy. We spent a lot of time in the last 4-plus years trying to refine this strategy but also being very disciplined on not trying to overreach beyond our capabilities. And that's why the small to medium Pro has been our target Pro customer, and we feel like we're gaining traction. Anytime you can face over 800-basis points of lumber deflation and comping up against a 22% growth last year and still deliver a positive comp, I think it sends a signal that we're making progress.\n I'll let Joe talk specifically about a couple of the key initiatives that we rolled out that's gaining the most traction and while we feel confident that we can continue to take market share in that segment. \nJoseph McFarland: Thanks, Kate, for the question. And as you look at the makeup of our Pro, it is on that smaller side. And as we rolled out our MVP Pro Rewards program, we're really seeing the Pros engage with us in our loyalty, our credit programs, of course, when they are engaged there, they spend 3x more than those not engaged. We've rolled out new CRM insights so we can better anticipate the Pro's needs. We can build those relationships. And with the loyalty program and the CRM system, they continue to improve as they mature. And so really excited about the unlock that is still ahead. Very pleased with the Pro LTR that we're seeing as a result. So we feel we're in a good place. \nMarvin Ellison: And Kate, before I hand it to Bill, I'll just add one additional thing. We did a recent survey in April of our Pro customers and then 75% of those customers came back and their backlogs were still healthy compared to Q4 and that gave us confidence that we still believe that we can grow market share and grow to extra market with this specific customer segment.\n So Bill, you can talk about market share. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. So when you look at market share, obviously, it's hard to measure home improvement share specifically, but we try to triangulate using data from mix, track line, other data, relevant market and broader market data. And then we look at our performance, obviously, in key categories like we've mentioned in our prepared remarks in areas like appliances where we've had unit growth feel like we're picking up share there in addition to the Pro growth that we've had and the continued acceleration with our online business, gaining traction with private brands, all of that and those elements kind of give us confidence that we're gaining some share here in these key categories. And when you see a positive growth in areas like paint, we also feel like we're gaining share in those areas as well. \nBrandon Sink: Bill, the only thing I would add is just really pleased with the execution of Total Home strategy. You talked about Pro, positive comp with an 800-basis point drag on top of 11 consecutive quarters double-digit growth, really pleased with the online performance at plus 6%. So clearly, as we look at share gains, both for relevant market and broader home improvement, confident in what we're seeing. And it gives us confidence when we look at the broader market and our ability to grow 100 to 200 basis points above the market and growing Pro 2x when we look at 2023 and beyond. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: First one was on the rural pilot, Marvin. You've talked about localization for a couple of years now. A lot of the commentary in the past has been removing lawn mowers in Brooklyn, patio sets in West Philadelphia, Dex Damon, Scottsdale, when we think about this initiative here, it feels like it's a bit more strategic, more poised to benefit the top line versus limiting markdowns from the prior localization efforts. So if we go a bit deeper, is the benefit going to manifest itself more in terms of new customer acquisition or greater wallet share from existing customers. Presumably, both but just trying to understand kind of maybe where it may be more weighted in those pilot stores? That's my first question. \nMarvin Ellison: Jonathan, it's a very good question. And I think it is a combination of both because in order to add these new categories, we're taking categories out. And the categories we're taking out are the ones that were most at risk of being marked down because of the lack of localization. We had a, what I describe as a peanut butter spread on our assortment planning because our tools was so inferior is almost impossible for the merchants to do any really specific localization. \n So now we've improved our assortment planning tools, we now have the ability to execute the localization strategy as part of our Total Home strategy. And because of that, we now know what categories to pull out of these rural stores that were not productive and now we're adding in new categories, which will give us the ability to take the customer who's shopping us and shopping of the retailers because of the lack of broadness of our assortment, and we're getting a larger share of wallet of that customer, and we're also attracting a new customer that's now coming in because we're selling items, i.e., pet that we didn't sell before that they are now coming to us as a destination. \n And so we think this is something that has lots of potential, not to mention as we also implement the technology with the retiring of this old legacy system and we can then put in self-checkout and we can put it in mobile devices and all the other technology advancements that Joe and Seemantini and team have developed is going to also drive increased productivity and profitability in these stores. So we think it's a really clear example of our strategy working and it all hinges on getting the localization right.\n And Bill, I don't know if you have anything to add. \nWilliam Boltz: Just going to add, Marvin, that the early read in the test stores would tell us that we're getting a new customer coming in categories like pet, like apparel. Those are 2 of the -- 2 categories that we had early read on that said we were drawing a new customer to the door. And so that's exciting to see. \nJonathan Matuszewski: That's really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on regional trends. Any trends you're seeing in markets where housing prices have cooled a little bit. I think they were down a bit in April. Any discernible trends in terms of where you're seeing pressure, specifically in markets with cooling home prices? \nMarvin Ellison: Jonathan, you can imagine, we're paying close attention to that and the short answer is no. I mean, we're not seeing any disproportionate sales impact in some of these markets, and we are tracking these markets very aggressively and paying very close attention to all. \nOperator: Just going to announce our final question, Kate, that's coming from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. \nSteven Forbes: I'll ask my 2 together just in the interest of time. The first one, guys, can you just expand on how the first quarter Pro comp compared to your internal expectations? Ex lumber deflation seems like a big highlight during the quarter. And I wanted to know if you sort of identified what drove the outperformance, whether it's simply wallet share or accelerated new Pro growth and then a quick follow-up is just around the progress against the OpEx productivity initiatives. Any quantification of where you are versus those OpEx productivity goals as of the first quarter and/or what the guidance implies for a year-end goal? \nMarvin Ellison: So Steven, I'll take the Pro question. I'll give Brandon the productivity question. The short answer is Pro did outperform our expectations. We -- candidly, we didn't anticipate 800 basis points of impact to lumber deflation for that specific customer. So the fact that we were able to deliver a positive comp, it actually exceeded our expectations. And I think it comes down to what you heard Joe mentioned earlier, and that is the maturity of our MVP Pro rewards program and our CRM tool, the increased Pro related national brands that Bill and his team have worked to get added to the assortment and our improved fulfillment capabilities that Don Frieson, the supply chain team in partnership with operations that really work to create a more seamless ability for Pros to get product and not to mention the improved digital capabilities that help to deliver a 6% online comp during the quarter as well. We take all of those things combined. And we believe that we'll continue to lean into those initiatives to drive continued market share gain. Brandon? \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Steven, I'll speak to PPI. So very much in line with our expectations there. I mentioned earlier, 40 to 60 basis points of EBIT expansion plan this year. We have a really aggressive portfolio, a road map of initiatives across the business, across every function set to drive operational efficiencies. We've mentioned a few of those today. Store tech modernization, front-end transformation to name a few. So really aggressive plans, and we're very much seeing those come to fruition in line with how we've guided. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at our Annual Shareholders Meeting this Friday and on our second quarter earnings call in August. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Lowe's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brandon Sink",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Beginning with our Q1 results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.77 compared to $3.51 last year. Now my comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons where applicable. Non-GAAP measures have been adjusted to exclude the gain associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business.\n In the quarter, we recognized a net pretax gain of $63 million on deferred consideration associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business. Excluding this benefit, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.67, an increase of 5% compared to prior year. Q1 sales were $22.3 billion, which includes approximately $735 million related to a shift in our fiscal calendar as we cycle over a 53-week year. Also, as a reminder, prior year sales included $1.2 billion generated in our Canadian retail business.\n As Marvin mentioned, comparable sales were down 4.3%, partly driven by a later start to spring and a more cautious consumer. This also includes approximately 350 basis points of lumber deflation. Please note that comparable sales are calculated based on weeks 2 through 14 in fiscal 2022. Comparable average ticket was down 0.3%, largely driven by lumber deflation as ticket increased in the majority of our other merchandise divisions. Comp transactions declined 4% due to the delayed start of spring and lower-than-expected DIY discretionary sales. Our monthly comps were down 3% in February. With unfavorable weather patterns across the country in March and April, comps declined 5.4% and 3.9%, respectively.\n Lower sales in seasonal categories pressured sales by approximately $400 million in the quarter, or approximately 175 basis points. Gross margin was 33.7% of sales in the first quarter, down 35 basis points from last year. Gross margin benefited from a favorable product mix, offset by costs associated with the expansion of our supply chain network.  There was no meaningful impact from shrink or credit revenue in the quarter. Also keep in mind that product margin in the prior year quarter reflected a timing benefit driven by product cost inflation. Adjusted SG&A of 17.4% of sales levered 79 basis points. As Marvin mentioned, this performance reflects an enterprise-wide disciplined focus on PPI that helped offset pressure from lower sales and wage investments. It also includes the benefit of a onetime legal settlement.\n Adjusted operating margin rate of 14.4% of sales levered 47 basis points. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.6% in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $19.5 billion, down $0.7 billion compared to Q1 of last year. As a reminder, prior year inventory levels includes our Canadian retail business. U.S. inventory units finished the quarter slightly down to last year.\n Now turning to our 2023 financial outlook. Given the higher-than-expected pullback we've seen in home improvement spending, we are now expecting our relevant market, which reflects our 75% DIY, 25% Pro mix to be down mid-single digits this year. But while we are seeing lower-than-expected DIY discretionary demand, we are also driving better-than-expected results in Pro and continued strength in our online sales and core categories like appliances and paint. This reinforces our confidence that we will continue to take market share and outperform the broader market.\n We are now expecting 2023 sales of $87 million to $89 billion with comparable sales expected to range from down 2% to down 4%. Please note that the updated outlook also reflects the impact of lower-than-expected lumber prices. This creates an incremental 50 basis points of pressure on full year sales as compared to our original expectations. We continue to expect Pro to outpace DIY for the year as Pro backlogs are healthy, and demand for Pro services remain strong. We now expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 13.4% to 13.6% for the full year driven by PPI initiatives across the company, partly offset by planned wage investments and lower sales volumes. We expect capital expenditures of up to $2 billion this year and with our planned share repurchases, we expect to reach our 2.75x leverage target by the end of the year while maintaining our BBB+ credit rating.\n Finally, we are also updating our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in a range of $13.20 to $13.60. Keep in mind that our outlook for operating margin and diluted earnings per share are now adjusted to exclude the gain associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business that we recorded in the first quarter.\n To assist you with your modeling, I would like to spend a moment discussing our expectations for the second quarter. We are expecting an approximately $400 million headwind to sales due to the timing shift in our fiscal calendar. We also expect lumber deflation to pressure Q2 sales by approximately 150 basis points. Finally, we expect $250 million benefit to sales from the delayed spring. Taking all of this into account, we are expecting Q2 sales towards the higher end of our full year guide. We are also expecting adjusted operating margins slightly above prior year results, partly due to the impact of the shift in our fiscal calendar as well as the timing of several productivity initiatives that are already in flight.\n Turning to our capital allocation strategy. During the quarter, the company generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased 10.6 million shares for $2.1 billion and paid $633 million in dividends at $1.05 per share, returning $2.8 billion to our shareholders. Capital expenditures totaled $380 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We ended Q1 with $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents which includes proceeds from our $3 billion notes offering in March. We ended Q1 at 2.62x adjusted debt to EBITDA. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of 28%, inclusive of a 725-basis point impact related to transaction costs associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business and the discrete gain in Q1.\n In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute our Total Home strategy while navigating near-term market uncertainty. And we remain committed to our best-in-class capital allocation strategy centered around delivering sustainable shareholder value.\n And with that, we will open it up for questions. Liz, this is Brandon. Just as we think about the CapEx, as Marvin mentioned, we're not necessarily looking at opening stores over the long term is really part of our core strategy, but we love what we're seeing with these rural stores. We initially piloted on a smaller subset of locations. We love the profit profile of these stores within these rural markets, and we've been very thoughtful around the assortments and where we're rolling out and really excited to see this scale as we move through 2023 and what this can deliver from a top line perspective beyond that. Simeon, thanks for the question. This is Brandon. Let me just kind of speak a little bit to the curve specifically. When we look at Q2 as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, expecting Q2 sales towards the higher end of the full year guide. That's inclusive of the $250 million delayed spring benefit, offset by the 150 basis points lumber deflation and then the $400 million, week shift drag. As we start to transition and look at the second half, we do expect the Pro business is going to continue to outperform and drive our growth. We mentioned that backlogs remained healthy and we expect that business to continue to outpace DIY. \n The lumber inflation is -- or deflation is going to moderate as we start to look at second half and we cycle over more normal pricing over the balance of the year and then continued strength in what we're seeing with the online business and in core DIY businesses like appliances and paint. So taking all that into account when we look at the second half, we're looking at that in line with the full year guide. Yes. Simeon, largely the same, roughly flat is what we've spoken to as it relates to gross margin over the course of the year. The puts and takes that we've talked through still relatively consistent. The headwinds from the supply chain expansion and investments in the Pro growth initiatives. The benefits and Bill covered this when he talked through merch productivity, higher private brands penetration, lower commodity transportation costs and then the pricing initiatives that we're working through. So those largely are going to drive the outputs. And then just from an SG&A standpoint, that's where we're going to see the bulk of the leverage, 40 to 60 basis points reflected in the new guide. That's going to offset the planned wage increases and the strategic investments. And then on the lower sales, just the change from the previous guide, it's mainly volume related. Brian, this is Brandon. I think just looking out a little bit beyond the weather that Marvin just spoke to, when we look at this topic of normalization, home improvement share of wallet, definitely seeing normalization back to services in terms of where discretionary purchases are going from consumers, travel, restaurants and a shift back to some necessity-based spend, groceries, gas, taking up a larger share of wallet given the inflation that we're seeing. But just as we look at the business at a broad level, units transactions well documented back in below, in some cases, to 2019 levels. But as Marvin mentioned, really nuances within that. \n We're seeing Pro categories, in particular, building materials, rough plumbing, lumber has been a great story with what we've been able to drive with units and then categories like appliances where we've continued to grow units and shares. So all that combined, we are very optimistic in the medium to longer term that the categories where we've seen reversion or normalization, we got a new baseline there to which -- to manage the business. And then in these other categories that are out running, we can continue -- confidence that we can continue to take share there. Yes, sure, Seth. Just consistent with the upper end of guidance is what we referred to. And just the components again, the $250 million delayed spring benefit, the lumber deflation is going to step up. So a 350-basis point pressure in Q1, now expecting that to be 150 basis points in Q2. And just a reminder of the week shift benefit from Q1 is now flipping into Q2, and we expect that to be a $400 million drag. So those are just the components again, as it relates to Q2. Seth, I can take that as well. So when we look at the makeup in terms of ticket and transaction, as you mentioned, we're seeing the pace and cost increases. Those have slowed pretty dramatically here over the course of the last couple of quarters. We are still expecting a modest level of product inflation as we look out at '23. Most of that is wrapped from pricing actions that we've taken in the second half of last year. We are -- ex lumber average ticket is actually up in most categories when we look at Q1. The lumber deflationary pressure is expected to continue to impact average ticket in Q2, but not as significant as Q1. And then when we look outside of commodities, we're not anticipating any meaningful deflationary pressure as we move through the year.\n Mainly the pressure is going to be coming from what Marvin mentioned, the pullback in DIY discretionary which is going to put pressure on ticket and that's especially true in the larger ticket bucket. So all in, the makeup of the comp and the outlook assumes more pressure overall on transactions, and we expect the average ticket number to hold up. Bill, the only thing I would add is just really pleased with the execution of Total Home strategy. You talked about Pro, positive comp with an 800-basis point drag on top of 11 consecutive quarters double-digit growth, really pleased with the online performance at plus 6%. So clearly, as we look at share gains, both for relevant market and broader home improvement, confident in what we're seeing. And it gives us confidence when we look at the broader market and our ability to grow 100 to 200 basis points above the market and growing Pro 2x when we look at 2023 and beyond. Yes, Steven, I'll speak to PPI. So very much in line with our expectations there. I mentioned earlier, 40 to 60 basis points of EBIT expansion plan this year. We have a really aggressive portfolio, a road map of initiatives across the business, across every function set to drive operational efficiencies. We've mentioned a few of those today. Store tech modernization, front-end transformation to name a few. So really aggressive plans, and we're very much seeing those come to fruition in line with how we've guided."

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our comparable sales declined 4.3%, driven by approximately 350 basis points of lumber deflation, unfavorable weather and lower DIY discretionary sales. We continue to build momentum with the Pro through our MVPs Pro Rewards program and our expanded assortment of Pro national brands.  Lumber deflation disproportionately impacted Pro sales by approximately 800 basis points of comp pressure and despite this pressure, comparable Pro sales were slightly positive in Q1 with broad-based strength across multiple categories. This positive comp in Pro builds on top of a 22% U.S. Pro comp in the first quarter of last year.  \n DIY sales were pressured by delayed spring and lower-than-expected discretionary demand, although we are encouraged to see better trends in periods of favorable weather. A late start to spring disproportionately impacts do-it-yourself customers who represent 75% of our business, given many seasonal categories are heavily concentrated in DIY. As weather improves, we're optimistic that customers will reengage with spring projects, and we are ready to support the increased demand with our best in-stock position and staffing levels in 3 years, coupled with improved omnichannel and fulfillment capabilities. However, we are expecting a pullback in discretionary consumer spending over the near term. Given these trends, we're updating our full year outlook this morning.\n Despite market pressures, we are pleased to see market share gains this quarter, and we expect to continue to outpace the market as we execute against the growth initiatives of our Total Home strategy. We're also confident in our ability to drive continued productivity through our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. This operational discipline and agility helped us to offset the impact of lower sales and higher wage costs in Q1.\n Adjusted operating margin expanded 47 basis points in the first quarter, leading to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.67, a 5% increase compared to last year. While we can't control commodity deflation, weather or macroeconomic uncertainty, we can control how effectively we operate our business and adapt to a changing environment.\n A key component of our transformation that is often overload is the culture of continuous improvement we've introduced at Lowe's, which is the foundation of our perpetual productivity improvement initiatives. And although our PPI initiatives originated operations, we're now focused on driving productivity across all areas of the company. And we see tremendous runway ahead for continued productivity across the business including dozens of PPI work streams in merchandising, store operations, supply chain and corporate support functions.\n As an example, we're replacing our 30-year-old operating system with a modern omnichannel architecture that will enable a seamless, intuitive customer experience while removing complexity for associates. This project has been underway for 4 years, and we are pleased that we are on track to retire all legacy green screens by the end of this year. This new modern operating system will allow us to unlock a significant amount of labor productivity and deploy new capabilities including enabling more seamless omnichannel selling for within our stores.\n In addition to our new operating system, our penetration of rural stores gives us an opportunity to drive sustainable profit growth due to the much lower expense base that's required to operate these stores. As an example, what we spend to operate our store in Philadelphia, Mississippi is significantly less than the cost to operate one of our stores in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While in years past, our penetration of rural and remote stores was viewed as a competitive disadvantage, we now expect that these stores will be a key component of our operating profit growth over the next 3 to 5 years. Given our confidence in this trajectory, we set long-term targets of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in incremental productivity gains at our December Analyst and Investor Conference and we are tracking our progress against those initiatives on a monthly, if not, a weekly basis.\n In addition to our disciplined focus on productivity, this quarter, we also continued to make strides with our Total Home strategy. And in Pro, our growth was fueled by continued acceleration of our MVPs Pro Rewards Program and CRM tool, coupled with our improved Pro assortment, inventory depth and omnichannel capabilities. These initiatives have enabled us to continue to gain traction with our core Pro customer, which is a small to medium-sized Pro. Joe will discuss some of the exciting new Pro initiatives later in the call.  \n Our online sales also accelerated this quarter with 6% comparable sales growth, representing more than a 10% sales penetration. Online growth was supported by an increase in Pro sales as we continue to upgrade our Pro digital experience with new tools and personalization. We also continue to enhance our DIY online experience by making home improvement projects easier for consumers to visualize, estimate and shop. And these investments are paying off with higher online conversions and attachment rates.  \n In supply chain, we continue to roll out our market delivery model, bringing us to 12 geographic regions across the country, supporting more than 1,100 stores. And we're pleased that this more efficient model of delivering big and bulky products is already enabling us to accelerate our market share gains and appliances and will enable future growth in other big and bulky product categories. And we remain on schedule to have market delivery rolled out by the end of 2023.  \n And despite a macroeconomic environment with mixed signals creating near-term pressures, we remain optimistic about the future of home improvement. And once we navigate through this uncertainty, we remain bullish on the long-term outlook for our industry due to the unique convergence of structural drivers and demographic trends that are supportive of home improvement demand. And we feel fortunate to operate in such a favorable sector of retail, where 2/3 of our sales remain nondiscretionary. And as we navigate this near-term pressure, we will continue to monitor trends closely and we are confident that we have the agility needed to quickly adapt to any scenario.\n In closing, I'd like to thank our frontline associates for their continued hard work and dedication to supporting our customers and our communities.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Liz, this is Marvin. I think it's more in tune with what Bill talked about with some of the investments we're making in those rural stores. As we survey those customers, they give us a list of things they wish they could purchase in one shopping occasion and some of those types of things like Carhartt Apparel, farm and ranch types of items and categories as part of our expansion opportunity. And we think by doing those types of initiatives, we're going to see sales per square foot actually improve. \n As a matter of fact, when we look at the pilot stores where we've been very diligent on going after those specific categories, we actually saw that within the pilot locations. And so that is leading us into this roughly 300 store expansion of these extended categories. And we just see this as a unique opportunity. I mentioned that the expense base is lower. But as you said, if you can have a lower expense base, then you can improve sales per square footage, that in a combination of all the other initiatives we're doing around the company, we think will continue to drive our profit growth. And I'll let Brandon add any additional comments. Liz, it's about the same, but I mentioned in my prepared comments that we're retiring this old legacy operating system and by retiring this system, it opens up the ability to have really true omnichannel selling in the store. So we see omnichannel and e-commerce growth only accelerating with the ability of our 300-plus thousand associates having the ability to more easily transact in the store, thus connecting physical and digital in a more seamless way. Yes, we can, Simeon. Steve, this is Marvin. I'll take that. So Steve, we would basically describe it as in line with our current guidance. The good news is, is as we've seen periods of more sustained seasonal weather, we've seen those seasonal categories respond in line to that. And that's geographically specific around West, South, North and East. But May is performing basically at our current guidance. Yes. It's a really good question and really to be quite honest with you, as you can imagine, we spent a lot of time looking at it, but it's just hard to predict. What we can say is that the overall structural drivers for home improvement remain really strong. And so we are bullish to the medium and long-term health of this business, things like the savings rate of consumers and you're looking at pent-up demand in the housing shortage, the age of homes. I mean, all of these things are still incredibly relevant. And when you think about the highest correlating factors to our sales, historically, they remain disposable personal income, home price appreciation and the age of housing side. So although we can't predict the duration of what we think will be a more short-term turbulence, but we think the medium and long-term health of this segment is incredibly strong. So Brian, I'd give you some thoughts. I'll let Brandon jump in and provide any additional thoughts. But candidly, what we're seeing is pressure across big-ticket discretionary purchases primarily. We're seeing some pressure in small ticket, but it's more pronounced in big ticket and is almost exclusively discretionary in DIY. As you know, 75% of our business is penetrated in the DIY customer, and Q1 is our most discretionary quarter of the year because of all the seasonal purchases.\n So when we run into timing of unseasonal weather, it has a disproportionate impact on our business. So we've been trying to pull apart the difference between discretionary pullback in weather-related non-spending. And so as we look at the month of May, as an example, we can start to see more clarity that when the sun comes out and the weather gets a more normalized kind of performance, as you would expect, the business in those discretionary categories have picked up. So that's why Brandon noted that we have an expectation we're going to get roughly $250 million back from delayed spring. \n So for us, we're seeing discretionary big-ticket pullback primarily in DIY. The other good news for us is because our Pro-consumer and our target consumer is that small to medium-sized customer, that customer's backlog remains healthy and that customer spend has been relatively consistent. That's why we're able -- the positive comp in Pro for the quarter with over 800 basis points of lumber deflation specifically for that consumer.\n Brandon, I don't know if you have anything else. Brian, what I'll do and I'll let Bill give you just some specifics on some of the categories that we're adding. And again, we piloted this for over a year to get the mix right, to get the assortment right. And we came away extremely pleased with the pilot results and thus, we identified roughly 300 stores that we're expanding this too, but I'll let Bill give you some specifics on those categories and what we believe that we can get from them. And Brian, this is Marvin again. Just last point on that. Both Bill and I grew up in rural parts of the country. Bill in rural Montana, I grew up in rural Tennessee and I think rural Tennessee is actually more rural than rural Montana, but that's for another discussion. We're seeing things like ATVs, we pilot it, having no idea if customers will respond. And it's been an incredible growth category for us. And in these rural markets, they are responding really well.\n So a lot of learning, but what's also interesting is we are finding categories in these rural stores that we think will be relevant in nonrural locations, and that's been the beauty of this entire pilot and the strategy, and we'll continue to learn. But I'll just repeat what I said in my prepared comments, many of us, including me, and many in the marketplace perceive these rural and remote stores as a true competitive disadvantage to Lowe's, but we've now determined that, that is the opposite. We think that these stores give us incredible opportunities to not only grow top line with more improved sales per square foot but also just the operational profit opportunity with improved technology, improved omnichannel capabilities, improved efficiency. I mean, this is something that we're very excited about over the next, call it, 3 to 5 years. So I'll take the first part on May. We tend not to give specific detail on current trends for all the obvious reasons. And so I'll leave my comments at May is performing at guidance, and we feel good about what we've seen, areas of sustained weather and how our seasonal categories are responding in those geographic locations, and that's reflective of May's performance.\n And with that, I'll let Brandon answer the second part of your question. Kate, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of Pro with Joe, and then we'll let Bill and Brandon provide some market share input. I would first say we're really pleased with our Pro strategy. We spent a lot of time in the last 4-plus years trying to refine this strategy but also being very disciplined on not trying to overreach beyond our capabilities. And that's why the small to medium Pro has been our target Pro customer, and we feel like we're gaining traction. Anytime you can face over 800-basis points of lumber deflation and comping up against a 22% growth last year and still deliver a positive comp, I think it sends a signal that we're making progress.\n I'll let Joe talk specifically about a couple of the key initiatives that we rolled out that's gaining the most traction and while we feel confident that we can continue to take market share in that segment. And Kate, before I hand it to Bill, I'll just add one additional thing. We did a recent survey in April of our Pro customers and then 75% of those customers came back and their backlogs were still healthy compared to Q4 and that gave us confidence that we still believe that we can grow market share and grow to extra market with this specific customer segment.\n So Bill, you can talk about market share. Jonathan, it's a very good question. And I think it is a combination of both because in order to add these new categories, we're taking categories out. And the categories we're taking out are the ones that were most at risk of being marked down because of the lack of localization. We had a, what I describe as a peanut butter spread on our assortment planning because our tools was so inferior is almost impossible for the merchants to do any really specific localization. \n So now we've improved our assortment planning tools, we now have the ability to execute the localization strategy as part of our Total Home strategy. And because of that, we now know what categories to pull out of these rural stores that were not productive and now we're adding in new categories, which will give us the ability to take the customer who's shopping us and shopping of the retailers because of the lack of broadness of our assortment, and we're getting a larger share of wallet of that customer, and we're also attracting a new customer that's now coming in because we're selling items, i.e., pet that we didn't sell before that they are now coming to us as a destination. \n And so we think this is something that has lots of potential, not to mention as we also implement the technology with the retiring of this old legacy system and we can then put in self-checkout and we can put it in mobile devices and all the other technology advancements that Joe and Seemantini and team have developed is going to also drive increased productivity and profitability in these stores. So we think it's a really clear example of our strategy working and it all hinges on getting the localization right.\n And Bill, I don't know if you have anything to add. Jonathan, you can imagine, we're paying close attention to that and the short answer is no. I mean, we're not seeing any disproportionate sales impact in some of these markets, and we are tracking these markets very aggressively and paying very close attention to all. So Steven, I'll take the Pro question. I'll give Brandon the productivity question. The short answer is Pro did outperform our expectations. We -- candidly, we didn't anticipate 800 basis points of impact to lumber deflation for that specific customer. So the fact that we were able to deliver a positive comp, it actually exceeded our expectations. And I think it comes down to what you heard Joe mentioned earlier, and that is the maturity of our MVP Pro rewards program and our CRM tool, the increased Pro related national brands that Bill and his team have worked to get added to the assortment and our improved fulfillment capabilities that Don Frieson, the supply chain team in partnership with operations that really work to create a more seamless ability for Pros to get product and not to mention the improved digital capabilities that help to deliver a 6% online comp during the quarter as well. We take all of those things combined. And we believe that we'll continue to lean into those initiatives to drive continued market share gain. Brandon?"

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, 5 of our 14 merchandising categories were positive, building materials, rough plumbing, paint, hardware and appliances. We continue to see broad-based Pro strength across all 3 merchandising divisions. In home decor, paint and appliances delivered the strongest comps this quarter. Our momentum in appliances continues to build as we drove higher unit sales and work to continue to take market share by leveraging our improved omnichannel shopping experience, enhanced market delivery capabilities and expanded assortment.\n Appliances are a great example of an omnichannel category, where customers often compare options online, then visit our showroom to see products in-person and then get their questions answered by one of our appliance specialists. And with our improved online capabilities like easy scheduling and order tracking, we continue to see more and more of our customers getting comfortable completing their purchases online. In the U.S., we estimate that roughly 100,000 appliances break every day. So our investments in fast appliance delivery and a seamless omnichannel shopping experience, positions us well as the go-to destination for these urgent and often nondiscretionary needs.\n We are also seeing increased demand in paint, especially from our Pros who paint as they take advantage of our paint job site delivery, our MVPs Paint Rewards Program and our improved product assortment. This quarter, we took the next step in catering to these important customers by launching Spec Right interior paint in partnership with Sherwin-Williams. This is our first exclusive line of tintable paint formulated specifically for Pros.\n Within decor, we recently launched new closet organization solutions across 4 private brands to meet a range of storage needs and budgets. This includes modular, easy-to-install wood or wire closet systems that are modern, customizable and a far better value than the competition. Our private brand strategy allows us to deliver value to DIY customers who are looking for high-quality, on-trend products at more affordable price points which enables us to provide differentiation, loyalty and profitability.\n Turning to building products. Building materials and rough plumbing led the way. In building materials, we saw broad-based strength, reflecting the investments we made to improve our Pro offering through an enhanced assortment. You may remember, last year, when we announced a new 10-foot fiberglass rebar known as PINKBAR by Owens Corning. This product exceeded our sales expectation given its strength, lightweight materials and corrosion resistance. This year, we're building on that success with the new 20-foot PINKBAR product, designed to help Pros reinforce bigger structures using fewer connections, ultimately saving them time and money on material costs.\n Rough plumbing was driven by strength in water heaters, HVAC, plumbing repair and pipe and fittings. As we continue to strengthen our offering for the Pro and the DIY consumer in these categories. And while lumber comps were pressured by steep year-over-year lumber deflation, the category had the highest unit comp in the company this quarter, reflecting strong Pro demand. We are pleased with our continued enhancements to our strong assortment of Pro products from trusted brands like Bosch, DEWALT, Eaton, Estwing, FastenMaster, FLEX, GRK, Hubbell, ITW, Klein Tools, LESCO, Little Giant, Lufkin, Mansfield, Marshalltown, Matabo, SharkBite, Simpson Strong-Tie, SPAX, Spyder and Werner.\n In hardlines, our performance was pressured by the delayed spring, some volatile weather in the West and softer discretionary spending. However, we did see higher demand during periods where weather improved. In lawn and garden, we proactively partnered with our live goods vendors to increase our agility in responding to changing weather patterns, which was critical in a season marked by erratic weather. Our live good vendors play a key role each spring as we continue to refine our local offerings in addition to the timing of when product arrives to our stores.\n This year, they help support our new Green Vest program, where our merchandising service team or MST associates, along with support from our vendors, now provides service to our garden centers, taking the tasks off the shoulders of our Red Vest associates to allow them to focus on serving the customer. We also continue to expand our private brand offering including a full lineup of new and innovative lawn fertilizers and grass seed products through our Sta-Green brand, which is already exceeding our expectations.\n And in hardware, in addition to delivering a positive comp, we also saw strong attachment rates alongside the higher lumber unit sales and strength in building materials, powered by the improved assortments of the key fastening brands like SPAX, GRK, FastenMaster, ITW and Power Pro One. As we continue to enhance our assortments at a national level, we also continue to advance our localization work. This is a key pillar of our Total Home strategy with the goal of expanding market share, increasing inventory productivity and protecting our margins. We have been piloting a localized framework for a few common market categories like rural and urban stores. Today, I'm excited to announce we are now scaling our rural framework to as many as 300 additional stores by year-end, with a wider offering of farm, ranch and outdoor products that positions Lowe's as a one-stop shop to make it convenient for rural customers to get what they need in one shopping trip.\n Our rural format includes broader product offerings in categories such as pet, livestock, trailers, fencing, utility vehicles, specialized hardware and our new Carhartt Apparel, all designed to meet the unique needs and preferences of rural homeowners who work and play outdoors.  Given our rural store footprint, and long-standing relationships in these communities, we see this as a natural opportunity for our business and one that will simplify the shopping experience for these very valuable customers. And as Marvin mentioned, we see the productivity improvements in these stores as a key component to delivering sustainable growth in our operating profit.\n We also remain focused on our many merchandising PPI initiatives, including leveraging our modernized cost optimization tools to negotiate costs with vendors and we're getting more strategic and surgical in our inventory planning to focus on more high-velocity core inventory items with low markdown risk like Pro replenishment and fewer slow velocity SKUs.\n From a technology standpoint, in the first quarter, we completed the rollout of new dedicated Zebra smartphones for all MST associates ahead of schedule. These devices are equipped with the new MST app designed to optimize their time with technology that leapfrogs the competition. The system automatically prioritize planogram changes, pricing updates, base service and other projects to optimize associates' time on the most efficient, highest value next task. And it also gives associates step-by-step instructions to maximize productivity and minimize the learning curve for new associates. This app was built internally to seamlessly integrate with our other mobile apps.\n For example, each time an MST associate resets a bay, the product location automatically updates in our associate product app and our customer mobile app. So both associates and customers can quickly find what they're looking for. As I close, I'd like to again extend my appreciation to our vendors and our merchants for their partnership, hard work, innovation and continued support.\n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Yes. And Brian, this is Bill. And so in my opening remarks, I mentioned some of these key categories in areas like pet. And we think there's an opportunity in these rural markets to do more in that category. There's opportunities with apparel. And so the launch of our -- the Carhartt brand, Wrangler brands gives us an opportunity to do something there in those markets. And then you think around livestock and really livestock feed as the consumer is looking for options from us to be able to serve that consumer. And then you can get into areas like fencing and some of these small pents that folks will use. And we're finding some interesting things with water troughs that are being used, certainly to water livestock, but they're also being used as a decorative piece for consumer's home where they're planting flowers in it.\n So just a lot of interesting stuff that we're starting to learn here that the customer has given us a lot of credit for and wants to see Lowe's carry in their community. And that was part of the early pilot in those few stores that has allowed us to accelerate to get it to 300. Yes. So when you look at market share, obviously, it's hard to measure home improvement share specifically, but we try to triangulate using data from mix, track line, other data, relevant market and broader market data. And then we look at our performance, obviously, in key categories like we've mentioned in our prepared remarks in areas like appliances where we've had unit growth feel like we're picking up share there in addition to the Pro growth that we've had and the continued acceleration with our online business, gaining traction with private brands, all of that and those elements kind of give us confidence that we're gaining some share here in these key categories. And when you see a positive growth in areas like paint, we also feel like we're gaining share in those areas as well. Just going to add, Marvin, that the early read in the test stores would tell us that we're getting a new customer coming in categories like pet, like apparel. Those are 2 of the -- 2 categories that we had early read on that said we were drawing a new customer to the door. And so that's exciting to see."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. At Lowe's, we are committed to being the employer of choice in retail for associates to choose to build their careers. As a reflection of this commitment over the last 3 years, we have increased the hourly rate for our store associates by 20%. And since 2018, we have invested over $3 billion in incremental wage and share-based compensation for our frontline associates. As a result of our consistent and ongoing commitment to our hourly associates, we are seeing our best staffing levels in 3 years, improved retention and the highest customer satisfaction scores in our company's history.\n In addition to compensation, we are also taking other steps to show appreciation to our associates, including simple initiatives like lowering the prices of the food in our store break rooms and closing our stores on Easter for the fourth consecutive year. These expressions of appreciation may not sound overly complex, but to our hourly associates, they matter.  As a former hourly associate, one way I measure improved associate engagement is by tracking the number of people who transition their jobs into careers. More than 85% of leadership roles are now filled from within up nearly 700 basis points over the last 2 years.\n Our frontline associates deserve all the credit for the transformation of our company, and I would like to personally thank all of our associates for everything they do to support each other, our customers and our communities.\n Now let me transition to Pro, one of the highlights in the first quarter. I'm excited to announce that we've just launched new Pro online business tools, the latest enhancement to our MVPs Pro Rewards program, which is designed to make Pros of all sizes feel like MVPs at Lowe's. Through our surveys, we learned Pros would welcome time-saving tools that help them shop quickly and minimize time away from the job site. At the same time, we learned our Pro associates spend a lot of time building quotes and checking order status, tasked to take them away from serving customers in their stores.\n To solve for both needs, we launched a suite of tools on lowes.com and our mobile app that make it easy for Pros to manage their orders from anywhere, whether that's on-the-job site, at home or out of town. Rather than having to drive to our stores to get a quote, Pros can now build and update online quotes in minutes. It automatically applies to their volume savings pricing and discounts and lets them quickly download a PDF quote for their customers. They can also use order tracking to track the status of the order throughout the fulfillment process.\n Pros tell us they love how easy and simple these tools are. In one Pro's words, he appreciates the convenience of being able to get a price, get it ordered and get it done. While these tools just launched in April, we are already seeing better-than-expected adoption rate and sales growth and expect results to accelerate as more Pros discover the new features. Our traction with Pros online is just one example of the momentum we are seeing in our MVPs Pro Rewards Program and one of the reasons we delivered a positive sales comp in Pro for Q1.\n Pros enrolled in our loyalty program continue to shop more frequently and buy more per trip and spend more overall. As our CRM tool matures, we are using data insights to identify trends that can improve our marketing and sales strategy, including tailoring our offerings by trade and by tier. These improved Pro capabilities and offerings are reflected in our Pro customer satisfaction scores, which are up 200 basis points over last year. In our April survey, over 75% of Pros continue to say their backlogs are healthy. While the Pro backlogs remain consistent with recent quarters, Pros did report a shift to smaller project sizes.\n Moving on to productivity. We continue to scale a series of perpetual productivity improvement initiatives or PPI. First, we remain laser-focused on technology modernization across all areas of our stores including rapidly replacing legacy self-checkout systems with our proprietary self-checkout registers. We are encouraged to see higher customer adoption, throughput, labor productivity and customer satisfaction on these registers and will complete all remaining stores later this year.\n We've also matured our new store inventory management system, or SIMS, which continues to improve our inventory visibility and operational efficiency. It also fully integrates with the mobile apps Bill just mentioned, reducing the time both associates and customers spend searching for product. We also continue to enhance our pick up in store experience to streamline processes and enhanced technology. These improvements drove faster fulfillment and a 400-basis point increase in pickup in store customer satisfaction scores in the first quarter.\n As we approach Memorial Day, I'd like to thank any veterans listening in for their service. As a marine who served combat tours in the Gulf War and Desert Storm, I'm proud of Lowe's long-standing history of giving back to our military community including a 10% military discount. And we are proud to support these customers who have given so much to our country.\n As I close, I would like to thank all our store leaders and associates once again for their hard work to serve customers, drive results and improve this business each and every day.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon. Thanks, Kate, for the question. And as you look at the makeup of our Pro, it is on that smaller side. And as we rolled out our MVP Pro Rewards program, we're really seeing the Pros engage with us in our loyalty, our credit programs, of course, when they are engaged there, they spend 3x more than those not engaged. We've rolled out new CRM insights so we can better anticipate the Pro's needs. We can build those relationships. And with the loyalty program and the CRM system, they continue to improve as they mature. And so really excited about the unlock that is still ahead. Very pleased with the Pro LTR that we're seeing as a result. So we feel we're in a good place."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2024. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before discussing our third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to offer my sympathy to the Marcus family on the passing of Bernie Marcus. Bernie and his partners Arthur Blank, Ken Langone and Pat Farrah invented the modern home improvement business model. And many years ago, Bernie took me under his wing to teach me the home improvement business. As a young executive eager to learn about merchandising, marketing and business strategy for one of the icons of the industry, I was surprised that during my first meeting, the only thing that Bernie talked about was the importance of people, both customers and associates. Bernie provided me with a lot of coaching, wisdom and advice during my early years in home improvement. He was a true original in every sense of the word. And because of his generosity and philanthropy, he leaves a legacy far beyond the home improvement industry. From me personally and from all of us at Lowe's, our thoughts and our prayers go out to his family and to his loved ones. Now allow me to transition to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were $20.2 billion and comparable sales were down 1.1%. Our results were modestly better than expected, even excluding storm-related activity driven by strong Pro and online sales and smaller ticket outdoor DIY projects. While demand for DIY discretionary bigger ticket projects remain soft, we're tightly managing our operating expenses and continuing to invest in our Total Home strategy. We're particularly pleased with the sustained strength we're delivering in two key areas: Pro and online sales. Our Pro sales were up again in Q3 with high single-digit positive comps. This growth is being driven by the investments we've made to better serve the small- to medium-sized Pro, which is our core Pro customer. Our efforts to transform the Pro shopping experience continue to pay dividends. We have the inventory depth and the brands that are the most important to these customers, and we're making it easy for them to shop in our stores and online, and through our Pro loyalty program, we're giving them reasons to keep coming back. Later in the call, Joe will provide more detail on our efforts to continue our momentum in Pro. We also continue to grow our online sales with 6% comparable sales growth. We've increased both online conversion and traffic, including a double-digit increase in traffic on our Lowe's mobile app. And we're making it easier and more convenient for customers to order paint and paint supplies online by expanding our free same-day paint delivery program via our gig network. And as a reminder, paint remains the number one home improvement project. So, we've added more brands and products to our same-day delivery options so customers can get what they need to finish their projects faster, delivered right to their home or job site. Customers are also leveraging our new in-store mode in the Lowe's app, which gives them product information at their fingertips. Through the app, they are able to quickly access product details, reviews and in-stock information and they can more easily navigate the store to find what they're looking for. And if they don't see the exact product, they need on the shelf, they can shop on the app right within the aisles of our stores, or a larger selection of products and finishes, from our extended aisle on Lowes.com. Another way we're driving traffic, both online and in-store is through our MyLowe's Rewards loyalty program, which we just launched in March. This free program is designed to reward DIY customers for choosing Lowe's over other retail competitors for their home improvement needs. Customers are engaging in the program to take advantage of new member-only offers, earn MyLowe's money and use their rewards. You'll hear more about our loyalty program from Bill later in the call. Now allow me to transition to the economy. When it comes to the macro environment, this remains a challenging home improvement market. While interest rates are beginning to drop, consumers continue to face affordability challenges as both inflation and interest rates are putting pressure on their wallet. Mortgage rates also remained stubbornly high and there's still a meaningful gap between current mortgage rates to purchase a home and the homeowners existing rates with over half of current rates below 4%. Combined with the lack of available homes for sale, housing turnover remains near 30-year lows. Looking ahead, it's unclear when lower rates and improved consumer sentiment will translate into improved home improvement demand. However, the three primary drivers of our business continue to work in our favor. One, strong home price appreciation. Two, disposable personal income is outpacing inflation. And three, the medium age of homes is the oldest it's been in U.S. history currently sitting at 41 years old. These drivers will support demand over the long term, which means existing homeowners are likely to continue investing in repairs and upgrades to their homes. Especially as interest rate pressures ease, we expect that homeowners will start to tap into the record $35 trillion in home equity to finance larger home improvement projects. These factors along with long-term demand drivers like millennial household formation, Baby Boomers aging in place and continued remote work reinforce our optimism around the medium- to long-term outlook for the home improvement industry. In the meantime, we're investing in our Total Home Strategy to position the Company for long-term growth and sustainable market share gains in preparation for the anticipated home improvement market recovery. We're looking forward to telling you more about our plans at our analyst and investor conference next month. Before I wrap up, I'd like to extend our thoughts and prayers to everyone who was impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. And I want to express my gratitude to our associates, suppliers and first responders for their efforts to support those in the storm's path. Working together, the teams provided round-the-clock support ahead of both hurricanes and immediately mobilize in their wake to help address urgent needs in impacted communities across the Southeast. As part of the larger storm recovery efforts in our company's history, Lowe's has pledged $12 million to support disaster relief assistance through several nonprofit organizations with boots on the ground. As part of this commitment, we recently announced plans to provide $2.5 million in grants and support to help small businesses in Western North Carolina recover and to rebuild. Joe, Bill and Brandon will each share more detail on Lowe's response efforts and provide more context on how these storms impacted our results. In closing, I'd like to thank all of our frontline associates for their dedication to serving our customers and supporting our communities. I especially would like to salute our frontline associates in Florida and North Carolina for their commitment to their neighbors and for their resiliency. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe to talk more about our storm recovery efforts and our store operations.\nJoe McFarland: Thank you, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. Hundreds of stores felt the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and our operations team worked tirelessly to get them up and running quickly, leveraging our improved disaster response capabilities that we have continued to enhance over the years. Investments in our supply chain network helped us mobilize essential supplies, staging inventory in nearby distribution center facilities more efficiently ahead of the storms and flowing products to impacted stores more quickly afterward. Recent investments in Pro job site delivery, especially in hurricane prone areas, also helped with our relief efforts so we can more quickly flow larger orders to our Pro customers to support their work helping homeowners recover. In the largest activation of its history, our command center team coordinated these efforts across the Company while district and store managers responded to the needs of their communities by ensuring that critical supplies were positioned for convenient access for our customers. Additionally, hundreds of associates have volunteered in Western North Carolina to clean houses, clear debris and serve warm meals. And I'm particularly grateful to the over 1,000 emergency response team members who voluntary left their homes to support stores in the impacted areas. These teams quickly mobilized to serve customers reeling from storm impacts and to relieve local associates so they could focus on their own recovery efforts. Despite the challenges posed by the storms, I'm pleased that we maintained our recent gains in customer satisfaction. This is a reflection of the investments we've made in tech-driven enhancements to the customer experience as well as the ongoing commitment of our associates to deliver outstanding customer service. Shifting gears to our performance in Pro. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered positive high single-digit Pro comp sales in the quarter, with broad-based growth across regions and merchandising categories. And we continue to deliver outsized growth in Pro online sales, driven by our enhanced digital offering for the Pro. We recently launched Shop the Job, a digital shopping experience that helps our Pro loyalty customers purchase everything they need for specific jobs more quickly and efficiently, cutting down in the time spent sending runners from job site to buy forgotten items. We launched this program with a focus on kitchen, bath and flooring projects and look forward to expanding to additional project types as we incorporate our Pro customers' feedback on this initial rollout. Looking ahead, Pros in our recent survey indicated that their backlogs remain strong and consistent with prior year. They also remain confident about their access to financing, labor and materials. All key factors drive the success of their business. Turning to our efforts to become the employer of choice in retail. A few weeks ago, we concluded our annual engagement survey, a critical component of our proactive associate listening strategy. Our 90-plus percent response rate is industry-leading and we're pleased that our preliminary scores across the key measures of engagement and leadership effectiveness continued to improve as past surveys show a correlation between more engaged associates and stronger business results driven by better customer service. As Marvin mentioned, we continue to see increased engagement in our MyLowe's Rewards programs, and we're pleased this quarter to recognize first responders by upgrading them automatically to silver key status. This is part of our Fourth Annual First Responders appreciation event held last month. This is just another way we're working to show our gratitude for the mission-critical work they do for our communities. Finally, I'm looking forward to discussing what's next on our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI road map, next month at the analyst and investor conference. We'll discuss our continuing efforts to elevate the customer experience while at the same time, enhancing labor productivity through tech-driven solutions. I would like to close by thanking all of our associates for their hard work and commitment to our customers. And now let me turn it over to Bill.\nBill Boltz: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the strong performance we delivered in Pro and online again this quarter. And while DIY bigger ticket discretionary demand remains pressured, we saw improved results in outdoor categories. Now turning to our results in hardlines, where we delivered positive comps driven in part by hurricane-related sales of products like generators, chainsaws, cleaning supplies, water, gas cans, tarps and flashlights. We also saw customers engage in projects to help their lawns recover from a summer of intense heat, which drove strength in outdoor categories like lawn care, landscape products and fall cleanup supplies. Taking all of this into account, we delivered positive comps for the quarter in both seasonal and outdoor living and hardware. Next, we're getting ready for the upcoming holiday season. We're offering customers innovative products at great values all season long. Starting with our new Black Friday buildup event. We're encouraging customers who are gearing up for the holidays to shop early with deals on top-rated CRAFTSMAN, DEWALT and Cobalt tools. And next week, we're excited to welcome customers to our Black Friday event where they can continue to save with online exclusive deals and special in-store offers that will be too good to pass up. During the event, MyLowe's Rewards loyalty members will also have early access to more exclusive doorbusters on Thanksgiving Day on Lowes.com. In fact, since tools are perfect holiday gifts for both the do-it-yourselfer and the Pro and your family, will have compelling offers from brands like Klein and DEWALT and DEWALT will take over the Pro drop zone in a big way throughout the holiday season. We're featuring a great selection of DEWALT's best-performing 20-Volt Max XR batteries and power tools, which have more power, longer run times and increased durability compared to a typical 20-volt battery. Turning to Building Products, where we delivered comps above the Company average, driven by positive comps in building materials with the continued strength in Pro as well as hurricane-related sales. And we're continuing to add to our powerful Pro brand arsenal by welcoming to Lowe's, the world leader in drywall tools, wallboard tools. This new assortment will include a comprehensive range of the best and most innovative products in the industry that caters to both seasoned drywall professionals and DIYers. With tools for every step of the drywall process, from taping knives and trowels to texturing and repair patches. We're also pleased to introduce the Pella Steady Set Interior Installation System, an innovative way for Pros to install windows from the inside. It's faster and safer than exterior installation because installers now won't have to carry a window of a ladder. This innovative solution turns a three-day installation into a one-day job and reduces latter time by 70%. This will be a game changer for Pros, making it easier than ever for them to provide high-quality window installation while cutting down on labor expense. Shifting now to home decor. We continue to see ongoing pressure in DIY bigger ticket discretionary projects in categories like flooring, kitchen and bath and decor. In appliances, third quarter comps improved slightly from our Q2 trends driven by growth in average ticket size. We delivered positive comps in laundry, partly driven by the expansion of the new all-in-one washer and dryer units and integrated wash towers. These new and exciting products are driving growth in laundry and reflect the customers' willingness to trade up for innovation and new products. Another example of consumers responding to innovation is in refrigeration with LG's new Zero Clearance line, which has a hinge system that allows homeowners to install the refrigerator in tight spaces and still fully open both doors with virtually no extra clearance needed. Finally, we're pleased to see continued momentum in our MyLowe's Rewards loyalty program with promising results in key performance metrics like repeat purchases, average order value and penetration of loyalty member purchases. And we're now leveraging the insights we gain from our loyalty program to transform our marketing with tailored offers by anticipating what customers need next. And we're reminding them to take advantage of their MyLowe's money sending them tailored offers to entice them to return and shop categories we know they've shopped before. We're also giving members exclusive access to new product launches like best customer events and doorbusters. In October, we launched our first ever member week with offers across categories like appliances, kitchens and bath, paint and more. For the first time, we now have the ability to drive our own event schedule for our DIY customers. Instead of being tied to the calendar, we can now create events when we see an opportunity to drive excitement, traffic and sales. In closing, I'd like to thank our supplier partners and merchants for their hard work and shared commitment to ensuring we have the right brands and the right assortment for our DIY and Pro customers. And I'd like to recognize two of our suppliers for their support of our storm recovery efforts. Starting with Niagara Water. This team sent more than 700 truckloads of additional bottled water from their plants outside of our typical network, in many cases, turning around our orders in less than 24 hours to help us serve our customers in need. And also, FIRMAN Power Equipment, they source generators from all around North America to get them to our stores and our customers in the hardest hit areas where their warehouse crews work literally overnight and through the weekends to ensure our emergency orders arrived in less than 24 hours. They also deployed two storm trailers with dedicated staff to Lowe's stores across Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, to help our customers start their generators, find the right product for their needs and even repair old units regardless of the brand. I want to thank them and all of our suppliers who stepped up to help during this difficult time. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Brandon.\nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Bill, and good morning. Beginning with our Q3 results, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.99. In the quarter, we recognized a pretax gain of $54 million on deferred consideration associated with the 2022 sale of our Canadian retail business. Excluding this benefit, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.89. My comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons that exclude this benefit were applicable. Third quarter sales were $20.2 billion with comparable sales down 1.1%. We estimate the demand generated by hurricanes, Helene and Milton positively impacted comp sales by roughly 100 basis points. Excluding the storm-related lift, sales came in modestly better than expected, driven by continued strength in Pro and online, as well as smaller outdoor projects as customers work to address the impact of intense summer heat on their outdoor living spaces. Comparable average ticket was up 0.2%, driven by strength in Pro, an increase in average ticket for appliances, and sales of storm-related products. Comparable transactions declined 1.3% as continued softness in DIY discretionary projects was partly offset by growth in Pro transactions. Our monthly comps were down 3.3% in August, down 1.2% in September and up 1.3% in October as hurricane-related sales positively impacted the second half of the quarter. Gross margin was 33.7% of sales in the third quarter, up slightly from prior year. Gross margin benefited from ongoing PPI initiatives, which were largely offset by continuing supply chain investments and storm-related pressures, which included mix pressure from lower-margin products like generators, chainsaws and lumber, incremental transportation costs to expedite product into affected areas and inventory losses from damages in multiple locations. Adjusted SG&A of 19.2% of sales delevered 86 basis points versus prior year. Adjusted SG&A was largely in line with our expectations except for direct storm-related expenses, which included philanthropic support for our communities and associates, repair and impairment costs for damaged stores and facilities and incremental labor and other operating expenses like using diesel generators to power buildings during extended electrical outages. Adjusted operating margin rate of 12.3% declined 86 basis points and the adjusted effective tax rate of 24.2% was in line with prior year. Inventory ended Q3 at $17.6 billion, which was roughly flat to prior year as we continue to manage our purchases in line with sales trends and invest in key Pro items. Now turning to capital allocation. In the third quarter, we generated $728 million of free cash flow. Capital expenditures totaled $571 million as we continue to invest in our key growth initiatives. We repurchased 2.9 million shares for $758 million and paid $654 million in dividends, returning over $1.4 billion to our shareholders. In September, we repaid a $450 million bond maturity and ended Q3 at adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR of 3.04x. And we delivered a return on invested capital of over 31%. Now turning to our outlook. We are updating our full year 2024 financial outlook to reflect better-than-expected third quarter results and anticipated modest storm-related demand in the fourth quarter. While our third quarter results came in ahead of expectations, much of it was driven by hurricane-related sales, while underlying DIY demand remains pressured, especially for discretionary projects. Taking these factors into account, we are now expecting 2024 sales in the range of $83 billion to $83.5 billion, with comparable sales in a range of down 3% to down 3.5%. We also now expect adjusted operating margin of between 12.3% and 12.4%, reflecting the benefits of our ongoing PPI initiatives as well as the incremental direct costs and a lower gross margin rate profile for storm-related activities. Additionally, we expect full year net interest expense of approximately $1.3 billion, capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion and adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5%. This results in an updated outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $11.80 to $11.90. I'm confident that our continued investments in our Total Home Strategy and our ability to effectively manage our business in any environment will allow us to navigate any near-term market uncertainty while continuing to deliver long-term shareholder value. And with that, we will open it up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.\nPeter Benedict: First, just on the DIY loyalty program, you mentioned better penetration levels and renewal rates or repeat rates, I should say, and AOV. Any more color you can add on that? I'm curious where those maybe sit and curious on the year two playbook for DIY loyalty? I imagine a lot has been focused on kind of gathering the membership at this point. But just curious kind of what the year two playbook looks like for the DIY loyalty program. That's my first question.\nMarvin Ellison: Peter, this is Marvin. I'll take your question. I would say we're really pleased with the entire program. As a reminder, we launched it in March, and we're continuing to see the membership build. This past October, we launched our first ever member week, which really allowed us to hit a record enrollment week based on that event. So, all in all, we're extremely pleased. We're seeing the key metrics that really matter for loyalty program. Things like repeat purchases, average order value for loyalty members. And we're also seeing a higher penetration of our loyalty members making larger purchases. Now the caveat is that we're going to provide a lot more detail on this program, not only kind of where we are, but where we're headed at the Analyst and Investor Conference next month. As a matter of fact, it's going to be one of our key discussion topics. So, we'll kind of hold off on talking about the future of the program until that time. Obviously, if Bill has any other specifics on the program just to share our degree of confidence and excitement around kind of what we're seeing thus far.\nBill Boltz: Peter, the only thing I would add is that in my prepared remarks, I talked about being able to offer some tailored events. And so next week, as we head into Black Friday on Thanksgiving Day, we'll give our members early access to some MyLowe's Rewards offers, and so we're excited about that. And as Marvin mentioned, we did our first ever October member-only week. And so, I think that allows us to learn a lot and we can work within our own calendar to create these exclusive events for our members and do some special things as we go forward.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. Great. That's helpful. My follow-up would just be around tariffs. Any way you want to frame kind of the exposure? And actually, even more interested in just what the playbook looks this time in the event some of the increases being tossed around come to fruition? Everybody went through this a handful of years ago. Just curious, your kind of approach, your level of exposure and your thoughts on tariffs if they are to increase here.\nMarvin Ellison: Yes. So, Peter, this is Marvin. I'll start it off by saying a statement of the obvious, and that is it's very early. And like everyone, we're waiting to see what happens when the Trump administration actually takes office in January. Having said that, we feel good about the processes and the systems we put in place since the first Trump administration to manage tariffs or other challenges. I'll hand it over to Bill to talk about some of the work we've done to diversify our sourcing over the past few years and then I'll see if Brandon after that has any additional comments.\nBill Boltz: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. We've built out what I think is probably one of the strongest teams in retail. And so as far as from a playbook perspective, we've got enhanced tools, a really strong process in order to deliver whatever gets thrown at us. In addition to Marvin's comment, we've been working over the last few years with our supplier partners and our private brand partners to diversify our products, and we'll continue to do that. And a big part of our playbook is to work closely with our suppliers to manage whatever comes our way. And so, we feel really comfortable and confident that we can address whatever is that gets thrown at us.\nBrandon Sink: Yes. And Peter, this is Brandon. Just as Marvin said, definitely staying very close to this. We're preparing internally for what may be coming from the new administration. I'll just mention roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the U.S. and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners. And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point. But just as Bill said, we believe we're well prepared to respond when and if it does happen.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.\nSteven Forbes: Marvin, maybe a follow-up to Peter's question on DIY. And really just wanted to get your higher-level thoughts on how you guys are thinking about planning the business for next year as we look at DIY trends, sort of this quarter, may be showing signs of stability on a multiyear basis? Or really just wanted to dig into how you guys are thinking about predicting or forecasting the DIY performance of the business, just given some of the challenging comps you've had over the past couple of years here? And if there's any sort of path or a visible path to a return to sort of stability in comp as it pertains to DIY?\nMarvin Ellison: No, Steve, thanks for the question. And look, I state all the time with the team that we have to accept our reality as a company. And the reality is we are a DIY dominant business, which means that this is very important to us. Our loyalty program that we launched this year was specifically designed around putting more control of the DIY business under our stewardship versus being victims to the macro or really victims to weather patterns. And so, we're excited next month to give some level of detail around the loyalty program and how we believe that, that's going to give us the ability to be more on offense, so to speak, when you think about the DIY customer. Now the reality is that the macro environment puts a lot of pressure on our DIY business because we kind of skew more to that big-ticket DIY discretionary. Think of appliances, think of flooring, kitchen and bath, et cetera. And so, we are requiring some positive response in the macro environment before we can change these trends the way that we would like. But our business thesis is really simple. We're going to continue to invest in Pro and online, and we're incredibly pleased with what we've seen thus far. Anytime you can deliver high single-digit positive comps in any category in this environment, you have to feel good about it. And as we've mentioned, we grew our online sales by 6%. So, our business thesis is if we can continue to grow Pro at 2x to market, we can continue to grow online, and we can get this DIY business just growing at market based on some macro support, we're going to have a really good financial outcome. And so, we're going to provide a lot of detail at the upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference, specifically around our thoughts on the DIY and more importantly, the initiatives that we're going to be either executing at a higher level or implementing that we believe is going to give us a lot more ability to drive this customer segment in the future.\nSteven Forbes: Appreciate the color there, Marvin. And just a quick follow-up for Brandon. Two parts on the storm-related impacts. I guess first, can you quantify the comp contribution in the latter two months of the period? And then as it specifically pertains to gross margin, what were the storm-related pressures on gross margin during the quarter?\nBrandon Sink: Yes, Steven, this is Brandon. Just as I said in the prepared remarks, 100 basis points impact to comps in Q3. That was weighted to the back half of the quarter. And again, that's largely related to prep cleanup activities. We saw strength in categories like generators, chainsaws, cleaning supplies and lumber. But again, the majority of that back half weighted. As it relates to our margins and pressure from the storms, really what we saw in terms of impacting gross margins, it's reflective of product mix. Again, categories like generators, OPE, we had incremental transportation, damaged inventory in multiple locations. And then from an SG&A standpoint, just a number of one-timers there as it relates to community support, facility repairs, store impairments and then just some incremental OpEx to support our stores. So definitely a bit of a drag on the incremental sales, mostly isolated to Q3.\nOperator: Our next questions are from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Can I just ask follow-up on maybe the hurricane and related to Q4. It looks like comps will be a little bit better because of hurricane but EBIT dollars doesn't look like it will be. So, is there anything unique on margin that's holding back Q4? And I apologize if you said it earlier and I missed it.\nBrandon Sink: No. I think, Simeon, this is Brandon. We are adding some modest storm-related benefit to Q4 in the top line. But from an operating margin standpoint, in Q4, excluding storm-related impacts as it relates to the full year roughly in line with the prior year outlook. So, as I mentioned, most of that is isolated to Q3. Slight impact on top line for Q4, but we're not expecting any sort of significant drags from a gross margin or operating margin standpoint in Q4.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And a follow-up on the Pro. It picked up on at least a single year basis. I think it's high single digits. So, can we talk about what's driving it? And I guess this may be difficult to answer, but when the cycle turns, curious, does traditionally do DIY or DIFM accelerate more? And I get DIY is a bit depressed relative to where you'd like it to be. But does that mean it necessarily comes up first? Or does the Pro strength continue given where it is?\nMarvin Ellison: So, Simeon, I'll take the first part of that, and I'll let Joe just give some specifics on some of the initiatives that we're seeing that's really driving the business. So, if I could take you back, I mean, when we started this journey back in 2018. I mean our Pro penetration was less than 20%, and we didn't really have a true strategy to speak of. And our Total Home Strategy is really starting to pay some benefits, and that's really driving the outperformance. The things that I can be very specific on that we're seeing this really resonating with our Pro customers, and let me remind you, this is the small to medium Pro customer, which has a total addressable market of about $250 billion, just that small to medium Pro. And so, our focus has been on expanding Pro brands, which Bill and his team have done just an incredible job of getting those brands that literally had walked away, or brands that we had to reintroduce to our company. We've improved service levels in the stores, and I'll let Joe speak specifically on that, and we've made just aggressive investments in what we call never out key SKUs to make sure that the Pro is always service when they come in to buy those items. And our loyalty program is providing some level of stickiness even though we're going to talk next month at the investor conference, some unique tweaks we're going to make to that. And digital online for Pro, grew double digits as well, and we're just really pleased with the fulfillment capabilities. So that's the snapshot of kind of how we performed as well as we did in Q3. Now as we think about the recovery, obviously, we don't have a crystal ball, but the way we look at it is what I said earlier. We're committed to growing Pro at 2x to market because we think that there's market share, we can continue to gain in the small to medium-sized Pro, we believe is up for grabs and also it's a very fragmented marketplace. So, we believe that what we designed can allow us to continue to grow that at 2x market. But when the market recovers, we believe that recovery is going to come in earners in that DIY big ticket and also for the do-it-for-me customer. And those are going to be two specific topics that we're going to be very purposeful in discussing at the upcoming conference around initiatives to drive that. So, when the inflection happens, we're going to be in a really good position as a company to take advantage of that inflation and have exactly what the customers need from technology and capabilities to serve them. Now let me just transition to Joe and he can talk specifically about some of the service initiatives in the store that's really helping us drive this Pro customer.\nJoe McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Simeon, as you know, we've been focused on the Pro for the last six years. And it's all part of the Total Home Strategy. And when I think about what is driving the Pros to choose Lowe's today, we talked a lot about the tools we continue to provide to the Pro. The easy in and out, the investments we're making in our outside sales teams, and more specifically, as you think about our Pro fulfillment centers that we've been focused on across the country. And so, these allow us to use these facilities in a dual purpose. And we're very pleased about the survey from Q3. The Pros backlogs continue to have a lot of strength. They continue to remain healthy, really focused on smaller projects, and we feel that our ability to service this Pro is taking share.\nOperator: Our next questions are from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: So, I'm going to try to go after the DIY question a little bit of a different way. It looks like DIY was maybe down 4%, the first half was down about 7%. Was this in line with your expectation? And then thinking forward, if you went back to post the financial crisis, there's a lot of small update projects like paint, some appliance replacement maybe some decor items and needs. So, as you look ahead, how does the progression of DIY over the year influence your view on not only like when DIY flips, but how it flips? And do you think that this next cycle, especially considering where rates are, looks like that past period of like 2010 to 2013?\nBrandon Sink: Yes. Chris, this is Brandon. I'll just speak to high-level DIY performance and this kind of ex-hurricane for the quarter. I would say our trends that we saw largely were in line with our expectations. As you mentioned, we continue to see strength in some of the smaller project activity. We called out outdoor projects. When we look at the DIY customer, they remain engaged across key events and continue to look for value. We saw that over Labor Day and the MyLowe's Rewards week. But certainly, continued underlying pressure in big-ticket discretionary, so categories like kitchen and bath, flooring and decor, and really continue to just see that tied to the macro. We look at mortgage rates that continue to remain elevated, consumer sentiment, housing turnover, affordability, continue to create pressure here in the near term. So, we do see that pressure sort of continuing as we transition from '24 and into '25. We are expecting some level of additional engagement and some acceleration as we move from smaller repairs into some of the larger projects, but really the timing of that and into '25. And when that happens is still continues to be uncertain. So that's what we're looking for as we look for an inflection point, but as it relates to the near term more in line with expectations at this point.\nMarvin Ellison: And Chris, this is Marvin. So, we've been very specific over the last few years on where we placed our capital investments, and we spent a lot on IT infrastructure on digital, and we spend a lot on store improvement. So, if you think about kitchen and bath showrooms, we have a best-in-class presentation in our stores, and we have a best-in-class experience online. When you think about appliances, we have a best-in-class appearance in our stores and presentation. We have the best assortment in retail, and we have the best experience online, where we're the only retailer that can ship almost virtually any zip code in the country next day and today. And so, my point is, is we don't know when the inflection is going to occur, but we think it will occur in a DIY, do-it-for-me category. And we made investments to position ourselves to be able to take market share and take our unfair share of the demand that will show up based on this $35 trillion in equity that's out there in these homes that are aging on average of 41 years old in U.S. history. So, we don't know when the inflection happens, but when it happens, we've been building our playbook to be prepared and positioned to get our fair share and get our unfair share of that market demand, and that's what the intent is for us and will again provide more specifics on that when we update on our long-term strategy next month.\nJoe McFarland: More specifically to your smaller projects, things that we've been focused on, our same-day delivery options for paint samples, ,expanding our gig delivery network, and then the infrastructure we've been building around our do-it-for-me business. We've been laser-focused on things like central selling to complement. And so again, is we don't know when the inflection point will happen. We're certainly confident in the investments we're making.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then my follow-up is a margin question. So, one, was the hurricane actually a net drag to earnings? It seems like that's what your point is too. Can you share any detail there? And then I know you changed your operating margin further for the storm impact. As you think about the gross margin, you had previously guided gross margin up in the third and fourth quarter. I think it would have been ex the storm impact. Do you still expect gross margin up in the fourth quarter?\nBrandon Sink: Yes, Chris, to the first part of your question, from an earnings standpoint, it was slightly accretive. So carried a lower margin profile, but still accretive to earnings when we look at the incrementality on the sales. And then your second part of your question on the gross margin profile, and I'm speaking for the year. Now, we still are roughly expecting flat for the full year. So that's inclusive of the hurricane-related pressure that we called out from Q3, ongoing headwinds as it relates to margin, our supply chain investments with market delivery and the early innings of pro fulfillment network. And then in terms of offsets, their merchant supply chain PPIs, so initiatives, including expanding private brands, pricing initiatives. And then, we're seeing really nice progress on the cost clawback with our suppliers, and we've seen that benefit accelerate as we move through the year and turn through inventory. And then other items in gross margin, items like credit and shrink continue to be roughly flat for the full year. So really great job by the teams managing those pressures.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Cleveland: Two things. First of all, Bill, you talked about and Marvin, you talked about as well, affordability challenges is something that's pressuring the consumer. I'm curious how you're thinking now and even in '25, what you're doing in response to that? I guess you talked about a couple of categories, appliances where maybe there was some trade up. But curious if as you think about promotions and price points, if you're doing anything in response to that, to better position the business for traffic with consumers or where you are now is where you want to stay?\nBill Boltz: Yes, Eric, great question. We've continued to stay focused, really laser focused on value. And as we've said in past meetings, value can come in a number of different ways. Value can certainly come through price, can come through new and innovative products, and we've seen it really come all three ways. And so, some of the stuff that I referenced in my prepared remarks, being able to drive some of these smaller projects is really value-driven based on getting the consumer focused on different projects and products across the store. And as we head into the holiday season, we're obviously excited about some of the new stuff that we're bringing. We've got great values across the board from Klein, DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN Cobalt. We've got great innovation coming from appliances as well as new products that we're introducing, as I called out, in my prepared remarks from LG in this laundry, this new innovation in laundry with the all-in-one is really a whole new segment. And that's not a low price point, but it's a great value product when a consumer looks to combine both the washer and a dryer in one, and now it's a category of products where it had only been one item in the past. And then as we said about MyLowe's Rewards, that gives us the opportunity to differentiate to our members and offer them best customer offers as well as exposure to new stuff ahead of time. So yes, to your question, we want to continue to do it through a number of different avenues, and we're going to be laser focused on it as we go forward just as we have been.\nEric Cleveland: Okay. And then secondly, as you think about, again, related or considering the affordability challenges. When you think of -- as you commented, sustained pressure on DIY and especially DIY discretionary, as you think about -- we don't know what's going to happen the tariffs, but we do know what's going to happen with tariffs that there's going to be some incremental cost and certainly on your direct sourced business. And then you think about managing expenses. I'm just curious how you think about managing expenses as it relates to margin in an environment with the sluggish demand with probably some incremental costs coming through? You've done a good job in the past and taking cost out to manage margins through this environment. I don't know, in terms of what's going on now, is there anything incremental or any incremental opportunity on the horizon in the area of managing expenses to manage margin?\nMarvin Ellison: So, Eric, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part, and then I'll hand it over to Brandon. I think relative to managing expenses, I would look at the reputation of this team and how well we have focus on, not only, just the fundamental management of the business and being really, really prudent on taking out costs and expenses, but also on our PPI initiatives and how that's permeated to every functional area of the Company. And so that's going to maintain irrespective of the macro environment, irrespective of our top line revenue, we're going to be laser-focused on taking our costs in managing expenses so we can get more of that flow through to the bottom line. I'll let Brandon add any additional...\nBrandon Sink: Yes, Marvin. Yes, Eric, just to add on what Marvin said. SG&A, excluding the hurricane benefits for this year, largely in line with our expectations. We're super pleased as to how we've been managing the business over the last three years amidst significant top line pressures. We've continued to make investments in our strategic initiatives, continue to manage our margins. We have great alignment across the organization to maintain disciplined expense management, effective cost controls. And then as Marvin mentioned, our PP&I initiatives where those have come into play, continue to flex the muscles to manage the P&L, really outrun our expectations for this year. So, we're going to continue with that. We have next ending of PPI initiatives we're going to talk through in December as we look ahead and continue to be pleased with the progress that we're making there on SG&A.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKaren Short: Just a few questions. The range in 4Q is very wide when I look at operating profit growth and margin expansion specifically. So maybe can you talk to that a little bit? And then I don't know where your philosophy is on breaking out storms just going forward, but can you give an impact of the storm specifically on October?\nBrandon Sink: So, Karen, I'll talk about your first question on the range. And really as it relates to operating margin and EPS, just a function of the 50 basis point range that we have for top line. Again, that assumes no improvement in underlying macro pressures. We still expect big ticket DIY pressure kind of across both ends of the range. And then really, when we look at Q4, weather can be volatile, the timing kind of intensity of storms can impact demand, and we also have one less shopping week between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which this year could create some volatility and that could impact how kind of holiday demand plays out. So, we try to be prudent in setting those expectations and allowed for a bit of that uncertainty as it relates to top line range, and that's reflected in the operating margin in EPS. And then I think to the second part of your question, we're comfortable given the guidance on the storm-related impact for the full quarter, the 100 basis points, and we're not going to get into the details of breaking that out by month.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then just my follow-up as it relates to your Analyst Day. Are you still thinking about a format that gives three scenarios? Or is that maybe too complicated?\nBrandon Sink: Yes, Karen. We're excited for Analyst Day. We will provide an update on financial expectations, one, for the home improvement market. And then as you mentioned, we're also looking forward to sharing some initial scenario planning is for 2025 and beyond. So, we are preparing to have that discussion here in a few weeks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays.\nSeth Sigman: Just a couple of margin follow-up questions. So, if you could just update us on the vendor callbacks, just the progress with that. It'd be great if you could quantify the benefit this quarter? And if you could just remind us, is this a onetime step up by kind of building up through this year and then we should expect more gradual gains from here as part of some of the processes you've put in place? Or any other way to think about that?\nBill Boltz: So, Seth, this is Bill. I'll take the first part, and I'll let Brandon have the second part of this. But I think it's important to remind everybody that cost management is an ongoing process that the teams are always involved in and we're obviously pleased with the progress that we've made this year to help reduce costs and close some of those back. And as we've talked about before, really appreciate the support of our supplier partners in order to do that. And then, we're looking to invest those -- some of those dollars to remain competitive in the market as it relates to price, using it to drive traffic and sales on seasonally relevant offers that make sense, as well as investing in marketing and in-store merchandising efforts so that we can put that money to work. But ongoing efforts and will remain an ongoing effort as we go forward.\nBrandon Sink: Yes. And Seth, just as it relates to quantification of that, I would just say, meeting our expectations as we outlined at the beginning of the year. And it was -- we did know it was back half loaded. So, as we've made progress with our suppliers, taking cost out, we expected that to flow through inventory and positively impact gross margin more significantly as we move through the back half of the year. But also, as Bill mentioned, we're continuing to invest and traffic driving initiatives that could be through better offers, reduce price, investments in advertising. So, it's going to kind of be sprinkled across different areas of the P&L at different times of the year. But just in terms of our overall goals that we set out at the beginning of the year, really nice progress against that.\nMarvin Ellison: And Seth, this is Marvin. I'll just add just one additional comment. When I arrived here, cost discussions with suppliers where emotional conversations with no internal data. And we've now built out a team, we built out systems, processes that are data-driven with component costs, with raw material costs and with a very detailed analysis that gives Bill's team and Brandon's team the ability to sit down and have very data-driven conversations with suppliers relative to any cost increase or cost clawback. And to Bill's point, this will be ongoing. It will be ongoing based on a much more robust process that we have in place that we didn't have before. And that's one of the main reasons why as we get into this unpredictability of a tariff environment. We're going to be very positioned to manage that as well as any other retailer in the world.\nSeth Sigman: I guess even with the idea that you can continue to reinvest back in the business, you have put out an algorithm that points to operating margin expansion based on certain revenue targets. As you think about next year, you're going to be lapping a lower gross margin in the first quarter, you'll be lapping some of these incremental hurricane costs, although I guess net-net, you've had a positive impact to EBIT. But I'm just curious, has your view changed at all about the operating leverage in the model, the type of comp you need to get that breakeven or operating leverage?\nBrandon Sink: Yes. This is Brandon. I would say you highlighted kind of our flow-through rule of thumb. And I would just say, it's just that, right. Directional framework on how we expect to manage through different sales environments. This team, as we've mentioned, has proven our ability to manage profitability well through the downturn that we've been experiencing, continue to deliver on PPI commitments. And as it relates to kind of reframing that and how we're thinking about specifically 2025 scenarios and even beyond. We're going to hold off really on that discussion. I look forward to sharing details plans next month at our AIC on that.\nMarvin Ellison: And Rob, with that, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Final question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Just a follow-up on Eric's question earlier. Your PPI efforts continue to be the gift that keeps on giving. Can you guys size up the opportunity set as we look ahead? Are there significant buckets to source from? Then my follow-up is you called out five of your 15 regions outperforming. Are there any commonalities across those areas. One of your competitors called out the West as being a pretty strong region for them over the past few quarters. Just curious if you're seeing that, too?\nMarvin Ellison: So relative to PPI, we're going to give a really robust update at the December Analyst Investor meeting. But at a high level, we think we're in the early innings. This is a gift that keeps on giving because we keep on working to gift, so we can continue to keep on giving. And a lot of it is technology driven and a lot of it is process driven, and we're really excited about the possibilities. And you will hear from almost every presenter at our upcoming conference in December on ways they are identifying PPI value within their functional areas. And relative to regional breakouts I would say, relatively consistent with the exception of hurricane-impacted areas, if you remove that, our overall performance was consistent relatively from coach to coast.\nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at our Analyst and Investor Conference on December 11.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes Lowe's third quarter 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brandon Sink",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning. Beginning with our Q3 results, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.99. In the quarter, we recognized a pretax gain of $54 million on deferred consideration associated with the 2022 sale of our Canadian retail business. Excluding this benefit, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.89. My comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons that exclude this benefit were applicable. Third quarter sales were $20.2 billion with comparable sales down 1.1%. We estimate the demand generated by hurricanes, Helene and Milton positively impacted comp sales by roughly 100 basis points. Excluding the storm-related lift, sales came in modestly better than expected, driven by continued strength in Pro and online, as well as smaller outdoor projects as customers work to address the impact of intense summer heat on their outdoor living spaces. Comparable average ticket was up 0.2%, driven by strength in Pro, an increase in average ticket for appliances, and sales of storm-related products. Comparable transactions declined 1.3% as continued softness in DIY discretionary projects was partly offset by growth in Pro transactions. Our monthly comps were down 3.3% in August, down 1.2% in September and up 1.3% in October as hurricane-related sales positively impacted the second half of the quarter. Gross margin was 33.7% of sales in the third quarter, up slightly from prior year. Gross margin benefited from ongoing PPI initiatives, which were largely offset by continuing supply chain investments and storm-related pressures, which included mix pressure from lower-margin products like generators, chainsaws and lumber, incremental transportation costs to expedite product into affected areas and inventory losses from damages in multiple locations. Adjusted SG&A of 19.2% of sales delevered 86 basis points versus prior year. Adjusted SG&A was largely in line with our expectations except for direct storm-related expenses, which included philanthropic support for our communities and associates, repair and impairment costs for damaged stores and facilities and incremental labor and other operating expenses like using diesel generators to power buildings during extended electrical outages. Adjusted operating margin rate of 12.3% declined 86 basis points and the adjusted effective tax rate of 24.2% was in line with prior year. Inventory ended Q3 at $17.6 billion, which was roughly flat to prior year as we continue to manage our purchases in line with sales trends and invest in key Pro items. Now turning to capital allocation. In the third quarter, we generated $728 million of free cash flow. Capital expenditures totaled $571 million as we continue to invest in our key growth initiatives. We repurchased 2.9 million shares for $758 million and paid $654 million in dividends, returning over $1.4 billion to our shareholders. In September, we repaid a $450 million bond maturity and ended Q3 at adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR of 3.04x. And we delivered a return on invested capital of over 31%. Now turning to our outlook. We are updating our full year 2024 financial outlook to reflect better-than-expected third quarter results and anticipated modest storm-related demand in the fourth quarter. While our third quarter results came in ahead of expectations, much of it was driven by hurricane-related sales, while underlying DIY demand remains pressured, especially for discretionary projects. Taking these factors into account, we are now expecting 2024 sales in the range of $83 billion to $83.5 billion, with comparable sales in a range of down 3% to down 3.5%. We also now expect adjusted operating margin of between 12.3% and 12.4%, reflecting the benefits of our ongoing PPI initiatives as well as the incremental direct costs and a lower gross margin rate profile for storm-related activities. Additionally, we expect full year net interest expense of approximately $1.3 billion, capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion and adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5%. This results in an updated outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $11.80 to $11.90. I'm confident that our continued investments in our Total Home Strategy and our ability to effectively manage our business in any environment will allow us to navigate any near-term market uncertainty while continuing to deliver long-term shareholder value. And with that, we will open it up for your questions. Yes. And Peter, this is Brandon. Just as Marvin said, definitely staying very close to this. We're preparing internally for what may be coming from the new administration. I'll just mention roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the U.S. and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners. And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point. But just as Bill said, we believe we're well prepared to respond when and if it does happen. Yes, Steven, this is Brandon. Just as I said in the prepared remarks, 100 basis points impact to comps in Q3. That was weighted to the back half of the quarter. And again, that's largely related to prep cleanup activities. We saw strength in categories like generators, chainsaws, cleaning supplies and lumber. But again, the majority of that back half weighted. As it relates to our margins and pressure from the storms, really what we saw in terms of impacting gross margins, it's reflective of product mix. Again, categories like generators, OPE, we had incremental transportation, damaged inventory in multiple locations. And then from an SG&A standpoint, just a number of one-timers there as it relates to community support, facility repairs, store impairments and then just some incremental OpEx to support our stores. So definitely a bit of a drag on the incremental sales, mostly isolated to Q3. No. I think, Simeon, this is Brandon. We are adding some modest storm-related benefit to Q4 in the top line. But from an operating margin standpoint, in Q4, excluding storm-related impacts as it relates to the full year roughly in line with the prior year outlook. So, as I mentioned, most of that is isolated to Q3. Slight impact on top line for Q4, but we're not expecting any sort of significant drags from a gross margin or operating margin standpoint in Q4. Yes. Chris, this is Brandon. I'll just speak to high-level DIY performance and this kind of ex-hurricane for the quarter. I would say our trends that we saw largely were in line with our expectations. As you mentioned, we continue to see strength in some of the smaller project activity. We called out outdoor projects. When we look at the DIY customer, they remain engaged across key events and continue to look for value. We saw that over Labor Day and the MyLowe's Rewards week. But certainly, continued underlying pressure in big-ticket discretionary, so categories like kitchen and bath, flooring and decor, and really continue to just see that tied to the macro. We look at mortgage rates that continue to remain elevated, consumer sentiment, housing turnover, affordability, continue to create pressure here in the near term. So, we do see that pressure sort of continuing as we transition from '24 and into '25. We are expecting some level of additional engagement and some acceleration as we move from smaller repairs into some of the larger projects, but really the timing of that and into '25. And when that happens is still continues to be uncertain. So that's what we're looking for as we look for an inflection point, but as it relates to the near term more in line with expectations at this point. Yes, Chris, to the first part of your question, from an earnings standpoint, it was slightly accretive. So carried a lower margin profile, but still accretive to earnings when we look at the incrementality on the sales. And then your second part of your question on the gross margin profile, and I'm speaking for the year. Now, we still are roughly expecting flat for the full year. So that's inclusive of the hurricane-related pressure that we called out from Q3, ongoing headwinds as it relates to margin, our supply chain investments with market delivery and the early innings of pro fulfillment network. And then in terms of offsets, their merchant supply chain PPIs, so initiatives, including expanding private brands, pricing initiatives. And then, we're seeing really nice progress on the cost clawback with our suppliers, and we've seen that benefit accelerate as we move through the year and turn through inventory. And then other items in gross margin, items like credit and shrink continue to be roughly flat for the full year. So really great job by the teams managing those pressures. Yes, Marvin. Yes, Eric, just to add on what Marvin said. SG&A, excluding the hurricane benefits for this year, largely in line with our expectations. We're super pleased as to how we've been managing the business over the last three years amidst significant top line pressures. We've continued to make investments in our strategic initiatives, continue to manage our margins. We have great alignment across the organization to maintain disciplined expense management, effective cost controls. And then as Marvin mentioned, our PP&I initiatives where those have come into play, continue to flex the muscles to manage the P&L, really outrun our expectations for this year. So, we're going to continue with that. We have next ending of PPI initiatives we're going to talk through in December as we look ahead and continue to be pleased with the progress that we're making there on SG&A. So, Karen, I'll talk about your first question on the range. And really as it relates to operating margin and EPS, just a function of the 50 basis point range that we have for top line. Again, that assumes no improvement in underlying macro pressures. We still expect big ticket DIY pressure kind of across both ends of the range. And then really, when we look at Q4, weather can be volatile, the timing kind of intensity of storms can impact demand, and we also have one less shopping week between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which this year could create some volatility and that could impact how kind of holiday demand plays out. So, we try to be prudent in setting those expectations and allowed for a bit of that uncertainty as it relates to top line range, and that's reflected in the operating margin in EPS. And then I think to the second part of your question, we're comfortable given the guidance on the storm-related impact for the full quarter, the 100 basis points, and we're not going to get into the details of breaking that out by month. Yes, Karen. We're excited for Analyst Day. We will provide an update on financial expectations, one, for the home improvement market. And then as you mentioned, we're also looking forward to sharing some initial scenario planning is for 2025 and beyond. So, we are preparing to have that discussion here in a few weeks. Yes. And Seth, just as it relates to quantification of that, I would just say, meeting our expectations as we outlined at the beginning of the year. And it was -- we did know it was back half loaded. So, as we've made progress with our suppliers, taking cost out, we expected that to flow through inventory and positively impact gross margin more significantly as we move through the back half of the year. But also, as Bill mentioned, we're continuing to invest and traffic driving initiatives that could be through better offers, reduce price, investments in advertising. So, it's going to kind of be sprinkled across different areas of the P&L at different times of the year. But just in terms of our overall goals that we set out at the beginning of the year, really nice progress against that. Yes. This is Brandon. I would say you highlighted kind of our flow-through rule of thumb. And I would just say, it's just that, right. Directional framework on how we expect to manage through different sales environments.

I look forward to sharing details plans next month at our AIC on that."

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before discussing our third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to offer my sympathy to the Marcus family on the passing of Bernie Marcus. Bernie and his partners Arthur Blank, Ken Langone and Pat Farrah invented the modern home improvement business model. And many years ago, Bernie took me under his wing to teach me the home improvement business. As a young executive eager to learn about merchandising, marketing and business strategy for one of the icons of the industry, I was surprised that during my first meeting, the only thing that Bernie talked about was the importance of people, both customers and associates. Bernie provided me with a lot of coaching, wisdom and advice during my early years in home improvement. He was a true original in every sense of the word. And because of his generosity and philanthropy, he leaves a legacy far beyond the home improvement industry. From me personally and from all of us at Lowe's, our thoughts and our prayers go out to his family and to his loved ones. Now allow me to transition to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were $20.2 billion and comparable sales were down 1.1%. Our results were modestly better than expected, even excluding storm-related activity driven by strong Pro and online sales and smaller ticket outdoor DIY projects. While demand for DIY discretionary bigger ticket projects remain soft, we're tightly managing our operating expenses and continuing to invest in our Total Home strategy. We're particularly pleased with the sustained strength we're delivering in two key areas: Pro and online sales. Our Pro sales were up again in Q3 with high single-digit positive comps. This growth is being driven by the investments we've made to better serve the small- to medium-sized Pro, which is our core Pro customer. Our efforts to transform the Pro shopping experience continue to pay dividends. We have the inventory depth and the brands that are the most important to these customers, and we're making it easy for them to shop in our stores and online, and through our Pro loyalty program, we're giving them reasons to keep coming back. Later in the call, Joe will provide more detail on our efforts to continue our momentum in Pro. We also continue to grow our online sales with 6% comparable sales growth. We've increased both online conversion and traffic, including a double-digit increase in traffic on our Lowe's mobile app. And we're making it easier and more convenient for customers to order paint and paint supplies online by expanding our free same-day paint delivery program via our gig network. And as a reminder, paint remains the number one home improvement project. So, we've added more brands and products to our same-day delivery options so customers can get what they need to finish their projects faster, delivered right to their home or job site. Customers are also leveraging our new in-store mode in the Lowe's app, which gives them product information at their fingertips. Through the app, they are able to quickly access product details, reviews and in-stock information and they can more easily navigate the store to find what they're looking for. And if they don't see the exact product, they need on the shelf, they can shop on the app right within the aisles of our stores, or a larger selection of products and finishes, from our extended aisle on Lowes.com. Another way we're driving traffic, both online and in-store is through our MyLowe's Rewards loyalty program, which we just launched in March. This free program is designed to reward DIY customers for choosing Lowe's over other retail competitors for their home improvement needs. Customers are engaging in the program to take advantage of new member-only offers, earn MyLowe's money and use their rewards. You'll hear more about our loyalty program from Bill later in the call. Now allow me to transition to the economy. When it comes to the macro environment, this remains a challenging home improvement market. While interest rates are beginning to drop, consumers continue to face affordability challenges as both inflation and interest rates are putting pressure on their wallet. Mortgage rates also remained stubbornly high and there's still a meaningful gap between current mortgage rates to purchase a home and the homeowners existing rates with over half of current rates below 4%. Combined with the lack of available homes for sale, housing turnover remains near 30-year lows. Looking ahead, it's unclear when lower rates and improved consumer sentiment will translate into improved home improvement demand. However, the three primary drivers of our business continue to work in our favor. One, strong home price appreciation. Two, disposable personal income is outpacing inflation. And three, the medium age of homes is the oldest it's been in U.S. history currently sitting at 41 years old. These drivers will support demand over the long term, which means existing homeowners are likely to continue investing in repairs and upgrades to their homes. Especially as interest rate pressures ease, we expect that homeowners will start to tap into the record $35 trillion in home equity to finance larger home improvement projects. These factors along with long-term demand drivers like millennial household formation, Baby Boomers aging in place and continued remote work reinforce our optimism around the medium- to long-term outlook for the home improvement industry. In the meantime, we're investing in our Total Home Strategy to position the Company for long-term growth and sustainable market share gains in preparation for the anticipated home improvement market recovery. We're looking forward to telling you more about our plans at our analyst and investor conference next month. Before I wrap up, I'd like to extend our thoughts and prayers to everyone who was impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. And I want to express my gratitude to our associates, suppliers and first responders for their efforts to support those in the storm's path. Working together, the teams provided round-the-clock support ahead of both hurricanes and immediately mobilize in their wake to help address urgent needs in impacted communities across the Southeast. As part of the larger storm recovery efforts in our company's history, Lowe's has pledged $12 million to support disaster relief assistance through several nonprofit organizations with boots on the ground. As part of this commitment, we recently announced plans to provide $2.5 million in grants and support to help small businesses in Western North Carolina recover and to rebuild. Joe, Bill and Brandon will each share more detail on Lowe's response efforts and provide more context on how these storms impacted our results. In closing, I'd like to thank all of our frontline associates for their dedication to serving our customers and supporting our communities. I especially would like to salute our frontline associates in Florida and North Carolina for their commitment to their neighbors and for their resiliency. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe to talk more about our storm recovery efforts and our store operations. Peter, this is Marvin. I'll take your question. I would say we're really pleased with the entire program. As a reminder, we launched it in March, and we're continuing to see the membership build. This past October, we launched our first ever member week, which really allowed us to hit a record enrollment week based on that event. So, all in all, we're extremely pleased. We're seeing the key metrics that really matter for loyalty program. Things like repeat purchases, average order value for loyalty members. And we're also seeing a higher penetration of our loyalty members making larger purchases. Now the caveat is that we're going to provide a lot more detail on this program, not only kind of where we are, but where we're headed at the Analyst and Investor Conference next month. As a matter of fact, it's going to be one of our key discussion topics. So, we'll kind of hold off on talking about the future of the program until that time. Obviously, if Bill has any other specifics on the program just to share our degree of confidence and excitement around kind of what we're seeing thus far. Yes. So, Peter, this is Marvin. I'll start it off by saying a statement of the obvious, and that is it's very early. And like everyone, we're waiting to see what happens when the Trump administration actually takes office in January. Having said that, we feel good about the processes and the systems we put in place since the first Trump administration to manage tariffs or other challenges. I'll hand it over to Bill to talk about some of the work we've done to diversify our sourcing over the past few years and then I'll see if Brandon after that has any additional comments. No, Steve, thanks for the question. And look, I state all the time with the team that we have to accept our reality as a company. And the reality is we are a DIY dominant business, which means that this is very important to us. Our loyalty program that we launched this year was specifically designed around putting more control of the DIY business under our stewardship versus being victims to the macro or really victims to weather patterns. And so, we're excited next month to give some level of detail around the loyalty program and how we believe that, that's going to give us the ability to be more on offense, so to speak, when you think about the DIY customer. Now the reality is that the macro environment puts a lot of pressure on our DIY business because we kind of skew more to that big-ticket DIY discretionary. Think of appliances, think of flooring, kitchen and bath, et cetera. And so, we are requiring some positive response in the macro environment before we can change these trends the way that we would like. But our business thesis is really simple. We're going to continue to invest in Pro and online, and we're incredibly pleased with what we've seen thus far. Anytime you can deliver high single-digit positive comps in any category in this environment, you have to feel good about it. And as we've mentioned, we grew our online sales by 6%. So, our business thesis is if we can continue to grow Pro at 2x to market, we can continue to grow online, and we can get this DIY business just growing at market based on some macro support, we're going to have a really good financial outcome. And so, we're going to provide a lot of detail at the upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference, specifically around our thoughts on the DIY and more importantly, the initiatives that we're going to be either executing at a higher level or implementing that we believe is going to give us a lot more ability to drive this customer segment in the future. So, Simeon, I'll take the first part of that, and I'll let Joe just give some specifics on some of the initiatives that we're seeing that's really driving the business. So, if I could take you back, I mean, when we started this journey back in 2018. I mean our Pro penetration was less than 20%, and we didn't really have a true strategy to speak of. And our Total Home Strategy is really starting to pay some benefits, and that's really driving the outperformance. The things that I can be very specific on that we're seeing this really resonating with our Pro customers, and let me remind you, this is the small to medium Pro customer, which has a total addressable market of about $250 billion, just that small to medium Pro. And so, our focus has been on expanding Pro brands, which Bill and his team have done just an incredible job of getting those brands that literally had walked away, or brands that we had to reintroduce to our company. We've improved service levels in the stores, and I'll let Joe speak specifically on that, and we've made just aggressive investments in what we call never out key SKUs to make sure that the Pro is always service when they come in to buy those items. And our loyalty program is providing some level of stickiness even though we're going to talk next month at the investor conference, some unique tweaks we're going to make to that. And digital online for Pro, grew double digits as well, and we're just really pleased with the fulfillment capabilities. So that's the snapshot of kind of how we performed as well as we did in Q3. Now as we think about the recovery, obviously, we don't have a crystal ball, but the way we look at it is what I said earlier. We're committed to growing Pro at 2x to market because we think that there's market share, we can continue to gain in the small to medium-sized Pro, we believe is up for grabs and also it's a very fragmented marketplace. So, we believe that what we designed can allow us to continue to grow that at 2x market. But when the market recovers, we believe that recovery is going to come in earners in that DIY big ticket and also for the do-it-for-me customer. And those are going to be two specific topics that we're going to be very purposeful in discussing at the upcoming conference around initiatives to drive that. So, when the inflection happens, we're going to be in a really good position as a company to take advantage of that inflation and have exactly what the customers need from technology and capabilities to serve them. Now let me just transition to Joe and he can talk specifically about some of the service initiatives in the store that's really helping us drive this Pro customer. And Chris, this is Marvin. So, we've been very specific over the last few years on where we placed our capital investments, and we spent a lot on IT infrastructure on digital, and we spend a lot on store improvement. So, if you think about kitchen and bath showrooms, we have a best-in-class presentation in our stores, and we have a best-in-class experience online. When you think about appliances, we have a best-in-class appearance in our stores and presentation. We have the best assortment in retail, and we have the best experience online, where we're the only retailer that can ship almost virtually any zip code in the country next day and today. And so, my point is, is we don't know when the inflection is going to occur, but we think it will occur in a DIY, do-it-for-me category. And we made investments to position ourselves to be able to take market share and take our unfair share of the demand that will show up based on this $35 trillion in equity that's out there in these homes that are aging on average of 41 years old in U.S. history. So, we don't know when the inflection happens, but when it happens, we've been building our playbook to be prepared and positioned to get our fair share and get our unfair share of that market demand, and that's what the intent is for us and will again provide more specifics on that when we update on our long-term strategy next month. So, Eric, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part, and then I'll hand it over to Brandon. I think relative to managing expenses, I would look at the reputation of this team and how well we have focus on, not only, just the fundamental management of the business and being really, really prudent on taking out costs and expenses, but also on our PPI initiatives and how that's permeated to every functional area of the Company. And so that's going to maintain irrespective of the macro environment, irrespective of our top line revenue, we're going to be laser-focused on taking our costs in managing expenses so we can get more of that flow through to the bottom line. I'll let Brandon add any additional... And Seth, this is Marvin. I'll just add just one additional comment. When I arrived here, cost discussions with suppliers where emotional conversations with no internal data. And we've now built out a team, we built out systems, processes that are data-driven with component costs, with raw material costs and with a very detailed analysis that gives Bill's team and Brandon's team the ability to sit down and have very data-driven conversations with suppliers relative to any cost increase or cost clawback. And to Bill's point, this will be ongoing. It will be ongoing based on a much more robust process that we have in place that we didn't have before. And that's one of the main reasons why as we get into this unpredictability of a tariff environment. We're going to be very positioned to manage that as well as any other retailer in the world. And Rob, with that, we have time for one more question. So relative to PPI, we're going to give a really robust update at the December Analyst Investor meeting. But at a high level, we think we're in the early innings. This is a gift that keeps on giving because we keep on working to gift, so we can continue to keep on giving. And a lot of it is technology driven and a lot of it is process driven, and we're really excited about the possibilities. And you will hear from almost every presenter at our upcoming conference in December on ways they are identifying PPI value within their functional areas. And relative to regional breakouts I would say, relatively consistent with the exception of hurricane-impacted areas, if you remove that, our overall performance was consistent relatively from coach to coast."

            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the strong performance we delivered in Pro and online again this quarter. And while DIY bigger ticket discretionary demand remains pressured, we saw improved results in outdoor categories. Now turning to our results in hardlines, where we delivered positive comps driven in part by hurricane-related sales of products like generators, chainsaws, cleaning supplies, water, gas cans, tarps and flashlights. We also saw customers engage in projects to help their lawns recover from a summer of intense heat, which drove strength in outdoor categories like lawn care, landscape products and fall cleanup supplies. Taking all of this into account, we delivered positive comps for the quarter in both seasonal and outdoor living and hardware. Next, we're getting ready for the upcoming holiday season. We're offering customers innovative products at great values all season long. Starting with our new Black Friday buildup event. We're encouraging customers who are gearing up for the holidays to shop early with deals on top-rated CRAFTSMAN, DEWALT and Cobalt tools. And next week, we're excited to welcome customers to our Black Friday event where they can continue to save with online exclusive deals and special in-store offers that will be too good to pass up. During the event, MyLowe's Rewards loyalty members will also have early access to more exclusive doorbusters on Thanksgiving Day on Lowes.com. In fact, since tools are perfect holiday gifts for both the do-it-yourselfer and the Pro and your family, will have compelling offers from brands like Klein and DEWALT and DEWALT will take over the Pro drop zone in a big way throughout the holiday season. We're featuring a great selection of DEWALT's best-performing 20-Volt Max XR batteries and power tools, which have more power, longer run times and increased durability compared to a typical 20-volt battery. Turning to Building Products, where we delivered comps above the Company average, driven by positive comps in building materials with the continued strength in Pro as well as hurricane-related sales. And we're continuing to add to our powerful Pro brand arsenal by welcoming to Lowe's, the world leader in drywall tools, wallboard tools. This new assortment will include a comprehensive range of the best and most innovative products in the industry that caters to both seasoned drywall professionals and DIYers. With tools for every step of the drywall process, from taping knives and trowels to texturing and repair patches. We're also pleased to introduce the Pella Steady Set Interior Installation System, an innovative way for Pros to install windows from the inside. It's faster and safer than exterior installation because installers now won't have to carry a window of a ladder. This innovative solution turns a three-day installation into a one-day job and reduces latter time by 70%. This will be a game changer for Pros, making it easier than ever for them to provide high-quality window installation while cutting down on labor expense. Shifting now to home decor. We continue to see ongoing pressure in DIY bigger ticket discretionary projects in categories like flooring, kitchen and bath and decor. In appliances, third quarter comps improved slightly from our Q2 trends driven by growth in average ticket size. We delivered positive comps in laundry, partly driven by the expansion of the new all-in-one washer and dryer units and integrated wash towers. These new and exciting products are driving growth in laundry and reflect the customers' willingness to trade up for innovation and new products. Another example of consumers responding to innovation is in refrigeration with LG's new Zero Clearance line, which has a hinge system that allows homeowners to install the refrigerator in tight spaces and still fully open both doors with virtually no extra clearance needed. Finally, we're pleased to see continued momentum in our MyLowe's Rewards loyalty program with promising results in key performance metrics like repeat purchases, average order value and penetration of loyalty member purchases. And we're now leveraging the insights we gain from our loyalty program to transform our marketing with tailored offers by anticipating what customers need next. And we're reminding them to take advantage of their MyLowe's money sending them tailored offers to entice them to return and shop categories we know they've shopped before. We're also giving members exclusive access to new product launches like best customer events and doorbusters. In October, we launched our first ever member week with offers across categories like appliances, kitchens and bath, paint and more. For the first time, we now have the ability to drive our own event schedule for our DIY customers. Instead of being tied to the calendar, we can now create events when we see an opportunity to drive excitement, traffic and sales. In closing, I'd like to thank our supplier partners and merchants for their hard work and shared commitment to ensuring we have the right brands and the right assortment for our DIY and Pro customers. And I'd like to recognize two of our suppliers for their support of our storm recovery efforts. Starting with Niagara Water. This team sent more than 700 truckloads of additional bottled water from their plants outside of our typical network, in many cases, turning around our orders in less than 24 hours to help us serve our customers in need. And also, FIRMAN Power Equipment, they source generators from all around North America to get them to our stores and our customers in the hardest hit areas where their warehouse crews work literally overnight and through the weekends to ensure our emergency orders arrived in less than 24 hours. They also deployed two storm trailers with dedicated staff to Lowe's stores across Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, to help our customers start their generators, find the right product for their needs and even repair old units regardless of the brand. I want to thank them and all of our suppliers who stepped up to help during this difficult time. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Brandon. Peter, the only thing I would add is that in my prepared remarks, I talked about being able to offer some tailored events. And so next week, as we head into Black Friday on Thanksgiving Day, we'll give our members early access to some MyLowe's Rewards offers, and so we're excited about that. And as Marvin mentioned, we did our first ever October member-only week. And so, I think that allows us to learn a lot and we can work within our own calendar to create these exclusive events for our members and do some special things as we go forward. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. We've built out what I think is probably one of the strongest teams in retail. And so as far as from a playbook perspective, we've got enhanced tools, a really strong process in order to deliver whatever gets thrown at us. In addition to Marvin's comment, we've been working over the last few years with our supplier partners and our private brand partners to diversify our products, and we'll continue to do that. And a big part of our playbook is to work closely with our suppliers to manage whatever comes our way. And so, we feel really comfortable and confident that we can address whatever is that gets thrown at us. Yes, Eric, great question. We've continued to stay focused, really laser focused on value. And as we've said in past meetings, value can come in a number of different ways. Value can certainly come through price, can come through new and innovative products, and we've seen it really come all three ways. And so, some of the stuff that I referenced in my prepared remarks, being able to drive some of these smaller projects is really value-driven based on getting the consumer focused on different projects and products across the store. And as we head into the holiday season, we're obviously excited about some of the new stuff that we're bringing. We've got great values across the board from Klein, DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN Cobalt. We've got great innovation coming from appliances as well as new products that we're introducing, as I called out, in my prepared remarks from LG in this laundry, this new innovation in laundry with the all-in-one is really a whole new segment. And that's not a low price point, but it's a great value product when a consumer looks to combine both the washer and a dryer in one, and now it's a category of products where it had only been one item in the past. And then as we said about MyLowe's Rewards, that gives us the opportunity to differentiate to our members and offer them best customer offers as well as exposure to new stuff ahead of time. So yes, to your question, we want to continue to do it through a number of different avenues, and we're going to be laser focused on it as we go forward just as we have been. So, Seth, this is Bill. I'll take the first part, and I'll let Brandon have the second part of this. But I think it's important to remind everybody that cost management is an ongoing process that the teams are always involved in and we're obviously pleased with the progress that we've made this year to help reduce costs and close some of those back. And as we've talked about before, really appreciate the support of our supplier partners in order to do that. And then, we're looking to invest those -- some of those dollars to remain competitive in the market as it relates to price, using it to drive traffic and sales on seasonally relevant offers that make sense, as well as investing in marketing and in-store merchandising efforts so that we can put that money to work. But ongoing efforts and will remain an ongoing effort as we go forward."

            "name": "Joe McFarland",
            "content": "Thank you, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. Hundreds of stores felt the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and our operations team worked tirelessly to get them up and running quickly, leveraging our improved disaster response capabilities that we have continued to enhance over the years. Investments in our supply chain network helped us mobilize essential supplies, staging inventory in nearby distribution center facilities more efficiently ahead of the storms and flowing products to impacted stores more quickly afterward. Recent investments in Pro job site delivery, especially in hurricane prone areas, also helped with our relief efforts so we can more quickly flow larger orders to our Pro customers to support their work helping homeowners recover. In the largest activation of its history, our command center team coordinated these efforts across the Company while district and store managers responded to the needs of their communities by ensuring that critical supplies were positioned for convenient access for our customers. Additionally, hundreds of associates have volunteered in Western North Carolina to clean houses, clear debris and serve warm meals. And I'm particularly grateful to the over 1,000 emergency response team members who voluntary left their homes to support stores in the impacted areas. These teams quickly mobilized to serve customers reeling from storm impacts and to relieve local associates so they could focus on their own recovery efforts. Despite the challenges posed by the storms, I'm pleased that we maintained our recent gains in customer satisfaction. This is a reflection of the investments we've made in tech-driven enhancements to the customer experience as well as the ongoing commitment of our associates to deliver outstanding customer service. Shifting gears to our performance in Pro. As Marvin mentioned, we delivered positive high single-digit Pro comp sales in the quarter, with broad-based growth across regions and merchandising categories. And we continue to deliver outsized growth in Pro online sales, driven by our enhanced digital offering for the Pro. We recently launched Shop the Job, a digital shopping experience that helps our Pro loyalty customers purchase everything they need for specific jobs more quickly and efficiently, cutting down in the time spent sending runners from job site to buy forgotten items. We launched this program with a focus on kitchen, bath and flooring projects and look forward to expanding to additional project types as we incorporate our Pro customers' feedback on this initial rollout. Looking ahead, Pros in our recent survey indicated that their backlogs remain strong and consistent with prior year. They also remain confident about their access to financing, labor and materials. All key factors drive the success of their business. Turning to our efforts to become the employer of choice in retail. A few weeks ago, we concluded our annual engagement survey, a critical component of our proactive associate listening strategy. Our 90-plus percent response rate is industry-leading and we're pleased that our preliminary scores across the key measures of engagement and leadership effectiveness continued to improve as past surveys show a correlation between more engaged associates and stronger business results driven by better customer service. As Marvin mentioned, we continue to see increased engagement in our MyLowe's Rewards programs, and we're pleased this quarter to recognize first responders by upgrading them automatically to silver key status. This is part of our Fourth Annual First Responders appreciation event held last month. This is just another way we're working to show our gratitude for the mission-critical work they do for our communities. Finally, I'm looking forward to discussing what's next on our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI road map, next month at the analyst and investor conference. We'll discuss our continuing efforts to elevate the customer experience while at the same time, enhancing labor productivity through tech-driven solutions. I would like to close by thanking all of our associates for their hard work and commitment to our customers. And now let me turn it over to Bill. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Simeon, as you know, we've been focused on the Pro for the last six years. And it's all part of the Total Home Strategy. And when I think about what is driving the Pros to choose Lowe's today, we talked a lot about the tools we continue to provide to the Pro. The easy in and out, the investments we're making in our outside sales teams, and more specifically, as you think about our Pro fulfillment centers that we've been focused on across the country. And so, these allow us to use these facilities in a dual purpose. And we're very pleased about the survey from Q3. The Pros backlogs continue to have a lot of strength. They continue to remain healthy, really focused on smaller projects, and we feel that our ability to service this Pro is taking share. More specifically to your smaller projects, things that we've been focused on, our same-day delivery options for paint samples, ,expanding our gig delivery network, and then the infrastructure we've been building around our do-it-for-me business. We've been laser-focused on things like central selling to complement. And so again, is we don't know when the inflection point will happen. We're certainly confident in the investments we're making."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Lowe's Companies Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2024. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to US GAAP can be found on the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Marvin.\nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Second quarter sales were $23.6 billion, with comparable sales down 5.1% from the same period last year. While we're pleased that we delivered positive comps in Pro and online sales, we continue to manage through softness in DIY demand. Although this remains a challenging industry backdrop for the homeowner, I'm pleased with our team's ability to effectively manage the business. This is reflected in our disciplined expense management across the company, along with continual progress on our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI, initiatives. These efforts helped us respond to the pullback in DIY discretionary projects and unpredictable weather across the country to deliver better-than-expected flow-through, while improving the customer experience. Later in the call, Joe will provide more detail on our improved customer service results in Q2. We're also encouraged to see results from our ongoing investments in our Total Home strategy this quarter, allowing us to deliver mid-single-digit positive comps in Pro and 2.9% comparable sales growth online. This demonstrates the importance of these strategic investments and shows that our Total Home strategy is gaining traction even in this pressured macro environment. Our resilient small-to-medium Pro customers are responding to the way we've transformed our product and service offerings to meet their needs. Bill and Joe will provide more detail on our successful Pro initiatives later in the call. When it comes to online sales, we delivered growth across all three business areas, driven by continued improvement in conversion rates as customers responded to our compelling offers and to our new expanded same-day delivery options that are now available on multiple platforms. In Q2, we added Uber Eats to our list of delivery partners, which also includes DoorDash, Shipt and Instacart, in addition to our last-mile technology partner, OneRail, provides a fully integrated solution available on lowes.com and in store. As we continue to involve our omnichannel strategy, we've learned that having multiple delivery platforms extend our reach into both urban and suburban areas and helps us drive incremental sales with different types of customers, especially younger generations who are more digitally savvy. We're also reaching a broader customer base and making a deeper connection with our new and existing customers through our marketing campaigns, featuring sports icons like Lionel Messi, widely recognized as the best soccer player in the world. We have very effectively leveraged our partnership with Messi to gain exposure to our new DIY loyalty program, MyLowe's Rewards. Overall, we're very pleased with our MyLowe's Rewards loyalty program, which just launched nationwide in March. And through this program, we've learned more about our customers' lifestyle and purchasing trends, which will allow us to curate meaningful offers for them now and in the future. Now let me tell you about how we're leading the way with innovation and home improvement. Lowe's is working with Apple to help customers visualize and design their dream kitchens using Apple Vision Pro. This past quarter, we piloted an in-store design experience for our customers in three test markets, where with the help from a Lowe's associate, customers could wear the Apple Vision Pro and use the Lowe's Style Studio app to explore and customize hundreds of kitchen designs in 3D using products, fixtures and appliances all available at Lowe's. This is just one example of how we're leaning into innovation, while we're also working with leading platforms like NVIDIA, OpenAI and Palantir to develop AI solutions for both our customer and our associates to help us improve how we sell, shop and how we work. Before I close, let me give you an update on the trends we're seeing in the macro environment. At the beginning of the year, our full year outlook reflected our expectation that macro and consumer trends in 2024 would be similar to the back half in 2023. That assessment has turned out to be accurate, and yet there still remains a great deal of uncertainty, particularly around interest rates and inflation. In terms of housing specifically, we're seeing significant implications as a result of a lock-in effect. Simply put, people aren't moving nearly as often as they typically do because current mortgage rates are so much higher than their existing rates. And as a consequence, housing turnover is hovering near its lowest levels since the mid-1990s. And the preference for spending on services, especially for the more affluent consumer, has persisted much longer than expected. That said, the three core drivers of our business remain strong: home prices continue to appreciate, which is sustaining historically high levels of home equity; disposal personal income is now growing faster than inflation; and the aging housing stock means people will need to make repairs and improvements in their homes. When you combine those factors with trends like a large number of millennial-forming households, baby boomers aging in place and people continuing to work from home, we remain optimistic about the medium- to long-term outlook of the home improvement industry. And in the meantime, our operating philosophy in this challenging home improvement macro environment is very straightforward: we will continue to invest in technology and innovation, we'll offer our customers value and differentiation whenever and however they choose to shop, and we will be incredibly disciplined with our expense management. We will achieve this by improving our operational efficiency through our PPI initiatives and making the right investments in our Total Home strategy. Although we are unable to call the date for the recovery in home improvement, we are confident that we'll be in a strong position to take share when the market begins to inflect. In closing, I want to thank our frontline associates for their dedication to our customers and communities. One of the best parts of my job is visiting stores every week. And in the first half of this year, I personally visited all 15 geographic regions. These store visits give me an opportunity to personally thank our wonderful associates for their hard work and provide me with invaluable insights into how we can continually enhance our customer experience. Thank you again for joining us this morning. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. Despite continuing softness in DIY discretionary demand, we're pleased that we delivered positive online comps and mid-single-digit positive Pro comps this quarter. We now have the right brands for Pros, the right inventory quantities and the right product assortments to meet the needs of this demanding customer. Our strong Pro performance in this challenging macro environment means that our efforts to transform the Pro customer experience are working. Now turning to our results in building products, where we delivered above-average comps in rough plumbing, electrical and millwork, and positive comps in building materials, driven by continued growth in Pro across all building materials subdivisions. Within rough plumbing, we also drove strong results in some hot weather categories, like air circulation and HVAC, and we continue to deliver strong results in water heaters. Just one warm weather example. We recently rolled out MRCOOL mini split air conditioners in 1,200 stores. These ductless systems are known for their advanced technology, energy efficiency and ease of insulation, which means our DIY customers can now install their own mini HVAC system without having to hire a professional installer. Now let's shift gears to home decor. We continue to see persistent pressure in bigger-ticket DIY discretionary projects in flooring and kitchen and bath, consistent with the trends that began in the third quarter of 2023. And we continue to lead the industry in appliances, and we are pleased with our overall performance where we delivered above-average comps and double-digit growth in Pro sales. When you put it all together, we have the whole package for custom shopping for new appliances. We have the widest assortment of the leading brands. We have a simple and seamless shopping experience, both in-store and online. And we have a best-in-class fulfillment solution with next-day and two-day delivery options, thanks to our multiyear investment in our market delivery infrastructure. And we continue to bring the most innovative products to market, like the Lowe's exclusive Hisense convertible four-door refrigerator, which has a fingerprint-resistant finish and an extra storage drawer with different temperature settings that can be controlled over WiFi from your mobile phone. In paint, we are now partnering with Sherwin-Williams to offer customers free same-day delivery nationwide. Since painting is the number one home improvement project, we're making it easy and convenient for customers to order paint and paint supplies online and get it all delivered quickly right to their door. This delivery option is just another added convenience, especially if you happen to run short or out of supplies in the middle of a painting project. Now let's talk about hardlines, where unfavorable weather pressured traditional spring seasonal categories like lawn and garden and seasonal and outdoor living. Given our DIY customer mix, sales pressure in these two DIY-dominant categories greatly impacted overall comp sales for the quarter. In outdoor power equipment, the addition of Toro now gives us the strongest lineup in the industry, along with John Deere, Aaron's, EGO, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Kobalt and SKIL; no one can beat it. In tools, we're expanding our collection of private-branded cobalt tools with a 24-volt paint sprayer, multi-material cutter and finish nailer. And with our introduction of Klein Tools and their new KNECT system, which is an impact rated system of sockets, drivers and ratchets that are compatible with both hand tools and power tools, this system is proprietary to Klein, the number one brand for electricians and HVAC professionals. And KNECT is also exclusive to Lowe's in the home center channel, where we now have the largest assortment of Klein Tools in home improvement retail. During the quarter, we were also pleased with the success of our CRAFTSMAN Days events, where we highlighted CRAFTSMAN products for multiple merchandising divisions with more than 100 products featured both in-store and online. As we look ahead to Q3 and the fall season, we have a strong product lineup ready for the fall, starting with Halloween. It's bigger than ever before with everything from new animatronics to inflatables along with fall cleaning and fall harvest and with the decor that can last the entire fall season. It is already available online and in-store. Shifting gears, we continue to deliver on our perpetual productivity improvement or our PPI initiatives. Our marketing team is rebranding our retail media network program to a simpler platform where we help our brand partners meet a wide range of marketing objectives from performance on shelf and new product launches to seasonal promotions and multiproduct sales. We're also pleased with the progress we've made working with our suppliers to take out costs that we absorbed over the last few years. We continue to work together with our suppliers to claw back these costs while also looking to reinvest into our marketing and merchandising strategies to drive traffic and sales. As I wrap up, I want to once again thank our supplier partners and our merchants for their partnership and hard work in bringing our customers the best brands, innovative products and compelling offers that offer value and new solutions for our customers' home improvement needs. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe McFarland: Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by recognizing our frontline associates. Their dedication to serving our customers is reflected in continued improvement in our customer satisfaction scores over last year. And while we continue to elevate the customer experience, we also managed staffing well in a dynamic environment and achieve greater payroll productivity. We achieved this improvement in customer service and productivity by continuing to shift associate time from non-customer-facing areas to focus on selling and assisting customers, which leads me to a question we often hear from our investors, namely, do our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI, initiatives negatively impact our customer experience? Let me address that head on. We found that the opposite is true. For a number of years now, we've been working smarter with tech-enabled solutions that make our associates more productive while enhancing customer service at the same time. The new In-Store Mode on our mobile app is a great example. When customers enter our store, they can enable In-Store Mode using the Lowes.com app on their phone, providing them with a detailed product and location information to help them navigate the store with ease. In addition to being a tremendous customer resource, In-Store Mode also helps free up associates so they can spend more time selling and focusing on customers who need help. And we're already working on the next innovations to the In-Store Mode to further streamline the shopping experience. Our PPI initiatives are also enabling us to reduce returns, which are now at historic lows for our company. There are a number of factors driving these results. Beginning with the returns desk, associates are using our modern omnichannel system, which makes the process as easy as a quick scan with the system immediately accounting for return policies. Second, we're collecting more precise information on why an item was returned so we can work together with our vendors to address any issues and prevent returns from happening in the first place. Third, we've identified key inflection points in our supply chain to reduce damages on more fragile items, like appliances, to better ensure that they arrive in pristine condition, therefore reducing returns. Even though we've already made substantial progress on our productivity journey, our team is already piloting some of the next round of innovations on our PPI roadmap. I'm looking forward to sharing more details about these initiatives at our Analyst and Investor Conference in December. Shifting gears now to Pro, where we continue to gain momentum with our core small- to mid-sized Pro customer as we delivered mid-single-digit positive Pro comps this quarter. The recent investments we've made in job site delivery and high velocity Pro SKUs are paying dividends, making it easier for us to fulfill larger orders and quickly replenish inventory within our store. And we're delivering outsized growth in Pro online sales as Pros appreciate the enhanced online shopping experience that we've created specifically for them. Looking ahead, we were pleased to hear from Pros on our recent survey that their backlogs remain healthy and consistent with last year. And what's also encouraging is that 75% of Pros are confident in landing new business. Our EVP of Pro and Home Services, Quonta Vance, will discuss the next phase of our Pro growth strategy at the December Analyst and Investor Conference. Before I wrap up, I want to thank our associates who contributed to our disaster relief efforts to help customers recover from storms, including Hurricanes Beryl and Debby. Lowe's command center, merchandising teams and supply chain teams went into action to pre-stage merchandise at key locations to be able to quickly respond to customers' needs both before and after the storms. I'd like to extend my appreciation to all of our associates for their tireless efforts to serve our communities in their time of need. And now, let me turn it over to Brandon.\nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with our Q2 results, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.17. In the quarter, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $43 million on deferred consideration associated with the 2022 sale of our Canadian retail business. Excluding this benefit, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.10. My comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons that exclude this benefit where applicable. Second quarter sales were $23.6 billion, with comparable sales down 5.1%. Comp sales were pressured by continued softness in DIY bigger-ticket projects, in line with our expectations. Also, unfavorable weather pressured sales in seasonal categories. Comparable average ticket was up 0.8%, helped by strength in Pro-heavy categories, as well as less average selling price pressure in appliances as we begin to cycle the normalization of promotions within the category. Comparable transactions declined 5.9%, with pressure from DIY project spend as well as lower seasonal transactions, partly offset by growth in Pro transactions. Our monthly comps were down 6.4% in May, 4.1% in June and 4.9% in July. Colder and wetter weather in May was quickly followed by intense heat across much of the country in June and July with both weather patterns pressuring outdoor spring activity. Gross margin was 33.5% in the second quarter, down 19 basis points from last year due to continuing supply chain investments, partly offset by lower transportation costs and ongoing PPI initiatives. Adjusted SG&A of 17.3% of sales delevered 87 basis points due to sales deleverage as well as the cycling of a favorable legal settlement. These impacts were partially offset by continued enterprise-wide PPI efforts and our quick pivot to manage expenses in line with sales that were adversely impacted by inconsistent weather trends. Adjusted operating margin rate of 14.4% declined 114 basis points. And the adjusted effective tax rate of 24.2% was in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $16.8 billion, down $581 million compared to Q2 of last year as we continue to align inventory levels with demand while also investing in high-velocity Pro items. Turning now to capital allocation. During the quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $1 billion and paid $629 million in dividends at $1.10 per share. We also announced a 5% increase to $1.15 per share for the dividend paid on August 7. Capital expenditures totaled $426 million as we continue to invest in modernizing our technology infrastructure and our strategic growth priorities. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR finished the quarter at 3.03 times, and we delivered a return on invested capital above 30%. Now, turning to our financial outlook. Sales in the first half of the year performed largely in line with our expectations. But as Marvin mentioned, the home improvement backdrop remains challenging and consumer sentiment remains weak. Based on these factors, we are updating our full year 2024 outlook. We are now expecting sales in the range of $82.7 billion to $83.2 billion, with comparable sales in a range of down 3.5% to down 4%. We also now expect full year adjusted operating margin in a range of 12.4% to 12.5% as we continue to tightly manage expenses while also investing in our strategic priorities. Additionally, we expect full year net interest expense of approximately $1.4 billion and to repay a $450 million bond maturity in September. We also expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion and an adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5%. This results in an updated outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $11.70 to $11.90. Now to assist you with your modeling, here are a few points to consider for the back half of the year. We are expecting third and fourth quarter comp sales to be roughly 200 basis points better than our second quarter results, given the easier prior-year compares. And we also expect operating margin rate for the second half to be roughly in line with prior year, with Q3 approximately 70 basis points below prior-year rate and Q4 to be approximately 50 basis points above prior-year rate. The quarterly differences are driven by the timing of merchandising PPI initiatives as we turn through our inventory, as well as comparisons to prior-year incentive compensation expense and year-end discretionary bonuses. And finally, we are reconfirming our capital allocation priorities. We will continue to invest in the business to drive long-term growth while maintaining a 35% targeted dividend payout ratio and then use the remaining cash flows to fund share repurchases. This disciplined approach to capital allocation combined with improved operating performance almost tripled ROIC over the past five years. In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute at a high level as we navigate these near-term market uncertainties while making the right investments in our Total Home strategy all while continuing to drive sustainable shareholder value. And with that, we will open it up for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We are now ready for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. I have one question about top-line and then second about margin. So, the first question on the spread between DIY and Pro. I don't think we have that for every quarter, but call it, 15-point spread, it looks like the highest number in a long time, if that's fair. And it would imply you're taking share in Pro, but it looks like you're losing some in DIY. Is that fair? And then, if you look across geographies, how does the spread vary? Is it a function of the Pro spread? Is it a function of DIY? And then, what's causing that spread to vary, if so? Thanks.\nMarvin Ellison: Simeon, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of that. I think what's difficult for us to determine in home improvement is where you're actually losing or gaining share specifically in the categories of DIY and Pro. I get the foundation of your question, but one thing we can confirm for sure is that our Pro business is growing, so we do believe that we're taking share just based on the maturation of the strategic initiatives that you heard from me, Joe and Bill. As we look at the DIY, the best way for me to explain and answer the question is our sales are much more concentrated in bigger-ticket DIY discretionary purchases. And when you look at big-ticket discretionary projects in the second quarter, the DIY demand was softest in those categories and in those projects. As you mentioned, we're still roughly approximately 75% DIY. So, any pullback in these big-ticket discretionary categories is really more of a disproportionate impact to us. So, I don't know that we're losing share in DIY as much as the dynamic of these big discretionary projects in the quarter affected us. And that's really the way we're looking at it. Now here's the good news. The good news is we feel great about our assortment from a merchandising perspective. We feel great about our pricing, our execution, our marketing. And we believe this is just a macro issue that we're dealing with relative to DIY big-ticket discretionary. So, when we look at Q2, even though it was a challenging economic environment, we feel great that we could grow mid-single-digit positive comp in Pro, we could deliver almost 3% growth online, and we're still managing through macro headwinds with DIY discretionary spend. So, we believe that when the DIY market inflect at some point in the future, we're in a perfect position to take overall market share in home improvement because of the strength we're seeing in Pro and online. So with that, I'll let Brandon take the second part of the question.\nBrandon Sink: Yeah, Simeon, your question on geographic differences, really pretty consistent. Marvin mentioned the growth in Pro, that's driven by both transactions and ticket. But when we look across our geographic divisions, very consistent performance and taking share regionally consistently there. And then, on the DIY side, again, too, really no notable geographic differences outside of the hurricane impact that we saw around the July timeframe with Hurricane Beryl coming through the Houston geography. But other than that, really consistent.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And then, my follow-up on margin, it looks like in the second half, the conversion or the relationship between the comp and the margin, it looks a little weaker than maybe the first half. It doesn't look terrible given the comp, but it looks a little weaker. So, I want to ask if that's because of anything that Lowe's is doing differently, how you're managing your business, how you're making investments, or is it simply a function of those things? Brandon, you mentioned some of the lapse of incentive comp, and I think there was one other thing. So, is it internal or external?\nBrandon Sink: Yeah, Simeon, it's really the latter. The updated full year operating margin outlook is very consistent when you look at it annually with our rule of thumb, 14 basis points of contraction on the downside for every point of comp decline. And as you mentioned, second half quarterly differences are driven mainly by the timing of the merch PPI initiatives as we turn through the callbacks and then what we're cycling over as it relates to prior-year incentive compensation. We called out last year $140 million of frontline bonuses that we paid in Q4. So, it's really a function of those two things. Gross margins for the year, as we've said consistently, we expect roughly flat for the full year, and that's what's embedded in the operating margin outlook.\nSimeon Gutman: Perfect. Thanks. Good luck.\nBrandon Sink: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nSteven Zaccone: Hey, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on just understanding the guidance cut as well, because it seems like the Pro business is kind of outperforming expectations. So, if you have to dig a little deeper into the DIY side of the business, maybe parse through some of the categories on home decor and hardlines, what's really the biggest change to your outlook? And given the fact that sales have been coming in a little bit weaker than expected for longer, does that temper your view on a potential recovery in DIY demand?\nMarvin Ellison: So, Steven, thank you for the question. I'll take the first part of it. Look, I think for us, when we think about our guidance change for the year, it really comes down to just being prudent and being cautious based on the macro environment and the overall customer sentiment specifically around big-ticket DIY discretionary spend. We're all aware that we have an environment of elevated interest rates and inflation. And because of that, the DIY customer is just on the sidelines, waiting for some form of an inflection to take place. So, we can't call when that's going to happen, but we felt based on what we saw in the second quarter that it was prudent just to take a cautious approach to our guidance for the second half. And really, that's what we decided to do. I'll let Brandon take the rest of your question.\nBrandon Sink: Yeah, Steven, this is Brandon. Just a little more context on the guide. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, first half really largely in line with our expectations when you exclude the weather impacts that we experienced. And as we looked into the second half, just as Marvin just said, we still continue to see a very cautious consumer home improvement backdrop that remains challenged. And for those reasons, we decided to make an adjustment to the guide, and it does capture ongoing both DIY and Pro trends. And we're continuing to manage through the DIY challenges in the big-ticket discretionary, but we are still seeing strength, especially in the small to medium Pro, and that's reflected. Just as a reminder, we're cycling a pretty big DIY pullback, which started in Q3 of last year, again, as it relates to the big-ticket discretionary. So, the breakdown as it relates to comp, we are expecting, just like we've seen here in the first half, roughly flat average ticket in the second half as the Pro growth is offsetting some appliance pricing pressure that we're seeing. And then, we expect to see the transactions as the offset. That's where the pressure is at, and we continue to expect that to be challenged as the homeowners less engaged with home improvement activity in the second half. So that's a little bit more of a breakdown as it relates to second half guide.\nSteven Zaccone: That's helpful. Thanks for that extra color. I have a brief follow-up just on pricing. There's been focus on pricing and the risk of promotions impacting the industry if demand stays weak. You actually saw ticket growth in the quarter, but do you see that as a risk at all, just pricing and promotions kind of trickling into the industry if demand stays weak?\nBill Boltz: Yes, Steven, this is Bill. So, we actually see our -- the promotional activity remaining relatively stable. When you get around certain events, Memorial Day, July 4, et cetera, you've got offers that are out there that are seasonally relevant. And we try to make sure that we're out there meeting the consumer at that time as well. And so, when you look at Q3, we've got Labor Day in front of us. So, we're going to be out there making sure that we've got seasonally relevant offers that are out there for that time as we shift gears into the fall season. But from a promotional activity, we're relatively stable. And we're seeing on the appliance side that we're back to more of a normal activity as it relates to how the appliance industry is going to market. So, nothing really out of the norm.\nBrandon Sink: And Steven, this is Brandon. I would just reinforce that the ticket increase is not a function of pricing so much as it's just the strength that we're seeing in the Pro business, which is lifting ticket, and then, as Bill mentioned, the cycling of the promo environment in appliances. Broadly speaking, as it relates to pricing environment, really largely stable here over the last couple of years. There's always pockets of activity that we see, but the ticket has been -- and the pricing environment has been largely consistent since 2022. And the industry continues to be disciplined and rational. So, for those reasons, we expect the ticket to continue to hold as we look across the second half of the year.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Thanks for the detail. Best of luck in the second half.\nBrandon Sink: Thanks, Steven.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks, and good morning. So first, a clarification. To confirm, you expect 3Q and 4Q comps to be basically the same or sequentially improving over the year? Related to that, how much do you think weather actually was a headwind to comp in the second quarter? And any comment on where you are trending quarter-to-date relative to the updated expectations?\nBrandon Sink: So, Chris, first part of your question, the comps are relatively evenly split when you look at Q3 and Q4 as it relates to what's embedded in the guide. And then, the question on weather impact, and in particular, as it impacted our DIY seasonal business, so we did see unfavorable weather in Q2. It pressured sales, cold and wet weather in May, followed by the intense heat that we saw in June and July. Just as a reminder, we are cycling over a strong seasonal performance last year Q2. We saw that especially in live goods and smaller outdoor projects. And outside of just seasonal, the intense weather also impacted other outdoor, call it, non-seasonal projects like exterior paint and decking. And then, the last thing I'll call out, we did see pressure in big-ticket discretionary seasonal categories like patio and grills, but that was largely expected as we've been managing those seasonal buys down to more recent trends that we've seen. So that was the pressure. That was mainly where we saw the deceleration in comps from -- as we moved from June to July. And then, I would say, as it relates to your question on August, very much playing out through here the first two-plus weeks very much in line with what we've guided to Q3.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then, in terms of the gross margin outlook, so it would seem like you're basically expecting gross margin to be down again perhaps more significantly in the third quarter as we -- is that fair? And then, as you think about the flow of the vendor clawbacks, this would imply that really the clawbacks are starting in the fourth quarter and then will sort of continue in the first half of 2025. Thanks very much.\nBrandon Sink: Yeah, Chris. So, not down. We are expecting it to be up both in Q3 and Q4 of this year, but again, on the year, roughly flat. And I'll mention just a couple of the pushes and pulls. We continue to make the supply chain investments nearly complete with the rollout of market delivery, investments we're making in early innings on Pro fulfillment, and then, as you mentioned, the merchant supply chain PPI initiatives. The clawback is going to continue to benefit. And it really starts to accelerate in Q3, Q4. And as you mentioned, turning into '25, there's a lagged effect there just with how that turns through inventory. Transportation cost continues to be a good guy for us as we leverage our scale. And then, credit and shrink, expect those to be roughly flat for the full year, and a great job by the teams managing pressures in those two lines. So, you're seeing that largely those things played out here in Q2 with the progression that we saw nicely from Q1 to Q2. And those same things roughly play out for the full year.\nChristopher Horvers: Thank you. Have a great Labor Day.\nBrandon Sink: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. I guess a high-level question on your earnings algo. This will be basically the third year of negative comps. I guess, theoretically, if comps were to stay negative in '25, is there a point where deleverage actually accelerates because of the fixed cost nature of your model?\nBrandon Sink: Yeah. I would say, Scot, we expect our kind of rule of thumb in the algorithm. We expect that, that still holds. And it's directional, and it applies mainly to the fiscal year. We still see plus 10 basis points on the upside for every incremental point of comp and then 15 basis points on the downside. That's what's reflected in our full year guide. And we're working really hard to kind of stay consistent with that. It's not a natural output with all the work we've been doing across the portfolio with PPI. And then, you referenced our overall roadmap. We'll talk more about 2025 in December, but really the framework still holds. Everything we've been driving from a PPI standpoint, offsetting investments we're making in gross margin. On the SG&A side, same thing, investing or offsetting investments that we're making in wages, inflationary pressures, strategic investments. And it really comes down to the fixed cost leverage and our ability to grow top-line, but when we do that, we believe we stay consistent with that framework, and we can see the expansion.\nScot Ciccarelli: Helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. Did additional changes to incentive comp had a significant impact on second quarter and your back half outlook? In other words, is that something we have to kind of consider as we think about '25 earnings outlook?\nBrandon Sink: Very consistent. The only thing from an incentive compensation standpoint is what I referred to with the noise in Q4 on the $140 million discretionary payout in Q4, but largely consistent there. Nothing that would need to change or be factored in.\nScot Ciccarelli: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: Our next questions are from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We were wondering if you could speak to how you're managing your inventory levels. I know inventory was down on a dollar basis in the quarter, but how are you thinking about inventory in the context of maybe a slightly more cautious demand environment in the second half as well as possibly having to manage a higher ocean freight environment?\nBrandon Sink: Yeah, Kate, really pleased with the ability of the team to manage inventory. We continue to manage it with the sales trends that we're seeing, as inventory declined faster than sales, inventories down 3.3% year-over-year. We remain focused on making the investments in Pro depth and brands to support and accelerate the Pro growth that we've talked about. We feel like we're in a great position on in-stock levels. And then, from a seasonal inventory standpoint, also in a good spot as we've managed the seasonal bias to the trends we're seeing. And I think you also mentioned freight rates. From a transportation standpoint, we continue to see lower transportation costs as we've leveraged our sale to drive the lower rates that we've seen with our carriers, mostly insulated from that because we have contract pricing. And we see those favorable rates kind of extending through the first part of 2025. So, we expect the favorability that we've seen in Q2 to kind of extend through the remainder of the year, and that's baked in our gross margin guide.\nMarvin Ellison: And Kate, this is Marvin. One thing we don't talk a lot about is how we've converted our regional distribution centers to be more of a flow-through of product versus stocking a product. If you go back to six years ago, these RDCs were basically the traditional hub-and-spoke distribution centers that basically held and stored inventory and replenished stores. And that really put a lot of pressure on turns and overall inventory position. But over the years, the team has converted that to being majority flow. So, we're just becoming more of a cross-dock type of environment, and we have a very small percent of the inventory being stocked. That will continue to evolve over time. And as Brandon noted, we continue to make investments and finalize our build-out of our market delivery. That also puts us in a great position to continue to be the industry leader in appliances without having to hold that inventory the way we did years ago in the back of every store. So, there are cost of things that we're working on that's going to give us the ability to improve our insight position, but also improve our turns at the same time.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nRobby Ohmes: Thanks for taking my question. Really just two quick questions. Just on the back half and just going forward from here, the PPI initiatives have been amazing on the expense side. How much room is left? At what point do you get to diminishing returns on that in terms of managing expenses? And when we look at the back half, is it really more incentive comp and bonus comparisons that support SG&A being lower than it might otherwise be versus PPI initiatives?\nBrandon Sink: Robby, this is Brandon. So, you mentioned PPI, we're really proud of the progress that we've made with PPI and broader expense management. We're offsetting over $500 million in associate wages, inflationary pressures and strategic investments that we're making here. In 2024, the roadmap covers all aspects of the company stores, merchandising, supply chain, technology, our back-office expense infrastructure. You heard Joe and Bill kind of reference a number of things going on there. And I would say we have great alignment across the organization to continue to maintain that discipline. And as Joe mentioned, increasingly able to enhance our customer experience while also driving productivity with tech-driven solutions. So, I'll toss to Marvin. Anything else you want to add there?\nMarvin Ellison: Yeah. I'm going to just let Joe and Bill talk a little bit about PPI. To Brandon's point, I mean, we are incredibly pleased with the progress that we've made. Initially, our productivity improvement initiatives were focused almost exclusively on store operations. And now, we've created a culture where every functional area is driving their own PPI initiatives to not only drive improvements in the business and productivity, but also just driving overall efficiencies. So, I'm going to let Joe talk a bit about operations, and then Bill will talk about merchandising and what we're going to be seeing not only in the back half of the year, but going forward. So, Joe, we'll start with you.\nJoe McFarland: Robby, thanks for the question. And while we've made a lot of progress, we're only in the middle innings of the productivity journey, a lot of runway still in front of us. I've talked about things in the past, front-end transformation. We're not even 50% through our front-end transformation. This is not only focused on the operations side, but also the sales side. And so, we worked hand-in-hand. Things like our activity-based labor model that we continue to invest in, we've continued to refine the advanced labor management tools that we're using today. And also, the MST program that has added 30,000-plus associates to the sales force. And so, as the teams continue to work together, we continue to see a lot of runway ahead, streamlining the back-end processes are still in front of us and a lot more to go. And so, I'll toss it over to Bill for...\nBill Boltz: Yeah. Thanks, Joe. Robby, on the merch side, I hit a couple of them in my prepared remarks. We're working on costs with suppliers as an ongoing process, and the merchants do that on a daily basis through product line reviews, business reviews. But assortment productivity is part of what we do on a weekly basis and making sure that we've got the right stuff in the stores and online. I hit on retail media network, that's part of what we're doing as well, making sure that working with our vendor partners to look at different options in regards to how we put marketing strategies together, our private brand work that we've been doing over the last six years to focus on opportunities of where we can put private brands into our assortments. Those opportunities to put those products into our assortment typically come with a higher margin. And so, that offers that opportunity to put a better performing product in the assortment. So, those are just a few examples on the merch side.\nRobby Ohmes: That sounds great. Thanks so much guys.\nMarvin Ellison: Thanks, Robby.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Bellinger: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So again, good continued progress on the Pro, up mid-single digits. What's the next iteration for your Pro customer? Are there additional levers we can see take shape, maybe more brands, loyalty, working upstream with somewhat larger Pros? And does Lowe's do anything today in terms of trade credit with the Pro customer base?\nMarvin Ellison: Hey, David, thank you for the question. I think, first, if we could take a step back and think about what we've done thus far, and one of the things that we identified from the very beginning of this transformation was the fact that we needed a very consistent and coherent approach to how we serve the core customer. And really it started with service levels in the store because regardless of what level of fulfillment and fulfillment capabilities you have in home improvement, your stores will still be an incredibly important part of the fill-in project nature need for the Pro customer. And so, our service levels were subpar at best. And so, Joe and team have done an incredible job of elevating those standards. And then, we had to get our product assortment right. We had customers who no longer shopped with us because there were brands that they were loyal to that literally had stopped selling to Lowe's. And so, Bill and his team has done an equally incredible job of bringing those brands back to us. Bill noted in his prepared comments just the success of our relationship with Klein Tools. And Klein was one of those customers that when we arrived was no longer doing business with Lowe's. And it remains the number one brand for electrical and HVAC Pros. And then, we have to get committed to our inventory levels. We talk a lot about job lot quantities, but we had to do that in a way that we gave Pros confidence and also in a way that we would not leave our stores vulnerable for large purchases that we could replenish quickly. And so, after we established those foundational things, we knew that the next step was creating stickiness where you would give those customers a reason to shop us versus the competition. We rolled out our loyalty program a little over a year ago. And then, we rolled out a more sophisticated CRM platform. And now, we're continuing to build on all of those things with more job site fulfillment. And so, Quonta Vance, our EVP of Pro and Home Services, at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference is going to lay out our long-term vision of where we plan to take Pro. And that's going to have a lot to do with identifying segments of Pro that we are barely scratching the surface today from a share standpoint that we're going to start to pursue in addition to ways we're going to enhance fulfillment and how we're going to be able to bring a more digitally friendly relationship with Pros so they could have a large selection of product choices and do it in a more seamless nature. We're incredibly excited about our Pro customer. And as I said earlier, we believe strongly that the pressure that we're feeling with the discretionary big-ticket DIY is in large part a macro influence issue. And so, as we now have momentum with the Pro, momentum with our digital strategy, we believe that when the marketplace inflects and the DIY customer starts to have a stronger confidence in making those discretionary purchases that we're going to have the full flywheel effect of our market share gains. In the meantime, we're going to be incredibly disciplined on these key parts of our business, but we're very excited about what we're doing in Pro but more importantly, what we're going to be doing in the future.\nDavid Bellinger: Thanks, Marvin. That's very helpful. And then, I also want to ask on the rural store performance. I'm not sure if you called that out in the prepared remarks. Just any change in trend there? And then secondly, there's been some mention of faster delivery times, one-day, two-day shipping to those markets from a major e-commerce player. How should we think about any potential impact for the more rural Lowe's store base, just given that development?\nMarvin Ellison: Well, the great thing about our gig network and the work that we've done online is that we're serving all customers and giving them ability to get same-day, next-day fulfillment across all of our partners. We feel really good about what's happening in our rural markets. They performed to our expectations. We are piloting a lot of unique and different initiatives in some of these stores. And you could argue that we're pressure testing some of these locations to see what works and what does not work. One thing I will tell you is that we're still very excited about what we're doing with our workwear initiative, specifically with Carhartt. We're excited with what we're seeing with our pet food and pet initiative overall, and what we're seeing with just the ATV and other activities our rural customers participate in. But we're pleased with our rural performance. We're pleased that we're able to take this digital gig platform and serve customers in both urban, suburban and rural areas. And we're just continuing to build on that. And we'll provide more context when we get together in December, but we think rural is going to be a significant part of our growth strategy.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. If we assume the Fed starts easing in the next couple of months, what level of rate cut or rate level do you think is the right level to start stimulating demand in the category again? And is there anything in your history that would suggest a faster recovery one way or the other in Pro or DIY side?\nBrandon Sink: Zach, this is Brandon. As it relates to the interest rate environment, so for us, it's difficult to know at what absolute interest rate level we're going to see our consumers fully engage or how long the demand will lag the actual rate cuts that we're seeing. We absolutely, as we sit here today, see pent-up demand in the business, but on the flip side, when we look at consumer sentiment, that continues to remain weak. We are hopeful that the lower rates, the drops that we're seeing, are going to have a dual impact of, one, relieving pressure on consumers, and then secondly, driving the existing home sales activity. But the reality is when we look at the lock-in effect, the majority of homeowners are still at 4%. Mortgage rates are less. So, even if we do see some level of decrease that we do believe there still may be a reluctance to engage. So, we're staying close to it beyond the rates. Marvin reiterated the primary drivers of our business, and that's been consistent. So, we're balancing rate activity with some broader recovery that we see across some of these other metrics that we track very closely.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And -- thanks, Brandon. And I don't want to front-run the Analyst Day too much, but you have talked about a long-term margin for this business of about 14.5%. Given where we are today and the changes that have occurred since you first provided that outlook, curious if it's still the right way to think about the business long term. And what level of top-line and near-term recovery do you think we need to see to reach that level?\nBrandon Sink: Yeah. We'll hold off on getting too much into that detail. I think the punchline, Zach, is the framework still holds. It is -- as we look relative to what we talked about in December of '22, I think the degree of step back now that we've seen in '23 and now that what we're seeing in '24 is a little bit worse than our original expectations. But we're not going to call the turn or the inflection point. We do believe there's a lot of pent-up demand. We do have a lot of confidence in the medium- to long-term drivers. When we do get back to kind of that mid-single-digit recovery in comp that we've traditionally seen in home improvement, we believe we can outpace that with the initiatives that we have in place. And the degree and the timing of the expansion on operating margin, again, is going to be contingent on the pace in which that top-line recovers.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nBrandon Sink: Yeah. Rob, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our final question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question, I guess a bit of a follow-up to that -- the prior question was on rate. So, I'm going to go to a different direction. I mean, look, I think you as an operator, we as investors, are waiting for a more accommodative rate environment to underpin better demand within home improvement. So, the question is, as you look at your business, we've seen this malaise continuing to take hold, maybe even intensify over the past several quarters. Where are the incremental risks? Where could the business actually get weaker here before we get that rate relief, if you will?\nBrandon Sink: Brian, this is Brandon. Look, mortgage rates, obviously, coming down. We expect that to continue to come down further as we turn into '25, but we look at consumer sentiment, existing home sales, housing affordability, those are still concerns. We continue to see pressure there. Consumers are still showing a preference for services versus goods, especially in home improvement. An improvement in these macro trends, we should see and drive sustained increase in discretionary projects in DIY traffic. So, particularly, in the bigger-ticket categories, which is what we're watching for, that's the inflection that we expect. But in terms of the timing and our ability to call that, that's what's unclear to us at this point.\nMarvin Ellison: So Brian, this is Marvin. I'll take another angle at your question. And so for us, obviously, we don't have a crystal ball to call the inflection when that will happen nor to Brandon's earlier comments, can we pinpoint what rate environment we have to be in before it starts to positively inflect this DIY discretionary pullback for big ticket. But what we're trying to do is in this headwind environment that we're in is just continuing to leverage our great balance sheet, to invest in technology and innovation, to make sure we continue to execute our Total Home strategy, which is allowing us to pick up share in Pro, improve our online business, continue to build out a technology platform for our home installation business, which was incredibly neglected from a technology standpoint for many, many years, because we know that when the inflection happens and the DIY return, we want to be perfectly positioned to really take share, not just in DIY, but also across all the other elements that I talked about. So, rather than sitting back and waiting, we're aggressively working in this downturn leveraging our balance sheet to do these aggressive investments and position ourselves. So, when it happens, whenever the macro inflection occurs, we just want to be ready to take advantage of it, and we think we will be. And so, we're just fortunate that we have the ability to continue to be aggressive in all of those areas and just preparing for the eventual time when the market will open back up again, and we're going to be prepared when it does.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And my quick follow-up, I guess this is more for you, Brandon, but just with respect to the commentary around Q3, so the comps in Q2 were down, call it, 5%. You talked about a 200 basis point improvement. So -- and I think in response to someone else's question, you said you're basically [right there now] (ph). So, does that mean the business is running at a negative 3%? Is that the math?\nMarvin Ellison: So look, I will rescue Brandon from that question and answer for him. We tend not to be that precise with current monthly trends. The best way for me and us to answer that question, Brian, and I appreciate the question, is when we look at our current business trends, they are reflective of guidance we gave, understanding that our business will fluctuate throughout the quarter. And so, we're not going to give a specific comp percent other than to say we feel confident that our current trends reflect the guidance we gave. And I think that's probably the best efficient way to ask it.\nBrian Nagel: Appreciate it. Thanks, Marvin. Thank you.\nMarvin Ellison: No, thanks for the question.\nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.\nOperator: This concludes the Lowe's second quarter 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with our Q2 results, we generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.17. In the quarter, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $43 million on deferred consideration associated with the 2022 sale of our Canadian retail business. Excluding this benefit, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.10. My comments from this point forward will include certain non-GAAP comparisons that exclude this benefit where applicable. Second quarter sales were $23.6 billion, with comparable sales down 5.1%. Comp sales were pressured by continued softness in DIY bigger-ticket projects, in line with our expectations. Also, unfavorable weather pressured sales in seasonal categories. Comparable average ticket was up 0.8%, helped by strength in Pro-heavy categories, as well as less average selling price pressure in appliances as we begin to cycle the normalization of promotions within the category. Comparable transactions declined 5.9%, with pressure from DIY project spend as well as lower seasonal transactions, partly offset by growth in Pro transactions. Our monthly comps were down 6.4% in May, 4.1% in June and 4.9% in July. Colder and wetter weather in May was quickly followed by intense heat across much of the country in June and July with both weather patterns pressuring outdoor spring activity. Gross margin was 33.5% in the second quarter, down 19 basis points from last year due to continuing supply chain investments, partly offset by lower transportation costs and ongoing PPI initiatives. Adjusted SG&A of 17.3% of sales delevered 87 basis points due to sales deleverage as well as the cycling of a favorable legal settlement. These impacts were partially offset by continued enterprise-wide PPI efforts and our quick pivot to manage expenses in line with sales that were adversely impacted by inconsistent weather trends. Adjusted operating margin rate of 14.4% declined 114 basis points. And the adjusted effective tax rate of 24.2% was in line with prior year. Inventory ended the quarter at $16.8 billion, down $581 million compared to Q2 of last year as we continue to align inventory levels with demand while also investing in high-velocity Pro items. Turning now to capital allocation. During the quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $1 billion and paid $629 million in dividends at $1.10 per share. We also announced a 5% increase to $1.15 per share for the dividend paid on August 7. Capital expenditures totaled $426 million as we continue to invest in modernizing our technology infrastructure and our strategic growth priorities. Adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR finished the quarter at 3.03 times, and we delivered a return on invested capital above 30%. Now, turning to our financial outlook. Sales in the first half of the year performed largely in line with our expectations. But as Marvin mentioned, the home improvement backdrop remains challenging and consumer sentiment remains weak. Based on these factors, we are updating our full year 2024 outlook. We are now expecting sales in the range of $82.7 billion to $83.2 billion, with comparable sales in a range of down 3.5% to down 4%. We also now expect full year adjusted operating margin in a range of 12.4% to 12.5% as we continue to tightly manage expenses while also investing in our strategic priorities. Additionally, we expect full year net interest expense of approximately $1.4 billion and to repay a $450 million bond maturity in September. We also expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion and an adjusted effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5%. This results in an updated outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $11.70 to $11.90. Now to assist you with your modeling, here are a few points to consider for the back half of the year. We are expecting third and fourth quarter comp sales to be roughly 200 basis points better than our second quarter results, given the easier prior-year compares. And we also expect operating margin rate for the second half to be roughly in line with prior year, with Q3 approximately 70 basis points below prior-year rate and Q4 to be approximately 50 basis points above prior-year rate. The quarterly differences are driven by the timing of merchandising PPI initiatives as we turn through our inventory, as well as comparisons to prior-year incentive compensation expense and year-end discretionary bonuses. And finally, we are reconfirming our capital allocation priorities. We will continue to invest in the business to drive long-term growth while maintaining a 35% targeted dividend payout ratio and then use the remaining cash flows to fund share repurchases. This disciplined approach to capital allocation combined with improved operating performance almost tripled ROIC over the past five years. In closing, we are confident in our ability to execute at a high level as we navigate these near-term market uncertainties while making the right investments in our Total Home strategy all while continuing to drive sustainable shareholder value. And with that, we will open it up for your questions. Yeah, Simeon, your question on geographic differences, really pretty consistent. Marvin mentioned the growth in Pro, that's driven by both transactions and ticket. But when we look across our geographic divisions, very consistent performance and taking share regionally consistently there. And then, on the DIY side, again, too, really no notable geographic differences outside of the hurricane impact that we saw around the July timeframe with Hurricane Beryl coming through the Houston geography. But other than that, really consistent. Yeah, Simeon, it's really the latter. The updated full year operating margin outlook is very consistent when you look at it annually with our rule of thumb, 14 basis points of contraction on the downside for every point of comp decline. And as you mentioned, second half quarterly differences are driven mainly by the timing of the merch PPI initiatives as we turn through the callbacks and then what we're cycling over as it relates to prior-year incentive compensation. We called out last year $140 million of frontline bonuses that we paid in Q4. So, it's really a function of those two things. Gross margins for the year, as we've said consistently, we expect roughly flat for the full year, and that's what's embedded in the operating margin outlook. Thank you. Yeah, Steven, this is Brandon. Just a little more context on the guide. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, first half really largely in line with our expectations when you exclude the weather impacts that we experienced. And as we looked into the second half, just as Marvin just said, we still continue to see a very cautious consumer home improvement backdrop that remains challenged. And for those reasons, we decided to make an adjustment to the guide, and it does capture ongoing both DIY and Pro trends. And we're continuing to manage through the DIY challenges in the big-ticket discretionary, but we are still seeing strength, especially in the small to medium Pro, and that's reflected. Just as a reminder, we're cycling a pretty big DIY pullback, which started in Q3 of last year, again, as it relates to the big-ticket discretionary. So, the breakdown as it relates to comp, we are expecting, just like we've seen here in the first half, roughly flat average ticket in the second half as the Pro growth is offsetting some appliance pricing pressure that we're seeing. And then, we expect to see the transactions as the offset. That's where the pressure is at, and we continue to expect that to be challenged as the homeowners less engaged with home improvement activity in the second half. So that's a little bit more of a breakdown as it relates to second half guide. And Steven, this is Brandon. I would just reinforce that the ticket increase is not a function of pricing so much as it's just the strength that we're seeing in the Pro business, which is lifting ticket, and then, as Bill mentioned, the cycling of the promo environment in appliances. Broadly speaking, as it relates to pricing environment, really largely stable here over the last couple of years. There's always pockets of activity that we see, but the ticket has been -- and the pricing environment has been largely consistent since 2022. And the industry continues to be disciplined and rational. So, for those reasons, we expect the ticket to continue to hold as we look across the second half of the year. Thanks, Steven. So, Chris, first part of your question, the comps are relatively evenly split when you look at Q3 and Q4 as it relates to what's embedded in the guide. And then, the question on weather impact, and in particular, as it impacted our DIY seasonal business, so we did see unfavorable weather in Q2. It pressured sales, cold and wet weather in May, followed by the intense heat that we saw in June and July. Just as a reminder, we are cycling over a strong seasonal performance last year Q2. We saw that especially in live goods and smaller outdoor projects. And outside of just seasonal, the intense weather also impacted other outdoor, call it, non-seasonal projects like exterior paint and decking. And then, the last thing I'll call out, we did see pressure in big-ticket discretionary seasonal categories like patio and grills, but that was largely expected as we've been managing those seasonal buys down to more recent trends that we've seen. So that was the pressure. That was mainly where we saw the deceleration in comps from -- as we moved from June to July. And then, I would say, as it relates to your question on August, very much playing out through here the first two-plus weeks very much in line with what we've guided to Q3. Yeah, Chris. So, not down. We are expecting it to be up both in Q3 and Q4 of this year, but again, on the year, roughly flat. And I'll mention just a couple of the pushes and pulls. We continue to make the supply chain investments nearly complete with the rollout of market delivery, investments we're making in early innings on Pro fulfillment, and then, as you mentioned, the merchant supply chain PPI initiatives. The clawback is going to continue to benefit. And it really starts to accelerate in Q3, Q4. And as you mentioned, turning into '25, there's a lagged effect there just with how that turns through inventory. Transportation cost continues to be a good guy for us as we leverage our scale. And then, credit and shrink, expect those to be roughly flat for the full year, and a great job by the teams managing pressures in those two lines. So, you're seeing that largely those things played out here in Q2 with the progression that we saw nicely from Q1 to Q2. And those same things roughly play out for the full year. Thanks, Chris. Yeah. I would say, Scot, we expect our kind of rule of thumb in the algorithm. We expect that, that still holds. And it's directional, and it applies mainly to the fiscal year. We still see plus 10 basis points on the upside for every incremental point of comp and then 15 basis points on the downside. That's what's reflected in our full year guide. And we're working really hard to kind of stay consistent with that. It's not a natural output with all the work we've been doing across the portfolio with PPI. And then, you referenced our overall roadmap. We'll talk more about 2025 in December, but really the framework still holds. Everything we've been driving from a PPI standpoint, offsetting investments we're making in gross margin. On the SG&A side, same thing, investing or offsetting investments that we're making in wages, inflationary pressures, strategic investments. And it really comes down to the fixed cost leverage and our ability to grow top-line, but when we do that, we believe we stay consistent with that framework, and we can see the expansion. Very consistent. The only thing from an incentive compensation standpoint is what I referred to with the noise in Q4 on the $140 million discretionary payout in Q4, but largely consistent there. Nothing that would need to change or be factored in. Yeah, Kate, really pleased with the ability of the team to manage inventory. We continue to manage it with the sales trends that we're seeing, as inventory declined faster than sales, inventories down 3.3% year-over-year. We remain focused on making the investments in Pro depth and brands to support and accelerate the Pro growth that we've talked about. We feel like we're in a great position on in-stock levels. And then, from a seasonal inventory standpoint, also in a good spot as we've managed the seasonal bias to the trends we're seeing. And I think you also mentioned freight rates. From a transportation standpoint, we continue to see lower transportation costs as we've leveraged our sale to drive the lower rates that we've seen with our carriers, mostly insulated from that because we have contract pricing. And we see those favorable rates kind of extending through the first part of 2025. So, we expect the favorability that we've seen in Q2 to kind of extend through the remainder of the year, and that's baked in our gross margin guide. Robby, this is Brandon. So, you mentioned PPI, we're really proud of the progress that we've made with PPI and broader expense management. We're offsetting over $500 million in associate wages, inflationary pressures and strategic investments that we're making here. In 2024, the roadmap covers all aspects of the company stores, merchandising, supply chain, technology, our back-office expense infrastructure. You heard Joe and Bill kind of reference a number of things going on there. And I would say we have great alignment across the organization to continue to maintain that discipline. And as Joe mentioned, increasingly able to enhance our customer experience while also driving productivity with tech-driven solutions. So, I'll toss to Marvin. Anything else you want to add there? Zach, this is Brandon. As it relates to the interest rate environment, so for us, it's difficult to know at what absolute interest rate level we're going to see our consumers fully engage or how long the demand will lag the actual rate cuts that we're seeing. We absolutely, as we sit here today, see pent-up demand in the business, but on the flip side, when we look at consumer sentiment, that continues to remain weak. We are hopeful that the lower rates, the drops that we're seeing, are going to have a dual impact of, one, relieving pressure on consumers, and then secondly, driving the existing home sales activity. But the reality is when we look at the lock-in effect, the majority of homeowners are still at 4%. Mortgage rates are less. So, even if we do see some level of decrease that we do believe there still may be a reluctance to engage. So, we're staying close to it beyond the rates. Marvin reiterated the primary drivers of our business, and that's been consistent. So, we're balancing rate activity with some broader recovery that we see across some of these other metrics that we track very closely. Yeah. We'll hold off on getting too much into that detail. I think the punchline, Zach, is the framework still holds. It is -- as we look relative to what we talked about in December of '22, I think the degree of step back now that we've seen in '23 and now that what we're seeing in '24 is a little bit worse than our original expectations. But we're not going to call the turn or the inflection point. We do believe there's a lot of pent-up demand. We do have a lot of confidence in the medium- to long-term drivers. When we do get back to kind of that mid-single-digit recovery in comp that we've traditionally seen in home improvement, we believe we can outpace that with the initiatives that we have in place. And the degree and the timing of the expansion on operating margin, again, is going to be contingent on the pace in which that top-line recovers. Yeah. Rob, we have time for one more question. Brian, this is Brandon. Look, mortgage rates, obviously, coming down. We expect that to continue to come down further as we turn into '25, but we look at consumer sentiment, existing home sales, housing affordability, those are still concerns. We continue to see pressure there. Consumers are still showing a preference for services versus goods, especially in home improvement. An improvement in these macro trends, we should see and drive sustained increase in discretionary projects in DIY traffic. So, particularly, in the bigger-ticket categories, which is what we're watching for, that's the inflection that we expect. But in terms of the timing and our ability to call that, that's what's unclear to us at this point."

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Second quarter sales were $23.6 billion, with comparable sales down 5.1% from the same period last year. While we're pleased that we delivered positive comps in Pro and online sales, we continue to manage through softness in DIY demand. Although this remains a challenging industry backdrop for the homeowner, I'm pleased with our team's ability to effectively manage the business. This is reflected in our disciplined expense management across the company, along with continual progress on our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI, initiatives. These efforts helped us respond to the pullback in DIY discretionary projects and unpredictable weather across the country to deliver better-than-expected flow-through, while improving the customer experience. Later in the call, Joe will provide more detail on our improved customer service results in Q2. We're also encouraged to see results from our ongoing investments in our Total Home strategy this quarter, allowing us to deliver mid-single-digit positive comps in Pro and 2.9% comparable sales growth online. This demonstrates the importance of these strategic investments and shows that our Total Home strategy is gaining traction even in this pressured macro environment. Our resilient small-to-medium Pro customers are responding to the way we've transformed our product and service offerings to meet their needs. Bill and Joe will provide more detail on our successful Pro initiatives later in the call. When it comes to online sales, we delivered growth across all three business areas, driven by continued improvement in conversion rates as customers responded to our compelling offers and to our new expanded same-day delivery options that are now available on multiple platforms. In Q2, we added Uber Eats to our list of delivery partners, which also includes DoorDash, Shipt and Instacart, in addition to our last-mile technology partner, OneRail, provides a fully integrated solution available on lowes.com and in store. As we continue to involve our omnichannel strategy, we've learned that having multiple delivery platforms extend our reach into both urban and suburban areas and helps us drive incremental sales with different types of customers, especially younger generations who are more digitally savvy. We're also reaching a broader customer base and making a deeper connection with our new and existing customers through our marketing campaigns, featuring sports icons like Lionel Messi, widely recognized as the best soccer player in the world. We have very effectively leveraged our partnership with Messi to gain exposure to our new DIY loyalty program, MyLowe's Rewards. Overall, we're very pleased with our MyLowe's Rewards loyalty program, which just launched nationwide in March. And through this program, we've learned more about our customers' lifestyle and purchasing trends, which will allow us to curate meaningful offers for them now and in the future. Now let me tell you about how we're leading the way with innovation and home improvement. Lowe's is working with Apple to help customers visualize and design their dream kitchens using Apple Vision Pro. This past quarter, we piloted an in-store design experience for our customers in three test markets, where with the help from a Lowe's associate, customers could wear the Apple Vision Pro and use the Lowe's Style Studio app to explore and customize hundreds of kitchen designs in 3D using products, fixtures and appliances all available at Lowe's. This is just one example of how we're leaning into innovation, while we're also working with leading platforms like NVIDIA, OpenAI and Palantir to develop AI solutions for both our customer and our associates to help us improve how we sell, shop and how we work. Before I close, let me give you an update on the trends we're seeing in the macro environment. At the beginning of the year, our full year outlook reflected our expectation that macro and consumer trends in 2024 would be similar to the back half in 2023. That assessment has turned out to be accurate, and yet there still remains a great deal of uncertainty, particularly around interest rates and inflation. In terms of housing specifically, we're seeing significant implications as a result of a lock-in effect. Simply put, people aren't moving nearly as often as they typically do because current mortgage rates are so much higher than their existing rates. And as a consequence, housing turnover is hovering near its lowest levels since the mid-1990s. And the preference for spending on services, especially for the more affluent consumer, has persisted much longer than expected. That said, the three core drivers of our business remain strong: home prices continue to appreciate, which is sustaining historically high levels of home equity; disposal personal income is now growing faster than inflation; and the aging housing stock means people will need to make repairs and improvements in their homes. When you combine those factors with trends like a large number of millennial-forming households, baby boomers aging in place and people continuing to work from home, we remain optimistic about the medium- to long-term outlook of the home improvement industry. And in the meantime, our operating philosophy in this challenging home improvement macro environment is very straightforward: we will continue to invest in technology and innovation, we'll offer our customers value and differentiation whenever and however they choose to shop, and we will be incredibly disciplined with our expense management. We will achieve this by improving our operational efficiency through our PPI initiatives and making the right investments in our Total Home strategy. Although we are unable to call the date for the recovery in home improvement, we are confident that we'll be in a strong position to take share when the market begins to inflect. In closing, I want to thank our frontline associates for their dedication to our customers and communities. One of the best parts of my job is visiting stores every week. And in the first half of this year, I personally visited all 15 geographic regions. These store visits give me an opportunity to personally thank our wonderful associates for their hard work and provide me with invaluable insights into how we can continually enhance our customer experience. Thank you again for joining us this morning. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Bill. Simeon, this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of that. I think what's difficult for us to determine in home improvement is where you're actually losing or gaining share specifically in the categories of DIY and Pro. I get the foundation of your question, but one thing we can confirm for sure is that our Pro business is growing, so we do believe that we're taking share just based on the maturation of the strategic initiatives that you heard from me, Joe and Bill. As we look at the DIY, the best way for me to explain and answer the question is our sales are much more concentrated in bigger-ticket DIY discretionary purchases. And when you look at big-ticket discretionary projects in the second quarter, the DIY demand was softest in those categories and in those projects. As you mentioned, we're still roughly approximately 75% DIY. So, any pullback in these big-ticket discretionary categories is really more of a disproportionate impact to us. So, I don't know that we're losing share in DIY as much as the dynamic of these big discretionary projects in the quarter affected us. And that's really the way we're looking at it. Now here's the good news. The good news is we feel great about our assortment from a merchandising perspective. We feel great about our pricing, our execution, our marketing. And we believe this is just a macro issue that we're dealing with relative to DIY big-ticket discretionary. So, when we look at Q2, even though it was a challenging economic environment, we feel great that we could grow mid-single-digit positive comp in Pro, we could deliver almost 3% growth online, and we're still managing through macro headwinds with DIY discretionary spend. So, we believe that when the DIY market inflect at some point in the future, we're in a perfect position to take overall market share in home improvement because of the strength we're seeing in Pro and online. So with that, I'll let Brandon take the second part of the question. So, Steven, thank you for the question. I'll take the first part of it. Look, I think for us, when we think about our guidance change for the year, it really comes down to just being prudent and being cautious based on the macro environment and the overall customer sentiment specifically around big-ticket DIY discretionary spend. We're all aware that we have an environment of elevated interest rates and inflation. And because of that, the DIY customer is just on the sidelines, waiting for some form of an inflection to take place. So, we can't call when that's going to happen, but we felt based on what we saw in the second quarter that it was prudent just to take a cautious approach to our guidance for the second half. And really, that's what we decided to do. I'll let Brandon take the rest of your question. And Kate, this is Marvin. One thing we don't talk a lot about is how we've converted our regional distribution centers to be more of a flow-through of product versus stocking a product. If you go back to six years ago, these RDCs were basically the traditional hub-and-spoke distribution centers that basically held and stored inventory and replenished stores. And that really put a lot of pressure on turns and overall inventory position. But over the years, the team has converted that to being majority flow. So, we're just becoming more of a cross-dock type of environment, and we have a very small percent of the inventory being stocked. That will continue to evolve over time. And as Brandon noted, we continue to make investments and finalize our build-out of our market delivery. That also puts us in a great position to continue to be the industry leader in appliances without having to hold that inventory the way we did years ago in the back of every store. So, there are cost of things that we're working on that's going to give us the ability to improve our insight position, but also improve our turns at the same time. Yeah. I'm going to just let Joe and Bill talk a little bit about PPI. To Brandon's point, I mean, we are incredibly pleased with the progress that we've made. Initially, our productivity improvement initiatives were focused almost exclusively on store operations. And now, we've created a culture where every functional area is driving their own PPI initiatives to not only drive improvements in the business and productivity, but also just driving overall efficiencies. So, I'm going to let Joe talk a bit about operations, and then Bill will talk about merchandising and what we're going to be seeing not only in the back half of the year, but going forward. So, Joe, we'll start with you. Thanks, Robby. Hey, David, thank you for the question. I think, first, if we could take a step back and think about what we've done thus far, and one of the things that we identified from the very beginning of this transformation was the fact that we needed a very consistent and coherent approach to how we serve the core customer. And really it started with service levels in the store because regardless of what level of fulfillment and fulfillment capabilities you have in home improvement, your stores will still be an incredibly important part of the fill-in project nature need for the Pro customer. And so, our service levels were subpar at best. And so, Joe and team have done an incredible job of elevating those standards. And then, we had to get our product assortment right. We had customers who no longer shopped with us because there were brands that they were loyal to that literally had stopped selling to Lowe's. And so, Bill and his team has done an equally incredible job of bringing those brands back to us. Bill noted in his prepared comments just the success of our relationship with Klein Tools. And Klein was one of those customers that when we arrived was no longer doing business with Lowe's. And it remains the number one brand for electrical and HVAC Pros. And then, we have to get committed to our inventory levels. We talk a lot about job lot quantities, but we had to do that in a way that we gave Pros confidence and also in a way that we would not leave our stores vulnerable for large purchases that we could replenish quickly. And so, after we established those foundational things, we knew that the next step was creating stickiness where you would give those customers a reason to shop us versus the competition. We rolled out our loyalty program a little over a year ago. And then, we rolled out a more sophisticated CRM platform. And now, we're continuing to build on all of those things with more job site fulfillment. And so, Quonta Vance, our EVP of Pro and Home Services, at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Conference is going to lay out our long-term vision of where we plan to take Pro. And that's going to have a lot to do with identifying segments of Pro that we are barely scratching the surface today from a share standpoint that we're going to start to pursue in addition to ways we're going to enhance fulfillment and how we're going to be able to bring a more digitally friendly relationship with Pros so they could have a large selection of product choices and do it in a more seamless nature. We're incredibly excited about our Pro customer. And as I said earlier, we believe strongly that the pressure that we're feeling with the discretionary big-ticket DIY is in large part a macro influence issue. And so, as we now have momentum with the Pro, momentum with our digital strategy, we believe that when the marketplace inflects and the DIY customer starts to have a stronger confidence in making those discretionary purchases that we're going to have the full flywheel effect of our market share gains. In the meantime, we're going to be incredibly disciplined on these key parts of our business, but we're very excited about what we're doing in Pro but more importantly, what we're going to be doing in the future. Well, the great thing about our gig network and the work that we've done online is that we're serving all customers and giving them ability to get same-day, next-day fulfillment across all of our partners. We feel really good about what's happening in our rural markets. They performed to our expectations. We are piloting a lot of unique and different initiatives in some of these stores. And you could argue that we're pressure testing some of these locations to see what works and what does not work. One thing I will tell you is that we're still very excited about what we're doing with our workwear initiative, specifically with Carhartt. We're excited with what we're seeing with our pet food and pet initiative overall, and what we're seeing with just the ATV and other activities our rural customers participate in. But we're pleased with our rural performance. We're pleased that we're able to take this digital gig platform and serve customers in both urban, suburban and rural areas. And we're just continuing to build on that. And we'll provide more context when we get together in December, but we think rural is going to be a significant part of our growth strategy. So Brian, this is Marvin. I'll take another angle at your question. And so for us, obviously, we don't have a crystal ball to call the inflection when that will happen nor to Brandon's earlier comments, can we pinpoint what rate environment we have to be in before it starts to positively inflect this DIY discretionary pullback for big ticket. But what we're trying to do is in this headwind environment that we're in is just continuing to leverage our great balance sheet, to invest in technology and innovation, to make sure we continue to execute our Total Home strategy, which is allowing us to pick up share in Pro, improve our online business, continue to build out a technology platform for our home installation business, which was incredibly neglected from a technology standpoint for many, many years, because we know that when the inflection happens and the DIY return, we want to be perfectly positioned to really take share, not just in DIY, but also across all the other elements that I talked about. So, rather than sitting back and waiting, we're aggressively working in this downturn leveraging our balance sheet to do these aggressive investments and position ourselves. So, when it happens, whenever the macro inflection occurs, we just want to be ready to take advantage of it, and we think we will be. And so, we're just fortunate that we have the ability to continue to be aggressive in all of those areas and just preparing for the eventual time when the market will open back up again, and we're going to be prepared when it does. So look, I will rescue Brandon from that question and answer for him. We tend not to be that precise with current monthly trends. The best way for me and us to answer that question, Brian, and I appreciate the question, is when we look at our current business trends, they are reflective of guidance we gave, understanding that our business will fluctuate throughout the quarter. And so, we're not going to give a specific comp percent other than to say we feel confident that our current trends reflect the guidance we gave. And I think that's probably the best efficient way to ask it. No, thanks for the question."

            "name": "Bill Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. Despite continuing softness in DIY discretionary demand, we're pleased that we delivered positive online comps and mid-single-digit positive Pro comps this quarter. We now have the right brands for Pros, the right inventory quantities and the right product assortments to meet the needs of this demanding customer. Our strong Pro performance in this challenging macro environment means that our efforts to transform the Pro customer experience are working. Now turning to our results in building products, where we delivered above-average comps in rough plumbing, electrical and millwork, and positive comps in building materials, driven by continued growth in Pro across all building materials subdivisions. Within rough plumbing, we also drove strong results in some hot weather categories, like air circulation and HVAC, and we continue to deliver strong results in water heaters. Just one warm weather example. We recently rolled out MRCOOL mini split air conditioners in 1,200 stores. These ductless systems are known for their advanced technology, energy efficiency and ease of insulation, which means our DIY customers can now install their own mini HVAC system without having to hire a professional installer. Now let's shift gears to home decor. We continue to see persistent pressure in bigger-ticket DIY discretionary projects in flooring and kitchen and bath, consistent with the trends that began in the third quarter of 2023. And we continue to lead the industry in appliances, and we are pleased with our overall performance where we delivered above-average comps and double-digit growth in Pro sales. When you put it all together, we have the whole package for custom shopping for new appliances. We have the widest assortment of the leading brands. We have a simple and seamless shopping experience, both in-store and online. And we have a best-in-class fulfillment solution with next-day and two-day delivery options, thanks to our multiyear investment in our market delivery infrastructure. And we continue to bring the most innovative products to market, like the Lowe's exclusive Hisense convertible four-door refrigerator, which has a fingerprint-resistant finish and an extra storage drawer with different temperature settings that can be controlled over WiFi from your mobile phone. In paint, we are now partnering with Sherwin-Williams to offer customers free same-day delivery nationwide. Since painting is the number one home improvement project, we're making it easy and convenient for customers to order paint and paint supplies online and get it all delivered quickly right to their door. This delivery option is just another added convenience, especially if you happen to run short or out of supplies in the middle of a painting project. Now let's talk about hardlines, where unfavorable weather pressured traditional spring seasonal categories like lawn and garden and seasonal and outdoor living. Given our DIY customer mix, sales pressure in these two DIY-dominant categories greatly impacted overall comp sales for the quarter. In outdoor power equipment, the addition of Toro now gives us the strongest lineup in the industry, along with John Deere, Aaron's, EGO, CRAFTSMAN, Husqvarna, Kobalt and SKIL; no one can beat it. In tools, we're expanding our collection of private-branded cobalt tools with a 24-volt paint sprayer, multi-material cutter and finish nailer. And with our introduction of Klein Tools and their new KNECT system, which is an impact rated system of sockets, drivers and ratchets that are compatible with both hand tools and power tools, this system is proprietary to Klein, the number one brand for electricians and HVAC professionals. And KNECT is also exclusive to Lowe's in the home center channel, where we now have the largest assortment of Klein Tools in home improvement retail. During the quarter, we were also pleased with the success of our CRAFTSMAN Days events, where we highlighted CRAFTSMAN products for multiple merchandising divisions with more than 100 products featured both in-store and online. As we look ahead to Q3 and the fall season, we have a strong product lineup ready for the fall, starting with Halloween. It's bigger than ever before with everything from new animatronics to inflatables along with fall cleaning and fall harvest and with the decor that can last the entire fall season. It is already available online and in-store. Shifting gears, we continue to deliver on our perpetual productivity improvement or our PPI initiatives. Our marketing team is rebranding our retail media network program to a simpler platform where we help our brand partners meet a wide range of marketing objectives from performance on shelf and new product launches to seasonal promotions and multiproduct sales. We're also pleased with the progress we've made working with our suppliers to take out costs that we absorbed over the last few years. We continue to work together with our suppliers to claw back these costs while also looking to reinvest into our marketing and merchandising strategies to drive traffic and sales. As I wrap up, I want to once again thank our supplier partners and our merchants for their partnership and hard work in bringing our customers the best brands, innovative products and compelling offers that offer value and new solutions for our customers' home improvement needs. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Joe. Yes, Steven, this is Bill. So, we actually see our -- the promotional activity remaining relatively stable. When you get around certain events, Memorial Day, July 4, et cetera, you've got offers that are out there that are seasonally relevant. And we try to make sure that we're out there meeting the consumer at that time as well. And so, when you look at Q3, we've got Labor Day in front of us. So, we're going to be out there making sure that we've got seasonally relevant offers that are out there for that time as we shift gears into the fall season. But from a promotional activity, we're relatively stable. And we're seeing on the appliance side that we're back to more of a normal activity as it relates to how the appliance industry is going to market. So, nothing really out of the norm. Yeah. Thanks, Joe. Robby, on the merch side, I hit a couple of them in my prepared remarks. We're working on costs with suppliers as an ongoing process, and the merchants do that on a daily basis through product line reviews, business reviews. But assortment productivity is part of what we do on a weekly basis and making sure that we've got the right stuff in the stores and online. I hit on retail media network, that's part of what we're doing as well, making sure that working with our vendor partners to look at different options in regards to how we put marketing strategies together, our private brand work that we've been doing over the last six years to focus on opportunities of where we can put private brands into our assortments. Those opportunities to put those products into our assortment typically come with a higher margin. And so, that offers that opportunity to put a better performing product in the assortment. So, those are just a few examples on the merch side."

            "name": "Joe McFarland",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by recognizing our frontline associates. Their dedication to serving our customers is reflected in continued improvement in our customer satisfaction scores over last year. And while we continue to elevate the customer experience, we also managed staffing well in a dynamic environment and achieve greater payroll productivity. We achieved this improvement in customer service and productivity by continuing to shift associate time from non-customer-facing areas to focus on selling and assisting customers, which leads me to a question we often hear from our investors, namely, do our perpetual productivity improvement, or PPI, initiatives negatively impact our customer experience? Let me address that head on. We found that the opposite is true. For a number of years now, we've been working smarter with tech-enabled solutions that make our associates more productive while enhancing customer service at the same time. The new In-Store Mode on our mobile app is a great example. When customers enter our store, they can enable In-Store Mode using the Lowes.com app on their phone, providing them with a detailed product and location information to help them navigate the store with ease. In addition to being a tremendous customer resource, In-Store Mode also helps free up associates so they can spend more time selling and focusing on customers who need help. And we're already working on the next innovations to the In-Store Mode to further streamline the shopping experience. Our PPI initiatives are also enabling us to reduce returns, which are now at historic lows for our company. There are a number of factors driving these results. Beginning with the returns desk, associates are using our modern omnichannel system, which makes the process as easy as a quick scan with the system immediately accounting for return policies. Second, we're collecting more precise information on why an item was returned so we can work together with our vendors to address any issues and prevent returns from happening in the first place. Third, we've identified key inflection points in our supply chain to reduce damages on more fragile items, like appliances, to better ensure that they arrive in pristine condition, therefore reducing returns. Even though we've already made substantial progress on our productivity journey, our team is already piloting some of the next round of innovations on our PPI roadmap. I'm looking forward to sharing more details about these initiatives at our Analyst and Investor Conference in December. Shifting gears now to Pro, where we continue to gain momentum with our core small- to mid-sized Pro customer as we delivered mid-single-digit positive Pro comps this quarter. The recent investments we've made in job site delivery and high velocity Pro SKUs are paying dividends, making it easier for us to fulfill larger orders and quickly replenish inventory within our store. And we're delivering outsized growth in Pro online sales as Pros appreciate the enhanced online shopping experience that we've created specifically for them. Looking ahead, we were pleased to hear from Pros on our recent survey that their backlogs remain healthy and consistent with last year. And what's also encouraging is that 75% of Pros are confident in landing new business. Our EVP of Pro and Home Services, Quonta Vance, will discuss the next phase of our Pro growth strategy at the December Analyst and Investor Conference. Before I wrap up, I want to thank our associates who contributed to our disaster relief efforts to help customers recover from storms, including Hurricanes Beryl and Debby. Lowe's command center, merchandising teams and supply chain teams went into action to pre-stage merchandise at key locations to be able to quickly respond to customers' needs both before and after the storms. I'd like to extend my appreciation to all of our associates for their tireless efforts to serve our communities in their time of need. And now, let me turn it over to Brandon. Robby, thanks for the question. And while we've made a lot of progress, we're only in the middle innings of the productivity journey, a lot of runway still in front of us. I've talked about things in the past, front-end transformation. We're not even 50% through our front-end transformation. This is not only focused on the operations side, but also the sales side. And so, we worked hand-in-hand. Things like our activity-based labor model that we continue to invest in, we've continued to refine the advanced labor management tools that we're using today. And also, the MST program that has added 30,000-plus associates to the sales force. And so, as the teams continue to work together, we continue to see a lot of runway ahead, streamlining the back-end processes are still in front of us and a lot more to go. And so, I'll toss it over to Bill for..."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Lowe's Companies First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Kate Pearlman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you, and good morning. Here with me today are Marvin Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bill Boltz, our Executive Vice President, Merchandising; Joe McFarland, our Executive Vice President, Stores; and Brandon Sink, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n I would like to remind you that our notice regarding forward-looking statements is included in our press release this morning, which can be found on Lowe's Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking, including our expectations for fiscal 2024. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks, uncertainties and important factors, including those discussed in the risk factors, MD&A and other sections of our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. Additionally, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these items to U.S. GAAP can be found in the quarterly earnings section of our Investor Relations website. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Marvin. \nMarvin Ellison: Thank you, Kate, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. First quarter sales were $21.4 billion with comparable sales down 4.1% from the same period last year. Despite the continued pressure in DIY big ticket discretionary spending across the industry, we delivered better-than-expected spring seasonal sales. Overall, we performed well in a challenging home improvement environment, as we adjusted our strategy to win the early spring customer and take share in key categories with data-driven marketing campaigns and our compelling seasonal assortment, which includes our industry-leading outdoor power equipment lineup strengthened by the launch of Toro. \n We also gained traction with our total home strategy reflected in our positive Q1 growth in Pro and online sales. In addition, we improved customer satisfaction while also maintaining a disciplined focus on our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives across all functional areas of the business. Overall, we're excited about our spring strategy, and we're pleased with how our SpringFest campaign resonated with customers, especially in smaller ticket lawn and garden projects. The combination of the right brands, compelling offers, strong store execution and more nimble marketing helped us capitalize on this key time of year. Bill and Joe will provide more detail on our spring and PPI efforts later in the call. Now turning to Pro. \n As I mentioned earlier, we delivered positive Pro comps in Q1 as our strategic investments to improve the Pro experience are driving increased sales and improved customer engagement. Specifically, investments to improve service levels as well as our expanded brand portfolio that now includes client tools are strengthening our relationships with this core customer. This customer has proven resilient as reflected in the recent Pro survey with healthy backlogs in line with last year. Our strategy continues to focus on taking share with the small- to medium-sized pros such as repair and remodel contractors, property managers and trace people. \n We estimate these Pros represent half of the $500 billion Pro market, which remains highly fragmented. We are striving to provide a high level of service with the small- to medium-sized pros as we continue to build trust and credibility. And we continue to invest in Pro growth, which includes expanding our capabilities to handle larger order delivery to the job site while also opening new Lowe's Pro supply branches around the country. There is still significant runway ahead of us to grow our sales with these customers while also leveraging our retail footprint to drive profitability. Now shifting to online. \n In the first quarter, online sales were up approximately 1%. Our ongoing improvement in our conversion rates in Q1 offset continued pressure in bigger ticket DIY categories. This quarter, we expanded our same-day delivery options of partnering with DoorDash and Shipt. Lowe's is the first home improvement retail partner on these platforms and their members now have quick and convenient access to wide assortment of home improvement products across the country. These new partnerships complement our existing same-day delivery options with Instacart in addition to our same-day delivery option on Lowes.com using our last mile partner OneRail. \n Our objective is simple, giving customers access to the home improvement products they need, however they choose to shop. And we're tailoring our digital experience to support the unique needs of different customer shopping journeys based on the type of project. And we're also using virtual and mixed reality to make it easier for customers to explore and visualize different possibilities for their home. Another exciting step forward for Lowe's this quarter was the national rollout of our DIY loyalty program called MyLowe's Rewards. This program is designed to reward customers for choosing Lowe's for the home improvement needs by earning points toward MyLowe's Money, providing free standard shipping as well as other offers and gifts. \n In addition, customers can also save 5% every day on eligible purchases with the MyLowe's Rewards credit card. As MyLowe's Rewards program matures, the purchase data will allow us to better understand the specific needs of each customer and tailor offers to their individual preferences. We're pleased with the early customer adoption and the successful launch, both in-store and online. And our frontline associates have also rallied around this campaign, and I'd like to thank them for their successful efforts to promote MyLowe's Rewards and educate our customers on the benefits. \n Now speaking of the team, we're excited to welcome the best soccer player in the world, Lionel Messi to our Lowe's home team lineup. We're also extending our reach to more sports fans beyond the football fans we connect with as the official home improvement retailer of the NFL. We're now striving to reach the 34 million soccer fans in the U.S. who are not NFL fans and we're excited by the rapid growth of soccer fans in the U.S. This exciting alliance along with our partnership with MLS Club Inter Miami CF and the Copa America 2024 USA tournament gives us the opportunity to build trust and credibility with a broader customer base. These partnerships will help us bring new customers to Lowe's and offer some unique experiences and rewards for these very passionate fans. \n Now I'd like to provide a quick update on our view of the macro. Uncertainty around interest rate cuts, stubborn inflationary pressures and a consumer still showing a preference towards spending on discretionary services and experiences continue to weigh on the DIY home improvement demand. And the outlook for lower mortgage rates and improved housing turnover remains uncertain. Real wage growth and home price appreciation are solid, but the home improvement customer is still on the sideline, expressing concerns about higher cost of living and the state of the overall economy. \n And while the near term is still challenging to read, we remain confident in the medium- to long-term outlook for our industry as our core demand drivers are all supportive of growth. Our continued commitment on our PPI initiatives, combined with our ongoing investments in our Total Home Strategy not only allow us to perform efficiently in this challenging macro environment, it also positions Lowe's for accelerated market share growth when the home improvement market recovers. \n Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our frontline associates for their continued hard work and commitment to Lowe's and to our communities. I've visited stores in 8 of our 15 geographic regions in the first quarter and our frontline associates are simply outstanding. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. \nWilliam Boltz: Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In spite of a challenging home improvement backdrop in Q1, we are pleased with our early spring sales as customers responded to our strong spring assortment and compelling offers. And our improved brand and service offerings resonated with our Pro customers, which led to positive broad-based Pro comps across all 3 geographic divisions. \n This year, our SpringFest strategy went more local than ever by using weather-triggered digital marketing as the spring season broke across different regions. In Q1, we also introduced sneak peaks for SpringFest, featuring doorbusters that were focused on driving traffic into our stores and online with targeted offers with seasonally relevant categories such as soils, mulch, and live goods. Winning the customer with these early seasonal purchases is important as they will often come back multiple times throughout the spring for the remainder of their outdoor project needs. Now turning to our results in hardlines. \n These marketing efforts, paired with the right brands and strong execution helped us deliver positive comp sales on a 1-year and 2-year basis in lawn and garden. Growth was driven by smaller ticket projects in landscape products and live goods, which resulted in increases in both comp sales and transactions in these categories. We are also pleased to be gaining traction with our own Sta-Green private brand, as customers have responded to the quality and the value offered in these lawn care products. And Sta-Green helps provide the consumer with a beautiful lawn and that they can be proud of at a price that won't break the bank. \n For the first time this spring, customers can also purchase select plants and live goods online and have them delivered through lowes.com. Garden products are already some of the most searched items on our website and now customers can conveniently shop for what they need and even order them from their backyard. And as Marvin mentioned, we are excited about our powerful new spring outdoor power equipment lineup as we introduced Toro to our lineup this year. \n Lowe's now offers the largest selection of Toro products of any national retailer with innovations like SmartStow, which allows owners to store their mower upright, reducing the storage footprint by up to 70%, including patented Briggs & Stratton technology, so it doesn't leak oil when stored in this position and with personal pace, a best-in-class self-propelled system that propels the mower at the speed the user is walking. We added these innovative Toro products to an already unmatched brand arsenal, which included EGO, SKIL, Cobalt, Husqvarna, CRAFTSMAN and John Deere. These strong brands helped us deliver positive comp sales in both gas and battery-powered walk behind lawn mowers as well as handheld outdoor power equipment. Now shifting gears to building products. \n Our Pro customers remain busy, which supported positive comps in building materials, with strength in roofing, concrete and block, drywall, and insulation, all helping to fuel that growth. Our added focus on inventory depth and improved in-stocks along with our localization efforts with tailored assortments to the market, continue to give Pro customers the confidence that Lowe's will have what they need to complete the job. Repair and maintenance categories such as water heaters, also continue to perform well, especially with innovative products like A.O. Smith's 120-volt plug-in heat pump water heaters. These Energy Star certified models plug into a standard wall outlet for easy installation and can save homeowners over $600 a year in utility bills compared to a standard electric water heater. \n In Electrical, we are pleased with the performance of client tools, the #1 tool brand for the electrical and HVAC professional. New products like the client circuit breaker finder, make it easy for electricians to quickly identify which breakers and outlets are connected to the breaker panel without turning the breaker on and off. The introduction and expansion of brands like client tools not only drive sales, it also allows us to rebuild the credibility with our Pro customers. \n Turning to home decor, where softer demand in DIY bigger ticket interior categories like flooring, kitchens and bath and appliances persisted. Trends in these categories were largely in line with the results we saw in the second half of last year. Our customers continue to look for value, especially given the persistent inflationary pressures. And our private brand products provide them with both value and style as they look to refresh their homes. Products like our allen + roth Harlow kitchen faucet, which is simple to install with 3 easy steps. And what is really unique, you don't have to go below the sink to install it. Our STAINMASTER PetProtect carpet with leak defense backing helps prevent spills and keeps pet accidents from seeping through to the rug pad or sub floor. STAINMASTER is the most trusted brand in carpet and is exclusive to Lowe's. Turning to appliances. \n We are expanding our market share as we continue to lead the industry with the broadest assortment, compelling values and fast and convenient delivery supported by our market delivery model, which creates a best-in-class fulfillment solution, including next-day delivery in most markets, which is an important option for a customer replacing a broken appliance. Average selling prices remain pressured as we cycle the reintroduction of pre-pandemic promotions across the industry as well as the continued slowdown in discretionary demand. Despite these near-term challenges, our appliance suppliers continue to improve selection with innovation and amazing new products. \n A great example is the Lowe's exclusive GE Freestanding Range with easy wash, a range with the first of its kind removable oven liner that is dishwasher safe, making for easy cleanup. Moving on to merchandising productivity. Our teams are continuing to execute against our extensive perpetual productivity improvement or PPI road map. This quarter, I'd like to highlight the productivity benefits of one initiative, the progress we've made in expanding our private brand penetration. \n The core focus of our private brand strategy is to offer our brand-agnostic DIY customers with style and quality at a great value. Not only do these products provide this for our customers. the product margin rates for our private branded products are typically significantly higher on average compared to the national brand counterparts. As we build out a compelling private brand portfolio from allen + roth decor products, and STAINMASTER products within flooring and paint to Sta-Green lawn care products to Cobalt tools, outdoor power equipment and storage solutions, we are delivering value to the DIY customer and productivity to the bottom line. \n As I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation once again to our vendors for their ongoing partnership, in particular, their support of our merchandising services team. Our 30,000 MST associates keep our shelves stocked, execute resets and enable our Red Vest associates to spend more time serving our customers. We allocate 100% of our MST funds into this program and are pleased with the impact it is having on our customer experience and associate productivity. And I'd also like to thank our merchants for their hard work and dedication as they navigate this dynamic macro environment. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph McFarland: Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by thanking our frontline associates for their hard work this quarter. Customer satisfaction scores were up 100 basis points over last year as we continue to improve our shopping experience for homeowners and pros while at the same time, driving productivity across our company. As we improve our customers' experience, we also remain focused on our associates' experience and our journey to become the employer of choice in retail.\n An example of our commitment to our associates was our decision to close our stores on Easter for the fifth consecutive year, giving our associates a well-deserved day off to spend with their loved ones, one of many ways we work to show our appreciation. We are seeing strong spring staffing levels and higher retention as we continue to invest in wages, associate development and internal mobility. And we have a best-in-class leadership development training program, including a store replicate at our Lowe's University training center, which gives store leaders hands on leadership practice and coaching.\n We have also implemented new weekly routines that help our department supervisors strengthen selling culture and skill set in their stores and prepare these leaders for their next step in their career. As a reminder, more than 80% of our store leadership positions were filled internally last year and nearly 90% of our store leaders started in hourly roles. Another way we are strengthening our selling culture is through our modernized store operating system, which is enabling our associates to close omnichannel sales from within our stores and help customers get everything they came for. So when a customer is looking for something out of stock or can't find the specific style they want in store, our associates can search our online assortment to find what they need and help them seamlessly check out an order that combines in-store and online items.\n Beyond supporting sales, our store teams remain laser-focused on driving productivity. A common misconception that we are hearing is that Lowe's must be nearing the end of our productivity journey given how much progress we've made in the last 5 years. This couldn't be further from the truth. Since this can be hard to see from the outside looking in, let me share some examples. First, we are only 1/3 of the way through our multiyear transformation of the front end of our stores, which includes our proprietary self-checkout registers, a significantly improved buy online pick up in store experience, a streamlined returns process and an optimized front-end selling space.\n Second, we have significantly reduced our return and cancellation rate through improved vendor partnerships, decreased damages and a clear and consistent returns process that's now systematically applied through enhanced technology. Third, we are also enhancing our shrink prevention ecosystem to maintain our best-in-class shrink performance including a new AI technology in partnership with NVIDIA that prompts customers to scan missed items during self-checkout. We're also piloting new product protection with a product security door that unlocks with the customer's phone number instead of needing to find an associate with a traditional key. These are just a few examples from our extensive road map of PPI initiatives.\n Given the strong performance of our frontline associates this quarter, 93% of our stores qualified for our Winning Together quarterly bonus, which is designed specifically for our hourly associates. As we approach Memorial Day weekend, I want to thank our veterans. As a marine, I'm proud of our company's long-standing commitment to supporting our military community. Lowe's ranks among the top military-friendly brands in the U.S. with a 10% off every day military discount, dedicated better than parking spots and nearly 26,000 associates from the military community.\n We work with Department of Defense to bring our jobs directly to transitioning service members and military spouses and have a program to provide training and work experience with Lowe's during their last months of service. We value the skills, dedication and courageous leadership we see in our veterans. In this Memorial Day, I hope you will join us in thanking our associates and camouflage vest for their service. In closing, we are executing to deliver an even better experience for our customers and associates, while unlocking even more productivity across our stores.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brandon. \nBrandon Sink: Thank you, Joe. Starting with our first quarter results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Please note, in Q1 last year, we recognized a gain of $63 million associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business. As a result, my comments today will include comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures from last year.\n First quarter sales were $21.4 billion with comparable sales down 4.1% as improved seasonal weather, combined with strong spring execution drove better-than-expected results. Comparable transactions declined 3.1% as homeowners continue to delay larger discretionary projects. And comparable average ticket was down 1%, with strength in Pro, partly offsetting the impacts of lower DIY bigger ticket sales and ongoing appliance pricing pressure. Our monthly comps were down 6.7% in February, 4.9% in March and 1.1% in April.\n Keep in mind, our monthly comp cadence was impacted by the earlier timing of Easter, which fell in March this year while it was in April last year. Because we closed our stores on Easter, this pressured our March results by approximately 300 basis points and benefited April by the same amount. Gross margin was 33.2% of sales in the first quarter, down 49 basis points from last year, largely driven by ongoing supply chain investments, early spring traffic driving promotions and a modest decline in credit revenue. This was partly offset by lower transportation costs and ongoing PPI initiatives.\n SG&A was 18.8% of sales, down 137 basis points versus last year's adjusted SG&A driven by sales deleverage as well as the cycling of a favorable legal settlement. These pressures were partly offset by PPI initiatives delivered by each functional team across the company. Operating margin of 12.4% declined 201 basis points versus prior year adjusted operating margin. The effective tax rate was 23.7%, largely in line with last year's adjusted effective tax rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $18.2 billion, $1.3 billion lower than last year as we continue to optimize replenishment to align with sales patterns and improve the efficiency of spring product flow. Turning to capital allocation.\n In the first quarter, we generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow. Capital expenditures totaled $382 million as we continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We paid $633 million in dividends at $1.10 per share and repurchased 3 million shares for $743 million, returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders. We ended Q1 at adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 2.93x, and we delivered a return on invested capital above 32%. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, today, we are affirming our full year 2024 outlook. We continue to expect sales ranging from $84 billion to $85 billion and comparable sales in a range of down 2% to down 3% with Pro sales outpacing DIY.\n We expect operating margin in the range of 12.6% to 12.7% and full year earnings per share of approximately $12 to $12.30. To assist with your modeling, here are a few points to keep in mind for the cadence of the year. First, based on the trends we are seeing in the business, we expect second quarter comparable sales to be roughly in line with the first quarter. We continue to expect second half comp sales to improve as we cycle over easier compares from the DIY pullback that intensified in the third quarter of 2023. As I mentioned on our last call, this is not because we are forecasting an improvement in demand trends this year, it's just that the compares are easier in the second half.\n In terms of flow-through, we expect operating margin to remain under pressure in Q2, largely due to sales deleverage and cycling a favorable legal settlement. Taking these factors into account, we expect Q2 operating margin rate to be approximately 150 basis points below the prior year rate and flow through of productivity to improve in the second half of the year.\n Before I close, I'd like to reiterate that our capital allocation strategy remains intact. First, reinvest in the business; second, target a 35% dividend payout ratio and third, return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2024, we plan to use our free cash flow to repay a $450 million bond maturity and then return the remaining cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In closing, we remain focused on investing in our Total Home Strategy. As Marvin mentioned, we are also executing against a multiyear road map of PPI initiatives, which will continue to unlock productivity well beyond 2024. We are well positioned to capitalize on home improvement demand when the market recovers and continue to deliver sustainable shareholder value.\n And with that, we'll open it up for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristian Carlino: It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. Just to dig in on the gross margin. Could you help us understand some of the drivers there? And are you seeing the full run rate of vendor clawbacks at this point? Or does that build over the year. And just broadly, how should we think about the phasing of gross margin expansion over the year relative to the flat gross margin guide? \nBrandon Sink: Yes, sure. This is Brandon. Thanks for the question. So as it relates to gross margins, and we look out for the full year, we are still expecting gross margins to be flat. Our improvements, mainly PPI, we expect those to be more back half weighted. The headwinds, we had many of these in Q1, ongoing investments in our supply chain as we finalize the rollout of market delivery, early investments in our Pro fulfillment initiatives, and spring promos as we continue to execute on our everyday competitive pricing strategy.\n And then the tailwinds, a number of PPI efforts that we continue to execute against, Bill mentioned momentum that we're seeing in private brands, ongoing pricing initiatives. And then as it relates to the callback, we're making really nice progress there. Driving sales now. We're making some of that investment in price, and there's going to be a bit of a lag defect as the new cost turn through inventory here over the next 3 quarters and then also continuing to benefit from lower transportation costs as we leverage our scale to drive rates with our carriers.\n So we also mentioned credit is some first half pressure there related to higher borrowing costs and delinquencies as it relates to our private label credit portfolio, but we expect to be able to manage that roughly flat to the year and then great performance on the shrink side. We continue to expect roughly flat on the year there. \nChristian Carlino: Got it. That's really helpful. And I appreciate the color in the prepared remarks, but I guess, how would you disaggregate some of the bigger ticket trends between more remodeling oriented categories that are more likely financed versus others like big ticket seasonal and appliances, and how are you thinking about the recovery path for maybe these 2 sides of big ticket broadly? \nBrandon Sink: Yes. I think when we look at big ticket in particular, we continue to see pressure, right? We called out large tickets greater than [ 500 ], down 7.6% for the quarter. Most of that right now is still related to DIY, and we're continuing with the Q4 trends that we saw there where big ticket was down 8.8%. I think a lot of that is we look at discretionary. There is some seasonal impact there as we continue to see some level of pressure from patio, from grills with multiyear replacement cycles. We are continuing to see pressure from appliances as we normalize against the promo environment, we get back to more 2019 levels.\n And then also the emerging dynamic with the lock-in effect and higher rates continues to pressure big ticket categories like kitchen and bath, decor and flooring. And those are categories that are sensitive to higher interest rates and the new home occasion. So very much working through that. We're seeing offsets to that with as we continue to drive the Pro business. and that helps boost some of our big ticket. We expect that average ticket for the full year to continue to be roughly flat, but definitely continuing to work through some of the DIY pressures that we're experiencing. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: Marvin, maybe a question for Joe actually on the front-end transformation. I was maybe curious if you could just update us on how you're sort of thinking about the ROI of that initiative. It sounds like it's progressing and we're only 1/3 of the way through. But any color on sort of what the comp lift is or the waterfall benefit we should sort of think through as we work through the whole transformation here? \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. And so thanks for the question, Steve. I won't give the comp benefit, but there are several things that we're seeing. We have a detailed road map as we've laid out. We're 1/3 of the way through. And when I think about the proprietary self-checkout systems we talked about in the past, the user-friendly for the home improvement customer along with the partnership we have with our tech team under Seemantini's leadership, the teams work hand-in-hand. So we're incorporating the technology that we spoke about, NVIDIA, our assisted self-checkout. And in addition, we just finished launching the ability for our gig drivers to pick up from our enhanced buy online pickup in store and all of our gig delivery network. So we're really pleased. And again, third of the way through customer satisfaction scores have improved, the associate engagement has improved and very pleased with where we're at. \nBrandon Sink: And Steve, I'll just add, you mentioned we're only 1/3 of the way through, but we're really pleased with the benefits that we're seeing. We're not going to call out the comps, but just financially speaking, seeing higher sales as we're opening up space on the front end, lower payroll costs, improved returns as we've increased or improved that experience and then the customer experience with the improved front end and BOPIS. So just as we look at all of our KPIs there, 1/3 of the way in, we're pleased with the progress there. \nSteven Forbes: And maybe just a follow-up, as we approach Memorial Day here and think through categories like appliances and the change in the promotional sort of strategy away from bundles and sort of to a buy more, save more strategy. What are you sort of expecting from the consumer in terms of engagement and conversion? Like, is there any early reads that you're seeing or anywhere -- any way to sort of talk through how you sort of expect the consumer to engage here over the coming weeks? \nWilliam Boltz: Yes, Steve, this is Bill. And so the trends we're seeing with appliances are very similar to what we've been seeing really over the last 6 to 12 months in that. We've seen the consumer shift from buying multiple pieces to now single item pieces really in that [ duress ] market. And so that's where we've pivoted our efforts to making sure that we're meeting her where she wants to be met. And we're really pleased that we've continued in a down market to be able to drive units and pick up unit share during that time frame.\n And so that's the efforts that you're going to see us drive as we go through Memorial Day and throughout the remainder of the year. And when you look at what the appliance team is doing, we're also seeing great innovation, as I called out in my prepared remarks with a GE oven that I talked about. But we've also talked about it before, you're seeing wherever we're putting innovation on the floor, you're seeing her respond to that type of product. And that's really the difference that's going on today. You've got a value-conscious consumer that is opting in and you've got a consumer that's not afraid to pay for innovation when that's offered to her as well. So we want to make sure that we meet or where she wants to be met. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I want to talk about the backdrop and any signs of normalization. If you can talk about traffic versus '19, I know a big ticket is part of there, is that third year of negative comps. And I guess we are going to -- I guess, the model says we're going to see a turn by the end of the year. But Brandon, you mentioned that's not macro dependent. That's more business dependent. So curious. And also, by the way, part of that is if there's a category that you're paying attention to that gives you a leading indicator of anything that's turning. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Simeon, just as it relates to the macro first, we ultimately need to see customers, consumers reengage for us to have confidence that the home improvement is inflecting. We're watching for an uptick specifically on discretionary bigger ticket projects. I mentioned earlier what we're seeing. We're not seeing that at the moment. I think we're watching consumers continue to digest and adjust to the monetary tightening, which is working its way through the system, and that continues to have an outsized impact on housing where we see affordability challenges and historically low turnover.\n So again, we're not seeing that inflection point. Consumers continue to kind of remain on the sidelines. As Marvin mentioned, and we're waiting on that catalyst. We don't necessarily expect or understanding the timing of that. But just as it relates to the comp cadence, when we look at the second half, this is about the improvement in second half, not an improving macro, as I said in my prepared remarks. It's just easier year-over-year comparisons. And we looked at this in a number of different ways, tops down, bottoms up across multiple time frames. We've looked at DIY Pro categories and geographies, and we feel comfortable, was sort of the down [ 4 ] over the first half and moving back to a more historical mix of transactions and ticket as we start getting into the back half of the year. \nMarvin Ellison: Simeon, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add is more of a broader theme that we're focused on. And that is managing through any unique challenges we're facing today. And I think Q1 reflects that we're executing at a high level in spite of some of the macro headwind that we're dealing with. But we're really positioning ourselves to really come out of this downturn as a much better company. We've invested billions of dollars in supply chain, IT infrastructure, our digital platform, our omni systems, store environment, merchandising assortments.\n And in other words, whenever the macro decides to turn, we're going to come out of it as a much stronger, more productive company. And so although we can't predict when that's going to happen, Brandon outlined our commitment to our capital allocation strategy, we're going to continue to invest, we're going to continue to make sure we prepare ourselves. And whenever the positive trends start to show up, we're going to be ready for it and we're going to take full advantage of it. \nSimeon Gutman: Related to that, Marvin or Brandon, incremental margins when the business turns, is there a case to be made that you spend into an upturn faster than what you're spending now? Are there places that you've held back on such that incremental margins aren't, I guess, typical cycle coming out into a housing recovery? \nBrandon Sink: No, Simeon, I would say we've been fully committed to our long-term road map in terms of capital, major projects and PPI and top line growth initiatives still been fully committed to that. But we haven't pulled back at all. And as Marvin mentioned, we're investing in the business for the long term. Committed to the long-term trajectory and looking forward to comps starting to turn whenever that may be, and we believe kind of a long-term algorithm holds in place once that happens. \nOperator: Next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Given the state of the home improvement cycle, how are you currently looking at the trade-off between driving sales and market share versus sacrificing gross margin, understanding that you expect your gross margin to improve over the course of the year, are you more willing to make this trade-off now with the view that it will be a benefit as the cycle recovers. \nMarvin Ellison: Michael, I'll take the first part of that. This is Marvin, and I'll let Brandon give some additional perspective. I think Bill said it best. We're trying to meet the customer where the customer currently is at. And if the customer is looking for value, value does not always equate to low price, it equates to a great return for the dollar you spend. And so we feel really fortunate that we can make early investments in the customer with events and activities to win that early spring customer and still have an opportunity to outperform earnings per share and operating margin.\n And then as Brandon mentioned, we have initiatives in place that give us confidence that we'll roughly recover any gross margin decrement in the back half and in the year relatively flat. So we're going to be able to pull all the levers we have to make sure that we can aggressively serve the customer well. And we believe in a very simple philosophy, and that is during the spring season, if you win the customer early, you get multiple shopping occasions throughout the spring and the year and Bill and his team, along with great execution in the stores and the supply chain allowed us to do that. And so that's the overreaching philosophy, then I'll let Brandon give you more specifics on how we think about it for the balance of the year. \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Michael, I would just add, as Marvin said, we were really pleased with our ability to pivot our go-to-market strategy, especially as we saw customer behavior start to change over the back half of last year and our execution, our marketing approach, how we highlighted value, we believe, helped us win Q1, and we did see a little bit of margin pressure from those actions, but really pleased that we were able to manage that and offset that within SG&A and still deliver the bottom line number and I think confident that we can manage the portfolio as we move through the balance of the year.\n You mentioned we do expect some of these gross margin pressures to start to tail off as we move through the year in PPI to start to accelerate. So we're committed to delivering both the top line and the bottom line in line with our guide. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is on the DIY loyalty program. What has been the lift that you've experienced from that -- from rolling that out so far? And what do you expect to see over the course of the year. It seems like given the performance in the first half, while there are easier comparisons in the back half you're probably embedding some contribution from this factor in order to get to the full year guidance? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, Mike, this is Marvin. We're not going to get into the specifics of the lift. But as I remind you and everyone, we launched the program in March. The initial focus was on enrollment, getting active members engaged, app downloads, and we're really pleased with how well it is going. The rollout was very smooth, and it really spotlights the benefits of really modernizing our store operating system. We could not have rolled this loyalty program out a year ago. because we were still in the process of retiring a 30-year operating system, which is now for all intents and purposes, behind us and the store associates engagement was simply tremendous in educating the customer and making sure that they were articulating the value.\n So our objective is just to simply take the data to serve our customers more effectively. Data is a new currency, but it's only beneficial if you use it to benefit the customer experience. We think we'll be able to do that. And we're also believing that we'll be able to get additional trips from the customer throughout the year. Is early, but we're pleased with the results, and we'll look forward to updating you and the external community throughout the year on the progress we're making. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. \nGregory Melich: I wanted to follow up on the comp cadence. It sounds like still some macro pressures. If you look at the comp you just reported, the negative [ 4 ] and you're doing negative [ 2 to 3 ] for the year. How much of that improvement is coming from ticket cycling what was happening a year ago versus traffic improvement? \nBrandon Sink: Yes, Greg, this is Brandon. The majority of that's going to be traffic related. I think as I'll get the breakdown across the year on ticket and transactions, we're, for the most part, expecting average ticket to hold, consistent over the course of the remainder of the year just as we saw here in Q1, some slight pressure, ticket related, as we've shifted down in the smaller ticket seasonal projects, which has boosted transactions. And then we're also seeing continued ticket pressure, as I mentioned, from the DIY big-ticket discretionary and that includes some of the appliance promo pressure. But the flip side is, Pro growth continues to run strong for us, which is helping mix ticket up.\n And then as we look at really the second half of the year and the cadence improve, again, it's a function of really what we're cycling and we expect the transactions to start to pick up as we accelerate into the second half of the year, and we're going to see again, a much more historical relationship between ticket and transaction over the course of the second half of the year. \nGregory Melich: Got it. And then a follow-up on the gross margin. It's still flat for the year, but you'd expect it to be down in the second quarter similar to 1Q and then up 50 bps in the back half. Is that the right way to model that? \nBrandon Sink: I won't put a specific number on Q2, but we do expect Q2 to be similarly pressured with supply chain investments and some of the credit pressure that we're continuing to see. But for sure, as we get into the second half, we're seeing the improved -- the acceleration of PPI flow through with some of the supplier clawback cost out. There's some timing benefits that will come through in the second half of the year and then some of the credit pressures just start to ease. Again, that's a cycling, a timing issue as we started to see some of the interest rate pressures and delinquencies started to pressure in the second half of last year. So we expect that to smooth out as well. So that's sort of the shape of the curve there. \nGregory Melich: I may have missed it, but was the new reward program part of the gross margin pressure in 1Q or no? \nBrandon Sink: Not significant at this point, just given the timing of when we scaled that. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. \nSeth Sigman: I want to talk about how the quarter played out. So the quarter started off weaker as you reported originally. And then you did see an improvement came in ahead of forecast. How do you think about how much of that was driven by seasonal versus maybe some other areas that could have come in a little bit better? \nMarvin Ellison: I'll take the first part, and then I'll hand it over to Bill. I mean this was broadly a weather dynamic from a standpoint of how the sales flow. We feel really good about the execution. We feel great about some of the initiatives with SpringFest and how the customers respond to it. But the cadence was really driven by the impact of weather to the initiatives. I'll let Bill kind of walk through some of the specific initiatives and how it played out in Q1. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And Seth, I think the big difference for us this year is that we took a slightly different approach to our marketing. We -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we took a geo-targeted approach, which was really going south to north with our SpringFest campaign. And we put some offers out there that were seasonally relevant. We were able to target those south to north. And then we got a little bit of weather favorability that happened in March, and then we carried that into April. We're able to navigate some storm weather. We took advantage of that. But the teams did a really nice job of making sure that we had new products, new brands.\n We saw Toro really respond well for us. We continue to see EGO perform well. We continue to see anything that we've done, as I said earlier, in a question that was asked earlier around innovative products perform well. We've seen the consumer respond now with the weather advantages, the grass is growing. So they're out there buying zero-turn riding mowers. They're buying full-size gas grills. So we're seeing that work. And now we've got -- as we go into Q2, we've got Memorial Day, July 4, Father's Day in front of us. So we've got to take advantage of those events as we finish out the quarter. So those are really the results.\n And where we've had weather, we've seen it play in our advantage. And the lawn and garden team, as I said, had really nice results in the first quarter, driving that with traffic-driving events with soils, mulch, live goods and they took advantage of that customer that was out there getting their yard ready early in spring. So that was really the drivers. \nBrandon Sink: Seth, this is Brandon. Just one more thing. Just as you recall at the beginning of the year, we did plan for a much more normal spring season, and we had called out the last 2 years about a $400 million drag related to unfavorable weather in the last 2 years. So cycling against that. Some of that recovery moved into Q2 over the last couple of years. So that's also embedded into our outlook as we're looking at Q2 for this year. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. Just a related question on the improvement that you saw in the Pro business going back to positive this quarter. Obviously, there's a lot that you're doing to drive that. But any sense whether that reflects market share gains or just broader improvement in some of those Pro-oriented categories? And I guess, any perspective on if your performance is coming from customer growth or wallet share and just any context there? \nMarvin Ellison: Well, I think overall, we're very pleased with the performance of our Pro strategy. As you know, it's been a 5-year investment journey on things like investing in job-like quantities for inventory, improving service levels, adding national brands, Bill and I, both mentioned the great performance of client tools, the #1 brand for electricians and HVAC professionals, bringing brands like that to the assortment, it just adds to the credibility of the turnaround that we've been on and trying to win some of these customers back from years past, in addition to a stronger digital platform, a great loyalty program that's resonating with the customers.\n And from the survey results that we shared, I mean, this is a resilient customer that continues to fight through the economic headwinds and their backlog is relatively equal to last year. So overall, that's driving it, whether or not we're taking share or not is, look, we don't want to determine that as much as we're just looking at internally at just much improved execution and results. And I'll let Joe talk a little bit about some of the other initiatives that were driving that. That we think is really resonating that allowed us to get this business back to positive. \nJoseph McFarland: Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Seth, as you think about some of the investments that we've made, Marvin has called them out, Bill has called them out. Job-like quantity, safety stock, but also our enhancement in our job site delivery for larger orders. If you think about the maturity of our loyalty program in Pro, our CRM program, or growing share of wallet. We continue to expand our Lowe's Pro supply. And then from the survey that Marvin had mentioned, the dimensions of the [ health ], we look at backlogs and materials, credit, labor and the project type. The Pros have been stable and steady there. And so we're pleased with the gains we're making with this customer, both in-store, product-wise and online. \nMarvin Ellison: And Seth, I'd just close the Pro discussion with just one additional point. We're really focused on the customer that we can serve at a very high level and that's that small to medium Pro. And we estimate that's a [ $200 billion ] market opportunity. And so we are focused squarely on that customer. That customer still leverages the store. For fill in we can leverage the productivity of our existing real estate footprint to serve that customer well. We can do it without having to make dramatic investments in op expense in addition to the fulfillment capabilities, as Joe talked about. So we are very confident that our strategy is working and that is reflected in the results. We still have other investments to make, we'll make them, and we hopefully will continue to see this business head in the right direction in spite of a very difficult macro. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict from Baird. \nPeter Benedict: I guess just on the DIY loyalty program, I know it didn't have much of an impact on the P&L here in the first quarter. But just curious how we should think about that longer term as it scales? And maybe a comment also on the associated lift in the private label credit sign-ups, what you're seeing there, what that means, I guess, going forward, any perspective on how private level credit has been for you guys historically and what's maybe possible here with this new program? \nBrandon Sink: Peter, thanks for the question. This is Brandon. Just -- again, Marvin hit on this a bit, but our goals overall with the loyalty program are to create further stickiness with our DIY drive repeat visits and spend over time, our ability to get the data and drive more personalized marketing. Super pleased with what we're seeing with engagement from the customer standpoint and our associates. We're managing the enrollments to membership points redemptions.\n You mentioned sort of financially we're targeting effectively one more trip annually from our DIY customers. That's the revenue upside as we see it, and it's going to take some time to gauge success of that. So we're going to have to watch that play out over the course of the year. And then in terms of the overlay with the credit program, I mean, we are bundling and building on top of a 5% credit offer that we believe is best-in-class. It's going to continue to drive increased penetration there, and we think that value really resonates with the customer, and we're able to make that work financially. So we think it's a win-win there. \nJoseph McFarland: Peter, to add on Brandon quickly. We're pleased with the first kind of loyalty perk that we rolled with Mother's Day, the engagement we had with the members and new members as well as our associates and our ability to gain incremental loyalty members. And so as an early example there, the Mother's Day engagement, we're very pleased with. \nPeter Benedict: That's great. And then I guess my follow-up would be just around -- just the plans for the go-to-market strategy over the balance of the year. I mean it clearly sounds like you guys took some steps here during the spring to capture some incremental business. As you think about the back half of the year, have you layered in additional, I guess, events or promotions to kind of help get those comps -- that comp trend improved. If not, is that a lever you think you'll need to pull or be willing to pull? Just kind of curious how you're thinking about the balance of the year, the second half of the year with respect to promotions. \nWilliam Boltz: Yes, Peter, it's Bill. And so the promotional environment remains stable. And so nothing radically crazy. We're going to go similar to what we've been doing. We want to be seasonally relevant as we go into the back half of the year, obviously, we'll be out there as we go into fall with Labor Day. We're going to introduce Halloween. We're going to make sure that we're relevant with holiday and gift center and introduce and set our stores for spring in the Deep South for that December-January time frame. But we're going to make that transition.\n We're going to be relevant as the consumer comes out of those key seasonal categories, we'll make that transition into those fall seasonal categories, but there won't be anything goofy that will happen in the second half of the year. And so that's how we're going to approach it. \nOperator: Our final question comes from line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: First one, I wanted to dig into regional trends. Some peers have been calling out less worse trends in the West. It was one of the first regions to enter the housing recession. So are you seeing less worse trends there? It looks like this year [ 15 ] geographic regions outperformed the company average. So any more detail in terms of regional variability that you're seeing would be helpful. That's my first question. \nJoseph McFarland: Jonathan, this is Joe. Thank you for the question. From a geographic standpoint, as we said, where we've seen great weather, we've seen great performance. But from an overall and geographical standpoint, our West is our best performance for Q1. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. And Jonathan, I would just add, consistent Pro outperformance across all of our regions. So really pleased with that. And then conversely, pretty much uniform ongoing pressure in DIY big-ticket discretionary. So that's been pretty broad-based on both the Pro side and the pressure and no real differences in what we're seeing across regions. \nMarvin Ellison: Yes. I think the only comment I will make, Jonathan, is that our rural stores continue to be our best performing subset of stores within the overall geography and some of the initiatives that Bill's teams initiated with pet and apparel continue to perform really well in those locations, and we continue to evaluate the expansion of those categories in our rural environments. But overall, the West outperformed. As Brandon mentioned, Pro was widespread at a really strong performance. And the rural set of our stores kind of is the high watermark in performance among all geographic locations. \nJonathan Matuszewski: That's really helpful. And then just quickly, just to circle back on big ticket. I know there were some questions earlier. Just to be clear, what does the midpoint of your annual comp guidance embed for big ticket, right? So over [ 500 ] transactions were down around 7.5%. So does that 2% to 3% comp decline for the year requires sequential improvement in year-over-year declines for purchases over [ 500 ] or are you expecting that to basically continue throughout the rest of '24. \nBrandon Sink: Yes. Again, Jonathan, I think just on an absolute dollar performance standpoint, we're expecting more of the same in terms of what we saw second half. We don't have any macro improvement sort of embedded in. So from an absolute standpoint across these categories, we're expecting similar performance as we move through the year, but the comps should improve significantly in these categories just again based on what we're cycling and when we started to see the downturn in the second half of last year. \nKate Pearlman: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in August. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Lowe's First Quarter 2024 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brandon Sink",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Starting with our first quarter results. We generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Please note, in Q1 last year, we recognized a gain of $63 million associated with the sale of our Canadian retail business. As a result, my comments today will include comparisons to certain non-GAAP measures from last year.\n First quarter sales were $21.4 billion with comparable sales down 4.1% as improved seasonal weather, combined with strong spring execution drove better-than-expected results. Comparable transactions declined 3.1% as homeowners continue to delay larger discretionary projects. And comparable average ticket was down 1%, with strength in Pro, partly offsetting the impacts of lower DIY bigger ticket sales and ongoing appliance pricing pressure. Our monthly comps were down 6.7% in February, 4.9% in March and 1.1% in April.\n Keep in mind, our monthly comp cadence was impacted by the earlier timing of Easter, which fell in March this year while it was in April last year. Because we closed our stores on Easter, this pressured our March results by approximately 300 basis points and benefited April by the same amount. Gross margin was 33.2% of sales in the first quarter, down 49 basis points from last year, largely driven by ongoing supply chain investments, early spring traffic driving promotions and a modest decline in credit revenue. This was partly offset by lower transportation costs and ongoing PPI initiatives.\n SG&A was 18.8% of sales, down 137 basis points versus last year's adjusted SG&A driven by sales deleverage as well as the cycling of a favorable legal settlement. These pressures were partly offset by PPI initiatives delivered by each functional team across the company. Operating margin of 12.4% declined 201 basis points versus prior year adjusted operating margin. The effective tax rate was 23.7%, largely in line with last year's adjusted effective tax rate. Inventory ended the quarter at $18.2 billion, $1.3 billion lower than last year as we continue to optimize replenishment to align with sales patterns and improve the efficiency of spring product flow. Turning to capital allocation.\n In the first quarter, we generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow. Capital expenditures totaled $382 million as we continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We paid $633 million in dividends at $1.10 per share and repurchased 3 million shares for $743 million, returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders. We ended Q1 at adjusted debt to EBITDAR of 2.93x, and we delivered a return on invested capital above 32%. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, today, we are affirming our full year 2024 outlook. We continue to expect sales ranging from $84 billion to $85 billion and comparable sales in a range of down 2% to down 3% with Pro sales outpacing DIY.\n We expect operating margin in the range of 12.6% to 12.7% and full year earnings per share of approximately $12 to $12.30. To assist with your modeling, here are a few points to keep in mind for the cadence of the year. First, based on the trends we are seeing in the business, we expect second quarter comparable sales to be roughly in line with the first quarter. We continue to expect second half comp sales to improve as we cycle over easier compares from the DIY pullback that intensified in the third quarter of 2023. As I mentioned on our last call, this is not because we are forecasting an improvement in demand trends this year, it's just that the compares are easier in the second half.\n In terms of flow-through, we expect operating margin to remain under pressure in Q2, largely due to sales deleverage and cycling a favorable legal settlement. Taking these factors into account, we expect Q2 operating margin rate to be approximately 150 basis points below the prior year rate and flow through of productivity to improve in the second half of the year.\n Before I close, I'd like to reiterate that our capital allocation strategy remains intact. First, reinvest in the business; second, target a 35% dividend payout ratio and third, return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2024, we plan to use our free cash flow to repay a $450 million bond maturity and then return the remaining cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In closing, we remain focused on investing in our Total Home Strategy. As Marvin mentioned, we are also executing against a multiyear road map of PPI initiatives, which will continue to unlock productivity well beyond 2024. We are well positioned to capitalize on home improvement demand when the market recovers and continue to deliver sustainable shareholder value.\n And with that, we'll open it up for your questions. Yes, sure. This is Brandon. Thanks for the question. So as it relates to gross margins, and we look out for the full year, we are still expecting gross margins to be flat. Our improvements, mainly PPI, we expect those to be more back half weighted. The headwinds, we had many of these in Q1, ongoing investments in our supply chain as we finalize the rollout of market delivery, early investments in our Pro fulfillment initiatives, and spring promos as we continue to execute on our everyday competitive pricing strategy.\n And then the tailwinds, a number of PPI efforts that we continue to execute against, Bill mentioned momentum that we're seeing in private brands, ongoing pricing initiatives. And then as it relates to the callback, we're making really nice progress there. Driving sales now. We're making some of that investment in price, and there's going to be a bit of a lag defect as the new cost turn through inventory here over the next 3 quarters and then also continuing to benefit from lower transportation costs as we leverage our scale to drive rates with our carriers.\n So we also mentioned credit is some first half pressure there related to higher borrowing costs and delinquencies as it relates to our private label credit portfolio, but we expect to be able to manage that roughly flat to the year and then great performance on the shrink side. We continue to expect roughly flat on the year there. Yes. I think when we look at big ticket in particular, we continue to see pressure, right? We called out large tickets greater than [ 500 ], down 7.6% for the quarter. Most of that right now is still related to DIY, and we're continuing with the Q4 trends that we saw there where big ticket was down 8.8%. I think a lot of that is we look at discretionary. There is some seasonal impact there as we continue to see some level of pressure from patio, from grills with multiyear replacement cycles. We are continuing to see pressure from appliances as we normalize against the promo environment, we get back to more 2019 levels.\n And then also the emerging dynamic with the lock-in effect and higher rates continues to pressure big ticket categories like kitchen and bath, decor and flooring. And those are categories that are sensitive to higher interest rates and the new home occasion. So very much working through that. We're seeing offsets to that with as we continue to drive the Pro business. and that helps boost some of our big ticket. We expect that average ticket for the full year to continue to be roughly flat, but definitely continuing to work through some of the DIY pressures that we're experiencing. And Steve, I'll just add, you mentioned we're only 1/3 of the way through, but we're really pleased with the benefits that we're seeing. We're not going to call out the comps, but just financially speaking, seeing higher sales as we're opening up space on the front end, lower payroll costs, improved returns as we've increased or improved that experience and then the customer experience with the improved front end and BOPIS. So just as we look at all of our KPIs there, 1/3 of the way in, we're pleased with the progress there. Yes. Simeon, just as it relates to the macro first, we ultimately need to see customers, consumers reengage for us to have confidence that the home improvement is inflecting. We're watching for an uptick specifically on discretionary bigger ticket projects. I mentioned earlier what we're seeing. We're not seeing that at the moment. I think we're watching consumers continue to digest and adjust to the monetary tightening, which is working its way through the system, and that continues to have an outsized impact on housing where we see affordability challenges and historically low turnover.\n So again, we're not seeing that inflection point. Consumers continue to kind of remain on the sidelines. As Marvin mentioned, and we're waiting on that catalyst. We don't necessarily expect or understanding the timing of that. But just as it relates to the comp cadence, when we look at the second half, this is about the improvement in second half, not an improving macro, as I said in my prepared remarks. It's just easier year-over-year comparisons. And we looked at this in a number of different ways, tops down, bottoms up across multiple time frames. We've looked at DIY Pro categories and geographies, and we feel comfortable, was sort of the down [ 4 ] over the first half and moving back to a more historical mix of transactions and ticket as we start getting into the back half of the year. No, Simeon, I would say we've been fully committed to our long-term road map in terms of capital, major projects and PPI and top line growth initiatives still been fully committed to that. But we haven't pulled back at all. And as Marvin mentioned, we're investing in the business for the long term. Committed to the long-term trajectory and looking forward to comps starting to turn whenever that may be, and we believe kind of a long-term algorithm holds in place once that happens. Yes, Michael, I would just add, as Marvin said, we were really pleased with our ability to pivot our go-to-market strategy, especially as we saw customer behavior start to change over the back half of last year and our execution, our marketing approach, how we highlighted value, we believe, helped us win Q1, and we did see a little bit of margin pressure from those actions, but really pleased that we were able to manage that and offset that within SG&A and still deliver the bottom line number and I think confident that we can manage the portfolio as we move through the balance of the year.\n You mentioned we do expect some of these gross margin pressures to start to tail off as we move through the year in PPI to start to accelerate. So we're committed to delivering both the top line and the bottom line in line with our guide. Yes, Greg, this is Brandon. The majority of that's going to be traffic related. I think as I'll get the breakdown across the year on ticket and transactions, we're, for the most part, expecting average ticket to hold, consistent over the course of the remainder of the year just as we saw here in Q1, some slight pressure, ticket related, as we've shifted down in the smaller ticket seasonal projects, which has boosted transactions. And then we're also seeing continued ticket pressure, as I mentioned, from the DIY big-ticket discretionary and that includes some of the appliance promo pressure. But the flip side is, Pro growth continues to run strong for us, which is helping mix ticket up.\n And then as we look at really the second half of the year and the cadence improve, again, it's a function of really what we're cycling and we expect the transactions to start to pick up as we accelerate into the second half of the year, and we're going to see again, a much more historical relationship between ticket and transaction over the course of the second half of the year. I won't put a specific number on Q2, but we do expect Q2 to be similarly pressured with supply chain investments and some of the credit pressure that we're continuing to see. But for sure, as we get into the second half, we're seeing the improved -- the acceleration of PPI flow through with some of the supplier clawback cost out. There's some timing benefits that will come through in the second half of the year and then some of the credit pressures just start to ease. Again, that's a cycling, a timing issue as we started to see some of the interest rate pressures and delinquencies started to pressure in the second half of last year. So we expect that to smooth out as well. So that's sort of the shape of the curve there. Not significant at this point, just given the timing of when we scaled that. Seth, this is Brandon. Just one more thing. Just as you recall at the beginning of the year, we did plan for a much more normal spring season, and we had called out the last 2 years about a $400 million drag related to unfavorable weather in the last 2 years. So cycling against that. Some of that recovery moved into Q2 over the last couple of years. So that's also embedded into our outlook as we're looking at Q2 for this year. Peter, thanks for the question. This is Brandon. Just -- again, Marvin hit on this a bit, but our goals overall with the loyalty program are to create further stickiness with our DIY drive repeat visits and spend over time, our ability to get the data and drive more personalized marketing. Super pleased with what we're seeing with engagement from the customer standpoint and our associates. We're managing the enrollments to membership points redemptions.\n You mentioned sort of financially we're targeting effectively one more trip annually from our DIY customers. That's the revenue upside as we see it, and it's going to take some time to gauge success of that. So we're going to have to watch that play out over the course of the year. And then in terms of the overlay with the credit program, I mean, we are bundling and building on top of a 5% credit offer that we believe is best-in-class. It's going to continue to drive increased penetration there, and we think that value really resonates with the customer, and we're able to make that work financially. So we think it's a win-win there. Yes. And Jonathan, I would just add, consistent Pro outperformance across all of our regions. So really pleased with that. And then conversely, pretty much uniform ongoing pressure in DIY big-ticket discretionary. So that's been pretty broad-based on both the Pro side and the pressure and no real differences in what we're seeing across regions. Yes. Again, Jonathan, I think just on an absolute dollar performance standpoint, we're expecting more of the same in terms of what we saw second half. We don't have any macro improvement sort of embedded in. So from an absolute standpoint across these categories, we're expecting similar performance as we move through the year, but the comps should improve significantly in these categories just again based on what we're cycling and when we started to see the downturn in the second half of last year."

            "name": "Marvin Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Kate, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. First quarter sales were $21.4 billion with comparable sales down 4.1% from the same period last year. Despite the continued pressure in DIY big ticket discretionary spending across the industry, we delivered better-than-expected spring seasonal sales. Overall, we performed well in a challenging home improvement environment, as we adjusted our strategy to win the early spring customer and take share in key categories with data-driven marketing campaigns and our compelling seasonal assortment, which includes our industry-leading outdoor power equipment lineup strengthened by the launch of Toro. \n We also gained traction with our total home strategy reflected in our positive Q1 growth in Pro and online sales. In addition, we improved customer satisfaction while also maintaining a disciplined focus on our perpetual productivity improvement or PPI initiatives across all functional areas of the business. Overall, we're excited about our spring strategy, and we're pleased with how our SpringFest campaign resonated with customers, especially in smaller ticket lawn and garden projects. The combination of the right brands, compelling offers, strong store execution and more nimble marketing helped us capitalize on this key time of year. Bill and Joe will provide more detail on our spring and PPI efforts later in the call. Now turning to Pro. \n As I mentioned earlier, we delivered positive Pro comps in Q1 as our strategic investments to improve the Pro experience are driving increased sales and improved customer engagement. Specifically, investments to improve service levels as well as our expanded brand portfolio that now includes client tools are strengthening our relationships with this core customer. This customer has proven resilient as reflected in the recent Pro survey with healthy backlogs in line with last year. Our strategy continues to focus on taking share with the small- to medium-sized pros such as repair and remodel contractors, property managers and trace people. \n We estimate these Pros represent half of the $500 billion Pro market, which remains highly fragmented. We are striving to provide a high level of service with the small- to medium-sized pros as we continue to build trust and credibility. And we continue to invest in Pro growth, which includes expanding our capabilities to handle larger order delivery to the job site while also opening new Lowe's Pro supply branches around the country. There is still significant runway ahead of us to grow our sales with these customers while also leveraging our retail footprint to drive profitability. Now shifting to online. \n In the first quarter, online sales were up approximately 1%. Our ongoing improvement in our conversion rates in Q1 offset continued pressure in bigger ticket DIY categories. This quarter, we expanded our same-day delivery options of partnering with DoorDash and Shipt. Lowe's is the first home improvement retail partner on these platforms and their members now have quick and convenient access to wide assortment of home improvement products across the country. These new partnerships complement our existing same-day delivery options with Instacart in addition to our same-day delivery option on Lowes.com using our last mile partner OneRail. \n Our objective is simple, giving customers access to the home improvement products they need, however they choose to shop. And we're tailoring our digital experience to support the unique needs of different customer shopping journeys based on the type of project. And we're also using virtual and mixed reality to make it easier for customers to explore and visualize different possibilities for their home. Another exciting step forward for Lowe's this quarter was the national rollout of our DIY loyalty program called MyLowe's Rewards. This program is designed to reward customers for choosing Lowe's for the home improvement needs by earning points toward MyLowe's Money, providing free standard shipping as well as other offers and gifts. \n In addition, customers can also save 5% every day on eligible purchases with the MyLowe's Rewards credit card. As MyLowe's Rewards program matures, the purchase data will allow us to better understand the specific needs of each customer and tailor offers to their individual preferences. We're pleased with the early customer adoption and the successful launch, both in-store and online. And our frontline associates have also rallied around this campaign, and I'd like to thank them for their successful efforts to promote MyLowe's Rewards and educate our customers on the benefits. \n Now speaking of the team, we're excited to welcome the best soccer player in the world, Lionel Messi to our Lowe's home team lineup. We're also extending our reach to more sports fans beyond the football fans we connect with as the official home improvement retailer of the NFL. We're now striving to reach the 34 million soccer fans in the U.S. who are not NFL fans and we're excited by the rapid growth of soccer fans in the U.S. This exciting alliance along with our partnership with MLS Club Inter Miami CF and the Copa America 2024 USA tournament gives us the opportunity to build trust and credibility with a broader customer base. These partnerships will help us bring new customers to Lowe's and offer some unique experiences and rewards for these very passionate fans. \n Now I'd like to provide a quick update on our view of the macro. Uncertainty around interest rate cuts, stubborn inflationary pressures and a consumer still showing a preference towards spending on discretionary services and experiences continue to weigh on the DIY home improvement demand. And the outlook for lower mortgage rates and improved housing turnover remains uncertain. Real wage growth and home price appreciation are solid, but the home improvement customer is still on the sideline, expressing concerns about higher cost of living and the state of the overall economy. \n And while the near term is still challenging to read, we remain confident in the medium- to long-term outlook for our industry as our core demand drivers are all supportive of growth. Our continued commitment on our PPI initiatives, combined with our ongoing investments in our Total Home Strategy not only allow us to perform efficiently in this challenging macro environment, it also positions Lowe's for accelerated market share growth when the home improvement market recovers. \n Before I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our frontline associates for their continued hard work and commitment to Lowe's and to our communities. I've visited stores in 8 of our 15 geographic regions in the first quarter and our frontline associates are simply outstanding. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Simeon, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add is more of a broader theme that we're focused on. And that is managing through any unique challenges we're facing today. And I think Q1 reflects that we're executing at a high level in spite of some of the macro headwind that we're dealing with. But we're really positioning ourselves to really come out of this downturn as a much better company. We've invested billions of dollars in supply chain, IT infrastructure, our digital platform, our omni systems, store environment, merchandising assortments.\n And in other words, whenever the macro decides to turn, we're going to come out of it as a much stronger, more productive company. And so although we can't predict when that's going to happen, Brandon outlined our commitment to our capital allocation strategy, we're going to continue to invest, we're going to continue to make sure we prepare ourselves. And whenever the positive trends start to show up, we're going to be ready for it and we're going to take full advantage of it. Michael, I'll take the first part of that. This is Marvin, and I'll let Brandon give some additional perspective. I think Bill said it best. We're trying to meet the customer where the customer currently is at. And if the customer is looking for value, value does not always equate to low price, it equates to a great return for the dollar you spend. And so we feel really fortunate that we can make early investments in the customer with events and activities to win that early spring customer and still have an opportunity to outperform earnings per share and operating margin.\n And then as Brandon mentioned, we have initiatives in place that give us confidence that we'll roughly recover any gross margin decrement in the back half and in the year relatively flat. So we're going to be able to pull all the levers we have to make sure that we can aggressively serve the customer well. And we believe in a very simple philosophy, and that is during the spring season, if you win the customer early, you get multiple shopping occasions throughout the spring and the year and Bill and his team, along with great execution in the stores and the supply chain allowed us to do that. And so that's the overreaching philosophy, then I'll let Brandon give you more specifics on how we think about it for the balance of the year. Well, Mike, this is Marvin. We're not going to get into the specifics of the lift. But as I remind you and everyone, we launched the program in March. The initial focus was on enrollment, getting active members engaged, app downloads, and we're really pleased with how well it is going. The rollout was very smooth, and it really spotlights the benefits of really modernizing our store operating system. We could not have rolled this loyalty program out a year ago. because we were still in the process of retiring a 30-year operating system, which is now for all intents and purposes, behind us and the store associates engagement was simply tremendous in educating the customer and making sure that they were articulating the value.\n So our objective is just to simply take the data to serve our customers more effectively. Data is a new currency, but it's only beneficial if you use it to benefit the customer experience. We think we'll be able to do that. And we're also believing that we'll be able to get additional trips from the customer throughout the year. Is early, but we're pleased with the results, and we'll look forward to updating you and the external community throughout the year on the progress we're making. I'll take the first part, and then I'll hand it over to Bill. I mean this was broadly a weather dynamic from a standpoint of how the sales flow. We feel really good about the execution. We feel great about some of the initiatives with SpringFest and how the customers respond to it. But the cadence was really driven by the impact of weather to the initiatives. I'll let Bill kind of walk through some of the specific initiatives and how it played out in Q1. Well, I think overall, we're very pleased with the performance of our Pro strategy. As you know, it's been a 5-year investment journey on things like investing in job-like quantities for inventory, improving service levels, adding national brands, Bill and I, both mentioned the great performance of client tools, the #1 brand for electricians and HVAC professionals, bringing brands like that to the assortment, it just adds to the credibility of the turnaround that we've been on and trying to win some of these customers back from years past, in addition to a stronger digital platform, a great loyalty program that's resonating with the customers.\n And from the survey results that we shared, I mean, this is a resilient customer that continues to fight through the economic headwinds and their backlog is relatively equal to last year. So overall, that's driving it, whether or not we're taking share or not is, look, we don't want to determine that as much as we're just looking at internally at just much improved execution and results. And I'll let Joe talk a little bit about some of the other initiatives that were driving that. That we think is really resonating that allowed us to get this business back to positive. And Seth, I'd just close the Pro discussion with just one additional point. We're really focused on the customer that we can serve at a very high level and that's that small to medium Pro. And we estimate that's a [ $200 billion ] market opportunity. And so we are focused squarely on that customer. That customer still leverages the store. For fill in we can leverage the productivity of our existing real estate footprint to serve that customer well. We can do it without having to make dramatic investments in op expense in addition to the fulfillment capabilities, as Joe talked about. So we are very confident that our strategy is working and that is reflected in the results. We still have other investments to make, we'll make them, and we hopefully will continue to see this business head in the right direction in spite of a very difficult macro. Yes. I think the only comment I will make, Jonathan, is that our rural stores continue to be our best performing subset of stores within the overall geography and some of the initiatives that Bill's teams initiated with pet and apparel continue to perform really well in those locations, and we continue to evaluate the expansion of those categories in our rural environments. But overall, the West outperformed. As Brandon mentioned, Pro was widespread at a really strong performance. And the rural set of our stores kind of is the high watermark in performance among all geographic locations."

            "name": "William Boltz",
            "content": "Thanks, Marvin, and good morning, everyone. In spite of a challenging home improvement backdrop in Q1, we are pleased with our early spring sales as customers responded to our strong spring assortment and compelling offers. And our improved brand and service offerings resonated with our Pro customers, which led to positive broad-based Pro comps across all 3 geographic divisions. \n This year, our SpringFest strategy went more local than ever by using weather-triggered digital marketing as the spring season broke across different regions. In Q1, we also introduced sneak peaks for SpringFest, featuring doorbusters that were focused on driving traffic into our stores and online with targeted offers with seasonally relevant categories such as soils, mulch, and live goods. Winning the customer with these early seasonal purchases is important as they will often come back multiple times throughout the spring for the remainder of their outdoor project needs. Now turning to our results in hardlines. \n These marketing efforts, paired with the right brands and strong execution helped us deliver positive comp sales on a 1-year and 2-year basis in lawn and garden. Growth was driven by smaller ticket projects in landscape products and live goods, which resulted in increases in both comp sales and transactions in these categories. We are also pleased to be gaining traction with our own Sta-Green private brand, as customers have responded to the quality and the value offered in these lawn care products. And Sta-Green helps provide the consumer with a beautiful lawn and that they can be proud of at a price that won't break the bank. \n For the first time this spring, customers can also purchase select plants and live goods online and have them delivered through lowes.com. Garden products are already some of the most searched items on our website and now customers can conveniently shop for what they need and even order them from their backyard. And as Marvin mentioned, we are excited about our powerful new spring outdoor power equipment lineup as we introduced Toro to our lineup this year. \n Lowe's now offers the largest selection of Toro products of any national retailer with innovations like SmartStow, which allows owners to store their mower upright, reducing the storage footprint by up to 70%, including patented Briggs & Stratton technology, so it doesn't leak oil when stored in this position and with personal pace, a best-in-class self-propelled system that propels the mower at the speed the user is walking. We added these innovative Toro products to an already unmatched brand arsenal, which included EGO, SKIL, Cobalt, Husqvarna, CRAFTSMAN and John Deere. These strong brands helped us deliver positive comp sales in both gas and battery-powered walk behind lawn mowers as well as handheld outdoor power equipment. Now shifting gears to building products. \n Our Pro customers remain busy, which supported positive comps in building materials, with strength in roofing, concrete and block, drywall, and insulation, all helping to fuel that growth. Our added focus on inventory depth and improved in-stocks along with our localization efforts with tailored assortments to the market, continue to give Pro customers the confidence that Lowe's will have what they need to complete the job. Repair and maintenance categories such as water heaters, also continue to perform well, especially with innovative products like A.O. Smith's 120-volt plug-in heat pump water heaters. These Energy Star certified models plug into a standard wall outlet for easy installation and can save homeowners over $600 a year in utility bills compared to a standard electric water heater. \n In Electrical, we are pleased with the performance of client tools, the #1 tool brand for the electrical and HVAC professional. New products like the client circuit breaker finder, make it easy for electricians to quickly identify which breakers and outlets are connected to the breaker panel without turning the breaker on and off. The introduction and expansion of brands like client tools not only drive sales, it also allows us to rebuild the credibility with our Pro customers. \n Turning to home decor, where softer demand in DIY bigger ticket interior categories like flooring, kitchens and bath and appliances persisted. Trends in these categories were largely in line with the results we saw in the second half of last year. Our customers continue to look for value, especially given the persistent inflationary pressures. And our private brand products provide them with both value and style as they look to refresh their homes. Products like our allen + roth Harlow kitchen faucet, which is simple to install with 3 easy steps. And what is really unique, you don't have to go below the sink to install it. Our STAINMASTER PetProtect carpet with leak defense backing helps prevent spills and keeps pet accidents from seeping through to the rug pad or sub floor. STAINMASTER is the most trusted brand in carpet and is exclusive to Lowe's. Turning to appliances. \n We are expanding our market share as we continue to lead the industry with the broadest assortment, compelling values and fast and convenient delivery supported by our market delivery model, which creates a best-in-class fulfillment solution, including next-day delivery in most markets, which is an important option for a customer replacing a broken appliance. Average selling prices remain pressured as we cycle the reintroduction of pre-pandemic promotions across the industry as well as the continued slowdown in discretionary demand. Despite these near-term challenges, our appliance suppliers continue to improve selection with innovation and amazing new products. \n A great example is the Lowe's exclusive GE Freestanding Range with easy wash, a range with the first of its kind removable oven liner that is dishwasher safe, making for easy cleanup. Moving on to merchandising productivity. Our teams are continuing to execute against our extensive perpetual productivity improvement or PPI road map. This quarter, I'd like to highlight the productivity benefits of one initiative, the progress we've made in expanding our private brand penetration. \n The core focus of our private brand strategy is to offer our brand-agnostic DIY customers with style and quality at a great value. Not only do these products provide this for our customers. the product margin rates for our private branded products are typically significantly higher on average compared to the national brand counterparts. As we build out a compelling private brand portfolio from allen + roth decor products, and STAINMASTER products within flooring and paint to Sta-Green lawn care products to Cobalt tools, outdoor power equipment and storage solutions, we are delivering value to the DIY customer and productivity to the bottom line. \n As I close, I'd like to extend my appreciation once again to our vendors for their ongoing partnership, in particular, their support of our merchandising services team. Our 30,000 MST associates keep our shelves stocked, execute resets and enable our Red Vest associates to spend more time serving our customers. We allocate 100% of our MST funds into this program and are pleased with the impact it is having on our customer experience and associate productivity. And I'd also like to thank our merchants for their hard work and dedication as they navigate this dynamic macro environment. \n Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Joe. Yes, Steve, this is Bill. And so the trends we're seeing with appliances are very similar to what we've been seeing really over the last 6 to 12 months in that. We've seen the consumer shift from buying multiple pieces to now single item pieces really in that [ duress ] market. And so that's where we've pivoted our efforts to making sure that we're meeting her where she wants to be met. And we're really pleased that we've continued in a down market to be able to drive units and pick up unit share during that time frame.\n And so that's the efforts that you're going to see us drive as we go through Memorial Day and throughout the remainder of the year. And when you look at what the appliance team is doing, we're also seeing great innovation, as I called out in my prepared remarks with a GE oven that I talked about. But we've also talked about it before, you're seeing wherever we're putting innovation on the floor, you're seeing her respond to that type of product. And that's really the difference that's going on today. You've got a value-conscious consumer that is opting in and you've got a consumer that's not afraid to pay for innovation when that's offered to her as well. So we want to make sure that we meet or where she wants to be met. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. And Seth, I think the big difference for us this year is that we took a slightly different approach to our marketing. We -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we took a geo-targeted approach, which was really going south to north with our SpringFest campaign. And we put some offers out there that were seasonally relevant. We were able to target those south to north. And then we got a little bit of weather favorability that happened in March, and then we carried that into April. We're able to navigate some storm weather. We took advantage of that. But the teams did a really nice job of making sure that we had new products, new brands.\n We saw Toro really respond well for us. We continue to see EGO perform well. We continue to see anything that we've done, as I said earlier, in a question that was asked earlier around innovative products perform well. We've seen the consumer respond now with the weather advantages, the grass is growing. So they're out there buying zero-turn riding mowers. They're buying full-size gas grills. So we're seeing that work. And now we've got -- as we go into Q2, we've got Memorial Day, July 4, Father's Day in front of us. So we've got to take advantage of those events as we finish out the quarter. So those are really the results.\n And where we've had weather, we've seen it play in our advantage. And the lawn and garden team, as I said, had really nice results in the first quarter, driving that with traffic-driving events with soils, mulch, live goods and they took advantage of that customer that was out there getting their yard ready early in spring. So that was really the drivers. Yes, Peter, it's Bill. And so the promotional environment remains stable. And so nothing radically crazy. We're going to go similar to what we've been doing. We want to be seasonally relevant as we go into the back half of the year, obviously, we'll be out there as we go into fall with Labor Day. We're going to introduce Halloween. We're going to make sure that we're relevant with holiday and gift center and introduce and set our stores for spring in the Deep South for that December-January time frame. But we're going to make that transition.\n We're going to be relevant as the consumer comes out of those key seasonal categories, we'll make that transition into those fall seasonal categories, but there won't be anything goofy that will happen in the second half of the year. And so that's how we're going to approach it."

            "name": "Joseph McFarland",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by thanking our frontline associates for their hard work this quarter. Customer satisfaction scores were up 100 basis points over last year as we continue to improve our shopping experience for homeowners and pros while at the same time, driving productivity across our company. As we improve our customers' experience, we also remain focused on our associates' experience and our journey to become the employer of choice in retail.\n An example of our commitment to our associates was our decision to close our stores on Easter for the fifth consecutive year, giving our associates a well-deserved day off to spend with their loved ones, one of many ways we work to show our appreciation. We are seeing strong spring staffing levels and higher retention as we continue to invest in wages, associate development and internal mobility. And we have a best-in-class leadership development training program, including a store replicate at our Lowe's University training center, which gives store leaders hands on leadership practice and coaching.\n We have also implemented new weekly routines that help our department supervisors strengthen selling culture and skill set in their stores and prepare these leaders for their next step in their career. As a reminder, more than 80% of our store leadership positions were filled internally last year and nearly 90% of our store leaders started in hourly roles. Another way we are strengthening our selling culture is through our modernized store operating system, which is enabling our associates to close omnichannel sales from within our stores and help customers get everything they came for. So when a customer is looking for something out of stock or can't find the specific style they want in store, our associates can search our online assortment to find what they need and help them seamlessly check out an order that combines in-store and online items.\n Beyond supporting sales, our store teams remain laser-focused on driving productivity. A common misconception that we are hearing is that Lowe's must be nearing the end of our productivity journey given how much progress we've made in the last 5 years. This couldn't be further from the truth. Since this can be hard to see from the outside looking in, let me share some examples. First, we are only 1/3 of the way through our multiyear transformation of the front end of our stores, which includes our proprietary self-checkout registers, a significantly improved buy online pick up in store experience, a streamlined returns process and an optimized front-end selling space.\n Second, we have significantly reduced our return and cancellation rate through improved vendor partnerships, decreased damages and a clear and consistent returns process that's now systematically applied through enhanced technology. Third, we are also enhancing our shrink prevention ecosystem to maintain our best-in-class shrink performance including a new AI technology in partnership with NVIDIA that prompts customers to scan missed items during self-checkout. We're also piloting new product protection with a product security door that unlocks with the customer's phone number instead of needing to find an associate with a traditional key. These are just a few examples from our extensive road map of PPI initiatives.\n Given the strong performance of our frontline associates this quarter, 93% of our stores qualified for our Winning Together quarterly bonus, which is designed specifically for our hourly associates. As we approach Memorial Day weekend, I want to thank our veterans. As a marine, I'm proud of our company's long-standing commitment to supporting our military community. Lowe's ranks among the top military-friendly brands in the U.S. with a 10% off every day military discount, dedicated better than parking spots and nearly 26,000 associates from the military community.\n We work with Department of Defense to bring our jobs directly to transitioning service members and military spouses and have a program to provide training and work experience with Lowe's during their last months of service. We value the skills, dedication and courageous leadership we see in our veterans. In this Memorial Day, I hope you will join us in thanking our associates and camouflage vest for their service. In closing, we are executing to deliver an even better experience for our customers and associates, while unlocking even more productivity across our stores.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brandon. Yes. And so thanks for the question, Steve. I won't give the comp benefit, but there are several things that we're seeing. We have a detailed road map as we've laid out. We're 1/3 of the way through. And when I think about the proprietary self-checkout systems we talked about in the past, the user-friendly for the home improvement customer along with the partnership we have with our tech team under Seemantini's leadership, the teams work hand-in-hand. So we're incorporating the technology that we spoke about, NVIDIA, our assisted self-checkout. And in addition, we just finished launching the ability for our gig drivers to pick up from our enhanced buy online pickup in store and all of our gig delivery network. So we're really pleased. And again, third of the way through customer satisfaction scores have improved, the associate engagement has improved and very pleased with where we're at. Yes. Thanks, Marvin. Seth, as you think about some of the investments that we've made, Marvin has called them out, Bill has called them out. Job-like quantity, safety stock, but also our enhancement in our job site delivery for larger orders. If you think about the maturity of our loyalty program in Pro, our CRM program, or growing share of wallet. We continue to expand our Lowe's Pro supply. And then from the survey that Marvin had mentioned, the dimensions of the [ health ], we look at backlogs and materials, credit, labor and the project type. The Pros have been stable and steady there. And so we're pleased with the gains we're making with this customer, both in-store, product-wise and online. Peter, to add on Brandon quickly. We're pleased with the first kind of loyalty perk that we rolled with Mother's Day, the engagement we had with the members and new members as well as our associates and our ability to gain incremental loyalty members. And so as an early example there, the Mother's Day engagement, we're very pleased with. Jonathan, this is Joe. Thank you for the question. From a geographic standpoint, as we said, where we've seen great weather, we've seen great performance. But from an overall and geographical standpoint, our West is our best performance for Q1."
