I will now turn the call over to Dean Banks.\nDean Banks: Thank you, Jon and many thanks to everyone listening for their interest in Tyson Foods. We hope you are all safe and healthy as we continue to navigate the pandemic. I am thankful for the efforts of everyone, of Tyson\u2019s nearly 140,000 team members and wants you to know their health and safety remain our top priority. The dedication of our team members and the future of our business have me excited to be in my first earnings call as CEO. We have an exceptional leadership team with tremendous experience across protein production, consumer insights, innovation, technology and more and I am truly excited about the growth and success we will drive as a team. We have recently faced unprecedented and unfamiliar times, but our business is settling down and we are uniquely positioned to fulfill our long-term strategy. Our business performed well and delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results. Our team members, agricultural partners and customers have shown resilience. This has enabled us to maintain and accelerate our efforts to provide global consumers with a safe and accessible food supply. Before we talk about fourth quarter results, I would like to cover our team\u2019s accomplishments over the last 12 months. At the onset of the pandemic, we launched an internal task force to address the virus. We made substantial investments in our personal protective equipment, social distancing safeguards and other increased health and safety measures across our business. We have seen a dramatic reduction in active cases involving our team members since last spring. In an effort to stay ahead of the virus, we have launched a new industry leading monitoring strategy that involves weekly testing of a sample of team members, which has so far proven to be invaluable. We had $540 million in direct incremental COVID-19 costs for the full year, including about $300 million of Thank you bonuses and other benefits paid directly to our team members for their efforts. We managed core expenses aggressively in an effort to partially offset the increased costs related to COVID-19. Our Beef and Pork segments both delivered a strong performance on the year while Prepared Foods showed positive momentum, including a continuation of share gains across many retail categories. Our core retail lines grew volume in every quarter of the fiscal year, up over 17% during the latest 52 weeks. Our chicken business is still performing below our long-term earnings expectations. While our Tyson frozen value-added and premium air-chilled products have performed strongly, other businesses have not. The biggest drivers of our underperformance are not having full staffing levels, a portion of which can be attributed to the ongoing effects of the coronavirus, operational execution and pricing. The majority of our improvement opportunity lies in reducing the mix and yield impacts of the three drivers I just mentioned and most of this is centered in a handful of our plants. The inefficiencies driven by reduced staffing levels and poor execution has translated to higher cost per pound. We expect progress toward these issues to face headwinds from absenteeism and other COVID-19 related complexities during the first half of the year. I remain hopeful that a vaccine and a gradual return to normalcy in the second half will result in a net improvement for the year. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to sustainable business practices and corporate social responsibility. Our efforts included the following: enhancing our framework to promote equity, inclusion and diversity in the workplace, including $5 million in committed donations to organizations that are advancing the cause of lasting change; our work to verify sustainable cattle production practices on more than 5 million acres of grazing land in the largest beef transparency program in the U.S.; record protein donations across the country; and the development in recently announced Forest Protection Standard to reassert that we have virtually no deforestation risk across our global supply chain. In the alternative protein space, we bolstered the company\u2019s offerings under the Raised & Rooted brand, while extending our retail presence to 10,000 stores in less than a year, entering the quick-service restaurant channel and launching products in Europe. Over the past year, we have seen our plant-based offerings\u2019 retail sales increase over 250% and we are excited to build on this momentum alongside our customers as we meet evolving consumer demand for years to come. Now, let\u2019s discuss some high level takeaways from our fourth quarter. In the U.S., the pandemic continue to drive higher levels of retail demand and overall lower levels of foodservice volume. While quick-service restaurants are close to or better than pre-COVID levels, full service restaurants continue to operate at about 80% of normal with wide variations by geography, while schools and cafeterias are operating at levels significantly below normal. These channel impacts, as well as higher levels of absenteeism, increased the cost and complexity of our operations. Europe has a similar operating environment as the U.S., while our Asian businesses are almost back to normal. The continued strength of at-home consumption is driving historically high retail and e-commerce sales and Tyson is winning. Our retail core business lines experienced their ninth straight quarter of share growth and continue to outperform the top 10 food manufacturers. Volumes in these lines were up nearly 15% during the latest 13 weeks, leading to nearly 2 percentage points in volume share growth during that period. As consumers increasingly shifted towards little or no contact buying methods during the pandemic, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 99% on a full year basis and 126% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. With this growth, Tyson\u2019s online sales penetration through its e-commerce channel partners is now estimated at over $1 billion and we expect continued relevance of this channel moving forward. The company experienced solid results during the fourth quarter driven by strong operating income performances in our Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods businesses. The performance of these segments offset lower results in our chicken business. In total, we delivered almost $1 billion of operating income for the fourth quarter in spite of the negative impacts of $200 million associated with COVID-19. This represents an operating income improvement of $275 million versus Q4 of 2019, an increase of almost 40%. Our Prepared Foods business delivered strong Q4 results. Our brands and products continue to resonate with consumers as demonstrated by our track record of share growth, nine quarters in a row. We have a balanced mix of distribution channels, giving us a resilient business model that\u2019s able to effectively react to external factors, including obstacles caused by COVID-19. Improved operational execution as well as lower commercial spend, also helped to drive strong Q4 results. We are also pursuing SKU rationalization and optimization opportunities across our production network. Our beef and pork businesses continue to be an important part of our company\u2019s portfolio strategy. They generated very strong returns during the quarter, enabling investments in key value-added and international growth initiatives across our business. The Beef segment delivered solid earnings as the cut-out margin remained strong, while live cattle prices driven by plentiful supplies remained relatively low. This was set against the backdrop of continued strong consumer demand. Our operational performance recovered substantially from the early COVID-19 impacts and volumes were up 31% versus the third quarter. Exports have also been strong for our Beef segment, which serve as a way for us to optimize all parts of the animal, including products that aren\u2019t traditionally consumed within the American diet. We expect to see continued adequate cattle supplies during fiscal 2021. The Pork segment also delivered very strong earnings during the quarter, despite a narrowing of the spread as hog costs increased and the cut-out came down. The hog supply remained strong, while our plants faced less disruption and produced significantly improved volumes versus Q3. The plentiful conditions we have seen in the hog supply are beginning to moderate as a result of the industry\u2019s ongoing recovery, but we expect adequate supplies in the near-term. In an effort to support the independent hog farmers who rely on us for consistent and reliable outlet for their livestock, we have worked hard to safely maximize our processing capacity. African swine fever has persisted overseas moving into Germany\u2019s wild boar population. This infection quickly led to certain nations banning German pork exports, which we expect to create incremental global demand for U.S. pork. We are beginning to see some level of herd rebuilding in China, but we agree with industry analysts that a complete recovery may depend on eradication of ASF and/or the success of a commercial grade vaccine. Our view is that full recovery could still be a multi-year event. Until this occurs, we expect to see a continued redistribution of global pork supplies. Within the U.S., export demand has increased at a pace that has helped to offset increased pork supplies domestically. This demand has been supportive of hog prices, which is critical for U.S. independent hog farmers. Our Q4 chicken results improved sequentially compared to the third quarter as we saw some recovery in our operations and experienced lower COVID-19 costs. However, the results were not better than our prior year as a number of the challenges which I outlined earlier are still with us. Having said that, we have seen tremendous performance within our branded retail value-added poultry lines, including more than 24% volume growth during the quarter with simultaneous volume and dollar share gains. The impacts of COVID-19 on channel volumes and operating efficiency resulted in net negative volumes for the quarter and higher operating costs. We also saw a dramatic softening of the late quarter market during the quarter, which has since leveled out. As I mentioned, we are aggressively executing a variety of operational and supply chain efficiency programs to better position us for long-term competitiveness. Additionally, we are continually identifying ways to drive costs out of our structure, while remaining keenly focused on operational improvements and customer service. As COVID-19 related absenteeism rates have improved, although not yet back to historical levels, we are focused on the operational improvement programs mentioned in fiscal 2020. We still believe the original target of $200 million in cost savings as a result of these improvement initiatives is attainable. Our international portfolio continues to give us great opportunities for growth and synergy. Our view remains that the vast majority of global protein consumption growth will happen outside of the U.S. So we are positioning our company to meet that need. During the last quarter, we found new, profitable international outlets for U.S. based byproducts that would otherwise realize relatively low values domestically. By leveraging our U.S. based scale with our newly acquired and legacy international businesses, we have identified repeatable opportunities to margin up bulk export products into a convenient value-added and retail-ready format for international markets. The benefit of these value-added sales, which originate in our domestic business and are sold throughout our international network, is an example of how our One Tyson approach helps us meet global demand while enhancing the company\u2019s margin structure. We will continue to seek out and leverage these and other synergistic opportunities across our global network as we expand abroad and continue to learn from consumers in these growing markets. We also recently announced our plans to build new production capacity in China and Thailand as well as expansion of our facility in the Netherlands. These initiatives will add substantial fully-cooked poultry capacity to our network, which will help us serve emerging markets and strategic customers. And last, we plan to accelerate our focus on initiatives to ensure a competitive cost structure moving forward, which includes optimizing organizational structures and other cost reduction activities. In summary, I am pleased by our fourth quarter performance and I am excited about our future. I would now like to turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our Q4 financial performance and fiscal 2021 financial outlook.\nStewart Glendinning: Thank you, Dean. As previously mentioned, our business performed well during Q4 and the full fiscal year, especially considering the external challenges facing our company. Now, please keep in mind that Q4 was a 14-week quarter because of the 53-week fiscal year, which is reflected in our GAAP results. The quarterly and annual adjusted results that we refer to throughout have the impact of the additional week removed for comparability purposes. We delivered operating income of $961 million during the quarter, up almost 40% versus Q4 \u201819 and $3.1 billion for the full year, up almost 5% versus last year, leading to a total company return on sales of 7.4%, up about 40 basis points versus last year. This strong performance resulted in a $1.81 of EPS for the quarter, an increase of approximately 50% versus Q4 \u201819 and $5.64 for the full year, up about 3% versus fiscal 2019. This performance was predicated on our flexible crushed protein portfolio that has shown great resiliency during recent periods of disruption to our industry and economy. Our Q4 results include a $75 million positive derivative impact, although on a full year basis, derivative values were relatively flat. We also incurred $200 million of direct COVID-19 costs during Q4 as we continue to prioritize team member health and safety and those costs have not been adjusted out of our results. The reactions from our team members to the investments and initiatives we have implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have been resoundingly positive. Sales and volumes were both lower by about 2% versus Q4 \u201819 driven primarily by the effects of COVID-19, including reduced sales through the foodservice channel. Return on sales for the aggregate business came in at 9% for Q4 and average sales price was down less than 1% versus Q4 \u201819. Jumping into the specific segment results, our Prepared Foods segment delivered strong performance, including operating income of $236 million or 11.2% return on sales. Sales were down 1.8% and volumes were down 5.6% versus the comparable period as a result of retail strength offset by COVID-19 related weakness in foodservice. Operating income improvements were driven by reduced commercial spending, lower commodities and operational improvements, including the benefits of lower write-downs versus last year. The Chicken segment delivered operating income of $91 million, generating a 2.9% return on sales. These results include a $45 million gain from derivative adjustments during the quarter. Sales were down 7.5% and volumes were 5.4% lower versus the comparable period last year, driven in large part by the effects of COVID-19, including lower foodservice volumes. We were impacted by both channel shift as well as operational issues resulting from the pandemic. As Dean outlined in his prepared remarks, we continue to face challenges in our Chicken segment, but remain committed to take the actions necessary to return us to top quartile performance. Beef segment operating income was $483 million during the quarter, generating a return on sales of 12.2%. Sales were up 2.7% and volumes were up 3.8% versus Q4 \u201819 driven principally by the lower comparable figures last year due to lower production capacity as a result of the fire at our Finney County processing facility. We don\u2019t anticipate these levels of profitability to persist into the remainder of fiscal 2021, but still expect the Beef business to deliver strong results going forward. Pork operating income was $162 million in the fourth quarter, representing a return on sales of 12.8%. Sales were up 1% and volumes were up almost 7% versus the comparable period last year driven primarily by strong consumption of pork products in both domestic and international markets. Gross margin and volume improvements completely offset higher operating costs to deliver year-over-year adjusted operating income growth of $135 million. Our international business, as Dean mentioned, continues to demonstrate great growth and synergy prospects. This business has now been profitable for the past 2 years, which sets the stage for strong future performance. We will continue to focus on growth opportunities and seek out additional synergy opportunities using our \u201cOne Tyson\u201d framework to increase the value of our international output across the portfolio. Moving on to broader financial performance highlights. Year-to-date operating cash flows were $3.9 billion on a 53-week basis. Our balance sheet and leverage ratios continue to strengthen, driven by gross debt de-leveraging and an increasing liquidity position as a result of strong cash flows. We repaid almost $700 million of bond maturities during the quarter and our ending liquidity, which was higher than we would have originally anticipated, due to strong operating cash flows, was $3.2 billion. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended at 2.3x, which included the negative effects of our direct COVID-19 costs. Net interest expense totaled $123 million during the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter and weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 364 million. Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter came in at $292 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $316 million. Our crushed protein portfolio strategy provides us with a counter-cyclical effect during periods of weakness in specific protein markets. This differentiated capability allows us to both grow and stabilize the company\u2019s aggregate earnings over time, and has contributed to a strong annual operating CAGR over time. Our base protein businesses have continued to generate strong returns and cash flows that will fuel our value-added and international growth into the future. And finally, last week, our Board approved an increase to our annual dividend of $0.10 per share. This increases our annual dividend to $1.78 per share. I\u2019d now like to walk through our financial guidance as we look ahead into the balance of fiscal 2021. About halfway through our first quarter and our businesses are off to a good start. We expect annual revenues of $42 billion to $44 billion. With our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, we expect CapEx spending of between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. The majority of this spending will be toward previously announced capacity additions in our Beef, Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses, as we focus on strategic organic growth plans. We expect to manage liquidity in excess of our historical target of $1 billion, and we will continue to focus on de-leveraging with over $500 million of notes maturing during the fiscal year. Our effective tax rate is expected to approximate 23%. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $440 million. COVID costs are expected to be lower on a run rate basis than the fourth quarter, although, we expect PPE and employee-related payments, amongst other costs, to continue while COVID infections remain active. Although it\u2019s still very early and a host of factors could impact the accuracy of our assumptions, including the duration of the pandemic, we\u2019re currently anticipating approximately $330 million of COVID costs for the fiscal year. I want to stress that this is a point-in-time estimate, based on what we know currently, and the health and safety of our employees is our top priority. Some of the direct costs we\u2019ve experienced as a result of COVID-19 have been transient, while others could be structural, specifically regarding team member wages in certain production locations. Because of this, we expect some increased labor costs as we strive to attract and retain talent in the competitive labor markets where we operate. This competition for labor is not only with other meat processes, but with a range of companies hiring similarly skilled people. As 2021 progresses, we will have a better sense of which costs are likely to continue over the longer term. Our new plant in Humboldt will commence operations this year and, as is normal with plant startups, we will incur substantial ramp-up costs. Despite the challenges we\u2019ve experienced, our countercyclical multi-protein business model across brands, channels, categories and geographies, puts us in a good position as we orient our portfolio toward future growth. As Dean mentioned, we are proud of our team\u2019s accomplishments during the fourth quarter and are excited about how our performance sets us up for the balance of fiscal 2021. Our balance sheet liquidity, scale and portfolio of businesses differentiate Tyson from other food companies and position us for long-term growth as we execute against our strategic plan with a constant focus on maximizing long-term shareholder value. I would like to now turn the call back over to Dean to discuss broader fiscal \u201821 business outlook and closing remarks. Dean?\nDean Banks: Thank you, Stewart. We have a bright future ahead and we remain committed to navigate the risks and market based factors that we may face, especially in the current environment. We will prepare for, and respond to those risks to the best of our ability just as we have always done. With respect to our view on the business and operating environment, as we look ahead into the balance of fiscal 2021, we expect consumption behavior will continue to orient towards meals at home. Unless the current wave causes widespread shutdowns, we would expect to see a continuing gradual recovery in foodservice volume throughout the year. This is, of course, dependent on the extent of the pandemic spread within our communities, the broad availability of a vaccine and any local or federal regulatory restrictions. As we look across our businesses, we are evaluating where we can utilize automation and technology in our work that will enable more efficient and effective collaboration and operations. Grain futures for 2021, has strengthened recently due to diminishing U.S. production prospects from earlier in the season and record high demand in China. Prices have been further supported by unfavorable weather and competing crop producing countries and could result in overall grain costs being higher for 2021. Remember, our previous guidance that a $0.10 per bushel move in corn or a $10 per ton move in soybean meal translates to an approximately $25 million change to cost of goods sold. The trade environment continues to present uncertainty, especially considering this year\u2019s elections and the potential implications that may have on trade policy. We recently observed higher freight costs due to limited driver availability and mix-related load and efficiencies that are exploring opportunities to mitigate and offset this trend. This is in addition to the challenges we mentioned earlier around ensuring full staffing in our plants. Beef and Pork segment margins are expected to moderate toward more historical levels as industry capacity, live animal supplies and finished goods inventories equilibrate, although we still expect these businesses to generate healthy returns. At the same time, we expect stronger performances from our Prepared Foods and Chicken businesses as we sharpen our focus on cost reduction and operational improvement. We also expect that when the virus recedes, our ability to drive business improvements will accelerate. In closing, our business performed well during an unprecedented time. Our team displayed resilience when consumers, more than ever, needed access to a stable and accessible food supply. While we will continue to face pandemic-related challenges in fiscal 2021, we are settling the business down to be focused on executing our long term strategy of generating strong returns for shareholders. I am excited for the opportunities ahead for this great company, and I am certain, we have the people, products and strategies in place to drive future growth. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we\u2019re ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, good morning, everybody.\nDean Banks: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Goldman: Dean, you were quoted in the media yesterday regarding your COVID prep and you talked a little bit about it today. I did just want to clarify a little bit. Just given how quickly the virus is spreading, how do you think about how do you prepare for increased risks of labor shortages in the next couple of months, not just because of actual illness, but also because of workers may be afraid of getting a little sick? And I guess on a tangential note, are you seeing any short-term demand upticks for your products as consumers maybe pull some orders forward a little bit?\nDean Banks: Sure, Ken. First and foremost, our team member safety has been our top priority and we have taken a tremendous amount of forward-looking action to make sure that we are prepared so that when they come into work everyday, they not only feel safe but they look around and see variety of precautions that we have taken to protect them. So, you have seen some announcements that we have made around hiring of nurses in our facilities. That was in anticipation of what we are seeing today and for fear that, that actually could manifest itself. We have posted a position for Chief Medical Officer, which we are close on. And I would say that the most important aspect of our preventative measures was this has been, how we have acted upon the availability of testing with what we are calling our always-on testing strategy where we are sampling team members as they come in and making sure that we can identify what\u2019s going on both in the public numbers and the community, but also what we are seeing from our team members coming into the plants and that\u2019s just been tremendously invaluable and getting them comfort that they are not at risk of catching anything. And then I would say that it\u2019s also been invaluable to the communities in which we operate. You might have seen an article that came out a few weeks ago in Storm Lake, where a former state health official cited that the county in which we operate actually had lower COVID numbers and she attributed that to how we are acting with our monitoring and testing strategy, much like we anticipated the need for masks early in the first wave of the crisis and chartered a plane to take proactive aggressive action to get precaution for our team members \u2013 precautionary protections for our team members. I\u2019d say, in this crisis, we have been \u2013 in the second wave, we have been preparing all along and you can see that in our expenses. From a demand perspective \u2013 from a demand labor perspective, from a labor perspective, I would say that we, as Stewart mentioned in his comments, we have been bonusing our team members and just saying thank you. We know that they have options for where they go and we want Tyson Foods to be a place where they can come to work and thrive everyday.\nKen Goldman: Okay, thank you for that. That is clear. And then quick follow-up from me, you are well into the first quarter already. I know you are hesitant to talk about 2021 for understandable reasons. But is there anything we can understand maybe even directionally about how the quarter is progressing so far? Are there any unusual factors we should consider when we model just so we kind of avoid any surprises or any unnecessary surprises, so to speak?\nDean Banks: Yes, we are not going to be able to preannounce or anything like that. But what I would say is that we are expecting beef and pork to ultimately, through 2021, normalize. I would say, when you are thinking about those two businesses, specifically, from a pork perspective, hogs are coming in at weight now, so we think we have worked through some portion of the backlog, while there may still be some out there. We do expect adequate supplies through the year. In beef, cattle are still coming in quite a bit overweight and so we are seeing that there is quite a bit of backlog and ample supply certainly for the year to come. Chicken, as you have seen through the reports, we are aggressively pursuing operational improvements and you have seen the leadership change we have made there, about complementing Chad Martin and his exceptional leadership with Donnie King, who is an industry veteran leading the business. That\u2019s going to take some time. Recovering chicken is going to be a long effort. We have got a handful of plants that are just not operating operational efficiently. And then the variability related to the crisis and what\u2019s happening in foodservice in some of those plants is just continuing to make that challenging, but we are working hard to make the operational improvements we need. And Prepared Foods has been performing strong. We are very proud of the work that they are doing there. And much like the other parts of the business, we really need foodservice to come back online for that business to be everything that we know it can, but the ability of the team to flex between retail and foodservice has been phenomenal.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thank you so much.\nDean Banks: No problem.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nBen Theurer: Yes, thank you very much, Dean, Stewart, good morning and congrats on the results.\nDean Banks: Thanks, Ben.\nBen Theurer: So the first question, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the outlook for 2021, just following up Ken\u2019s question. Obviously, there is a lot you cannot preannounce, but just to understand a little bit the dynamics, because it seems like your sales guidance at least looks for something like slightly negative to maybe 3.5% to 4% in growth on an adjusted basis. So, that looks rather cautious if we just consider the significant decline we had in the third quarter of 2020 and your fiscal quarter. So, is that really because you still think there is a lot of headwind in foodservice from COVID? So just to elaborate a little bit on the dynamics and in terms of top line amongst the different segments, that would be much appreciated?\nDean Banks: Yes. Ben, I would love to be able to give you some guidance, but as you have seen, if we have started giving any direction a month and a half ago, they have been wrong. The COVID impacts and increases are continuing with shutdowns both in our domestic and in some international markets. And we are just not able to \u2013 we are not able to guide at this point.\nBen Theurer: Okay. And then my second question if you could just quickly go into the chicken segment and the operating inefficiencies, if you want to call it that way. Where do you think you stand on addressing those? And you said just moments ago that this will take obviously time, but how do you think about the progression and the way to address those inefficiencies? Just putting for a moment aside, COVID, I know there is a lot of uncertainty around it. But if that would not be a headwind, how do you feel about the ability to address those inefficiencies and get those operating margins into a more reasonable level just by what is in your hands to be addressed?\nDean Banks: I won\u2019t be able to give a ton of specifics, but as you know, we have put out guidance before that we were going after about $200 million in operational improvements in the chicken business before the crisis. And as we reported, we were making good progress on that. And then as you rightly point out, COVID really affected quite a bit of that. We are still making improvements everyday. Our leaders are in our plants looking for inefficiencies and looking for the ways that we can get those plants running full again and back on track. But as far as recovering that full $200 million, there will be some value in the recovery from COVID in foodservice and getting our plants back up to full operational capacity. But we are not waiting on that much like you have seen in the past, the shift from foodservice to retail. We have done that where we can. We have also maintained flexibility to support our fast growing QSR partners who are even surpassing their original sales with their progress in drive-thru and take-out. And so it is going to take some resolution in COVID for us to really make the growth and expansion there we want, but we are not waiting for that. We are taking aggressive steps as we speak.\nStewart Glendinning: Ben, it\u2019s Stewart. Just one other thing just to add to that, I mean, look, the good news here is the teams are razor sharp on what needs to be done to move that business to first quartile. One thing just to keep in mind from the modeling and I mentioned in my comments is that Humboldt will come online later this year. That\u2019s great. It\u2019s going to give us more capacity, but it will come with some increased costs and you could think for modeling purposes, that\u2019s going to be a little less than $100 million, probably more weighted to the back half of the year than to the front, but it\u2019s a meaningful number.\nBen Theurer: Okay. That was very helpful. Thank you very much, Stewart and Dean. Thanks. Congrats. I\u2019ll leave it here.\nDean Banks: Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Hi, there. Can you hear me okay?\nDean Banks: We can, Alexia. Go ahead. Thank you.\nAlexia Howard: Perfect, okay. Can I ask about you mentioned the trends on the foodservice side of the business with the QSRs doing pretty much business as usual and then full service restaurants only operating at 80% and schools, etcetera are pretty hard hit. Can you give us an idea of how your foodservice sales breakdown in each of those channels just so that we can get an idea of how exposed you are to each of those trends? And then I have a follow-up.\nDean Banks: No, we are not going to be able to break those down anymore specifically. I would even cite just so you read of the situation that some of our QSR partners are actually surpassing previous volumes, which is really exciting to see for them and that\u2019s changing quite dynamically. So, we won\u2019t be able to give any additional direction related to how that breaks down.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Alexia, best data I can give you is suggest that you take a look at the 10-K which we filed this morning. If you go back in the segment data there, you will find some breakout, maybe not quite what you are asking for, but it will be \u2013 at least give you a sense of what went through foodservice last year and what\u2019s going through there now, about $1 billion lower on a $12 billion. Keep in mind also when you look at that data, that\u2019s 53-week data for \u201820 and not 52-week data.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. I will go take a look. And secondly, you did feature the plant-based part of the portfolio in the prepared remarks and you mentioned I think 10,000 outlets on the retail side plus getting into the QSR channel as well. Can you give us an idea of how large that business is? I know, it was only launched last summer, so it\u2019s early days, but some idea of how big it is and what the momentum looks like right now on that part of the business. Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.\nDean Banks: Yes, I\u2019ll comment on the word momentum. It\u2019s got quite a bit of momentum. We have \u2013 some of the SKUs are really surpassing expectations related to velocity. And as you saw, we\u2019ve expanded to a significant number of retail stores. You may have also seen the announcement just recently that we are kicking off a pilot with Jack in the Box. We\u2019re thrilled about that and our progress there in a variety of prospects with the business. We\u2019ll not give any specifics on the size, but we\u2019re thrilled with the investment and the momentum that we\u2019ve had.\nAlexia Howard: Great, thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nDean Banks: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nDean Banks: Good morning, Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Dean, just given your comments yesterday and some of the comments today around COVID, with cases climbing, I guess, one of the concerns is that plants are remaining open at this point because of the current administration\u2019s executive order. So I guess the first part of the question is, have you had any discussions with the incoming administration about making sure that that maintains in place? And the second part of that is there any discussion going on at the higher level, so making sure that as these vaccines become available, that your frontline workers are kind of first in line to receive the vaccine just to maintain the supply chain?\nDean Banks: So I\u2019ll stress one thing that we\u2019ve really put team member safety first and as you saw through the previous waves, we have taken no hesitation to idle plants, whenever we think it\u2019s the right thing to do to either do deep cleaning or mass testing or whatever was required. And so in this crisis, we are taking as many precautions as possible to make sure we\u2019re keeping our team members safe and that results in them feeling safe coming to work and that results in us being able to keep our plants up and running and feeding the world. Related to vaccine availability, look, it\u2019s too early to push forward and what that could ultimately look like. You have to consider distribution, obviously, side effect profile and a million other things when thinking about how that\u2019s going to ultimately impact your business. And from a broader perspective, our business is operating through this climate very well. What I would say is that, whether it\u2019s our balanced portfolio, whether it\u2019s the protections that we\u2019ve taken, the business has proven extraordinarily resilient, and we\u2019ve heard from really every administration that they consider companies like Tyson and industries, specifically around food, to be mission-critical for the country. And I\u2019m sure that if the vaccine is proving to be effective and safe and our team members decide that they want it for their own protections, then it will be made available.\nPeter Galbo: Okay. Now, that\u2019s very helpful. And Stewart, maybe just the comments that you made on freight and grain, I know that kind of the hedges you had in place in \u201820 on chicken were disadvantageous from a grain perspective. But just as grain has moved up, how should we think about those reversing into a more positive position if you\u2019re more advantageously hedged? Thanks very much, guys.\nStewart Glendinning: Guys, I mean, we\u2019ve got some detail on our K. I think the best thing to do is just to think broadly about the stats I gave you earlier for the following reason. I think the stats, I gave you sort of $0.10 on corn is $25 million $10 on soybean per ton is $25 million. So look at those. We\u2019ve got more detail on the K. We ought to think about hedging and sort of ultimately following the basic trend. I mean, it\u2019s going to create a lag. So as grain prices go up, our hedging will operate in such a way as to slow that increase in our numbers, but then you\u2019ll get the opposite on the other side. So think about the curve, I mean, the curve that is distinctly upward, certainly, in the last month or so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDean Banks: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi. So, I guess, first, I want to come back to something like that mentioned in the prepared remarks and alluded to in one of the answers and it was taking \u2013 the idea of taking the Chicken business back to top quartile performance. And you \u2013 we can look at your \u2013 some of your public peers and kind of evaluate that, but there\u2019s also meaningful mix differences in your business, given kind of your differences in bird class, the big prepared, kind of, fully-cooked operation that you have. So I\u2019m just trying to think about how \u2013 as you would define top quartile performance in your Chicken business, given your mix, what does that actually mean?\nDean Banks: Yes, it\u2019s certainly a good question, Adam. I\u2019d say our businesses, specifically in Chicken, as you pointed out, it\u2019s very mixed. So our retail value-added portfolio has performed just phenomenally through the crisis, up north of 24%. We\u2019ve been thrilled with the market share gains there. And the other aspects of our business, whether it\u2019s tray pack or fresh or small bird, they\u2019re all competing and all being impacted in very different ways. Specifically, some of our business has been very strongly hit by daily sales being down through the crisis. And so we watch performance really on a business unit by business unit basis and some of the businesses that have been impacted, specifically the plants, due to mix and operational efficiency, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about in getting back up to top quartile performance on those that are underperforming in each of their given segments. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to give any more specific guidance than that.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. And then I wanted to just \u2013 trying to wrap up some of the comments on fiscal \u201821 a little bit, just go through some of the different pieces. So if I\u2019m reading the guidance right, about $210 million of tailwinds today on COVID costs but that could change, $100 million or so of incremental costs related to Humboldt. If I would look at grain today, I would look at \u2013 take the sensitivity that you just gave, Stewart, and I would think that\u2019s at least $150 million on a gross basis. Now, I know your pricing comps some of that, but gross $150 million or so. And then the freight, I didn\u2019t catch the number in terms of what the headwind was. And then just any other kind of discrete kind of Tyson-controlled expenses or things you have line of sight to, that you can call out before we overlay the market kind of conditions?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes, sure. So let me give you a couple of things. So, first of all, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that COVID is necessarily the tailwind. Remember I gave you the $330 million, that is a number that is lower than this year, but keep a close eye on COVID because that\u2019s a point-in-time estimate, and I wanted to make sure you\u2019ve got that. But I accept that for the month, that\u2019s a $200 million benefit. I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t give you a number, and I\u2019m not going to give you some specific there, but it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s some pressure on grain. The numbers you were just sort of talking about, that\u2019s probably in the range. That\u2019s going to vary, by the way, based on where the numbers \u2013 where the price goes. The only other one I would say that you don\u2019t have in there, which we did call out during the prepared remarks is what happens with our picture on labor. And I did draw your attention to the fact that there are some locations where we are starting to see some wage pressures. We compete for labor, not just with other meat processors, but with a broad range of companies. And that\u2019s going to take some time to figure that out. Again, the labor market\u2019s seeing a lot of disruption from COVID, and we\u2019ll see how much of that become structural versus temporal.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay, I appreciate that color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead with your question.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey, thanks, good morning, guys.\nDean Banks: Good morning.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to follow-up on Adam\u2019s questions around the guidance, and in particular, just on the revenue guidance that you guys provided for fiscal \u201821, and if you could give us a sense of the variability that\u2019s incorporated from the bottom to the top end of the range, whether it\u2019s variability in volume or price, and what that variability is predicated on, whether it\u2019s related to COVID potential disruptions or lack thereof. And then along the same lines, of the $330 million of COVID costs that you gave, Stewart, I guess, if we see significant closures, absenteeism, if this year looks more like last year, how much better prepared are you guys, it sounds like a lot better prepared to mitigate the costs, recognizing that your top priority is safety? Just help us gauge those if you could?\nStewart Glendinning: Okay. So let me run through the questions in quickly. So first of all, on the top line, the big drivers for the top line and you pulled some of the items, I won\u2019t break them out by percentage, but certainly price is going to be a big \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a big one. That obviously has a fair bit of volatility, especially in our commodity meat businesses Pork and Beef, for sure. That\u2019s going to move around. Keep in mind also that depending on how COVID goes, so will our foodservice volumes and that has an impact on our average pricing. So those are probably the biggest factors that you might be able to make some educated guesses on each of those. In terms of the COVID costs, yes, look, I mean some costs we incurred and they are sort of one-time. We put up all the barriers, we \u2013 initially masks were costing more, it was hard to fund. And so I think you\u2019re going to find some of those costs, either one has to be repeated or maybe aren\u2019t as difficult, but the variability is going to come with what we have to do on labor. We want to look after our employees. This is the number one priority for us. And so we will, first of all, deploy whatever is necessary from a testing or healthcare perspective. We will not give people any incentive to come to work if they are sick. You need to recognize that\u2019s a cost. And then of course, last year, a big chunk of our costs was some of the \"Thank you\" bonuses that we paid to our frontline employees for coming during a very difficult time. And whether or not that has to be repeated will be dependent on the outcome of COVID. So, unfortunately, not an absolutely clear number but that\u2019s because we\u2019re not facing an absolutely clear set of circumstances.\nBen Bienvenu: Understood, understood. Thank you. My second question is related to the Prepared Foods business. And I know there is bifurcated results within this, but the retail is doing quite well. And I\u2019m curious how you guys are thinking about product innovation in the midst of this operating environment. You talked about the SKU rationalization, as well and they may have been across your segments. But, any commentary you could talk about in terms of how you\u2019re building that business for future growth as it relates to the new products and how we should be thinking about the pace of innovation?\nDean Banks: Sure. I\u2019ll comment in a few ways. First off, we spent a good amount of time thinking about the e-commerce channel, which we see growing and how we package our foods to make sure that they\u2019re more accessible, so click and collect, click and deliver, and that\u2019s really paying dividends, as you saw in the results. We do see that even at the extensive COVID state, the consumers are really getting tired of cooking at home and making sure that we have ready-made foods or easy-to-cook or easy-to-prepare foods in our Prepared Foods business. That has also really benefited us through the crisis. Looking forward, we know that there is stickiness in click and collect, click and deliver, and so making sure that our products are even more amenable to that and we\u2019ve looked at everything from preparation to packaging across the entire Prepared Foods franchise to make sure that as we start moving out of the crisis, we\u2019re steady and ready to deliver in that business.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, great, thanks. Congrats on the results and best of luck.\nDean Banks: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Piken: Yes, good morning. My first question was on chicken, there has been a little bit of a reduction in egg sets recently and I guess I\u2019m just sort of wondering in terms of your business, should we be sort of tracking your commodity chicken piece sort of in line with those and how historically higher feed costs have maybe led to a little bit more rational chicken production. Like, how much are you sort of thinking about the volumes for your Chicken business and the potential pros and cons of potentially higher feed costs?\nDean Banks: We\u2019re not going to be able to comment relative to industry. We\u2019ll just talk about ourselves that when we are looking at running our facilities and running them efficiently and effectively, obviously, the way that we place eggs and the way that we deliver those businesses from an operational efficiency perspective, it really depends upon the markets and what\u2019s going on, whether it\u2019s foodservice having some cutbacks or whether it\u2019s retail running away. We are always making adjustments to that and trying to do our best to run our plants full and efficient and effective. So we won\u2019t be able to comment on how that is relative to industry. And related to...\nMichael Piken: Okay. And then...\nDean Banks: Related to costs \u2013 sorry, I\u2019ll finish the second part of your question related to input costs. As you know, some of our product ultimately goes out and prices at commodity spot markets, etcetera. Some of it is contractual where input costs ultimately pass through and some of it are fixed price that\u2019s negotiated over time. So no real comment yet on how that\u2019s playing out relative to what we\u2019re placing and what we are delivering.\nMichael Piken: Great. Yes. And then my follow-up was actually related to kind of the leg quarter market in exports. I guess, specifically, soft pork prices run up quite a bit about a month or two ago, and it seems like the export demand is improving for beef. Like, what is it going to take to churn chicken export market around, add some pause or are you seeing any signs of pick up, and if so, what markets? Thanks.\nDean Banks: Sure. You may have read, we have put a pretty significant amount into an initiative that we are calling One Tyson and complements to international folks that are listening and they\u2019ve done an amazing job at really taking the byproduct of our domestic production and valuing that up in the international markets. And we have just seen tremendous success in that and also working with them to rationalize our export teams to make sure that we\u2019re getting the best deployment efficiency of our products. And then our international markets are also consumers of our own leg quarters. And so we have got a lot of international further-processed capacity that we see, when prices come down, those businesses can deliver better margins. So we are doing everything we can to find full balance and optimization through the One Tyson network.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nDean Banks: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: Could you just elaborate a little bit on ASF? And I know you mentioned some of the volume shifts sort of globally around the world that are being driven by that. But how much is your expected impact more likely that sort of volume reallocation versus a pricing lift? And how do you think about how that impacts what you are thinking on and planning for \u201821?\nDean Banks: I would say ASF is still a really dynamic situation. We have seen it dancing around Germany for some time and it\u2019s shown up in the wild boar population. We are obviously, looking at, as I mentioned, a global shift of production distribution. What we are seeing, obviously, a continued increased demand from China and other export markets that were serviced by Germany. But as you can imagine, the rebalancing component does mitigate some of that and make it so that the German exports end up landing somewhere else, but otherwise were fulfilled by other markets \u2013 were filled by other markets. And so, generally, ASF is not gone, and until there is a vaccine, we don\u2019t expect it to be gone. We know that all countries are bracing and doing a lot to try to mitigate. China is obviously aggressively trying to fill that hole. We have seen a variety of efforts there. And I would say it\u2019s going to continue to impact our business, especially our protein portfolio for some time. Because of the counter balancing effects of each of our proteins, there will be continued demand globally the more and more ASF is impacting the markets. But it\u2019s not going away anytime soon.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the plant-based business is the 10,000 stores around where you had expected to be or has COVID and maybe shelf resets being delayed impacted that where we should expect some upside to that? How does that look maybe going ahead?\nDean Banks: Well, I would say, from a retail perspective, we have seen the uplift in our alternative protein portfolio much like we have in other parts of our business and that\u2019s been encouraging both from a placements perspective and from a velocity perspective. The place where, I think, all new product launches, maybe except for chicken sandwiches, have been impacted is in foodservice. And so we have actually \u2013 obviously, very interested in the foodservice environment for alternative proteins. You have seen the recent announcements again with Jack in the Box, and we are excited about that set of portfolios. But we have not \u2013 we have seen foodservice players revert a little bit back to kind of staple menu items and consolidating menu items through the crisis so they can get people through their drive-thrus and through their take-out more efficiently and effectively.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, couple of questions. One is I am a little surprised how difficult it is to estimate the duration of the backlog of cattle for the Beef segment. Dean, can you tell me, like what are your analysts telling you in terms of like how long that could take? How long do you expect to be having higher weight cattle running through and what makes it challenging to estimate it? And then my last question is, I was reading the Wall Street Journal article that you were in about the COVID response. It says that you had tested half your employees. Is there any reason you didn\u2019t go forward and have tests for all employees at the plants, what\u2019s the pros and cons of that? Thanks.\nDean Banks: Sure, Rob. I will go ahead and take your first question first. So I would say that it\u2019s worth just pointing out that in a volatile uncertain COVID environment, the hesitation you are seeing in our pace and velocity in moving through the cattle backlog is like the \u2013 the analysts are probably likely expressing just as much uncertainty on the ability to produce as really being able to estimate what\u2019s going on in the field. We see adequate cattle supplies for a year-plus out, and we think that\u2019s healthy for our business and we are going to be able to operate and thrive through that. And so probably just seeing hesitance in projecting forward for fear that there could be further shutdowns and that sort of thing and not knowing the precautions that we have taken to ensure we\u2019re going to be able to do what we can to provide adequate production and supply. Related to the COVID response, we have a multi-pronged testing strategy where we are sampling our team members looking for evidence of what\u2019s going on in the community, and we see a community spike, we will obviously look at close contacts and then maybe test an entire plant population. You had asked about the trade-offs of testing. Early in the crisis, we made decisions to aggressively implement plant-wide testing anywhere that we were seeing signal that there could be community infection, and we found a substantial number of asymptomatic positives that were not being identified in the broader community and I would say the media generally was not terribly forgiving of that, and although it was absolutely the right thing to do, both for our team members, for the communities in which we operate, and for our customers to make sure that we can keep our plants running. And so there is balance to that but Tyson has taken aside that aligned with our values, that we are putting team member\u2019s safety absolutely first and we\u2019re testing aggressively anywhere that we see it is needed.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, thank you very much.\nDean Banks: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead with your question.\nKen Zaslow: Hey, good morning everyone.\nDean Banks: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Zaslow: Just \u2013 I get this question a lot from investors. I just kind of would like to see what you could talk about with this. Dean, as you went through your review of the businesses, what do you think the actual cause of the chicken operations issues are like where do you think it stems from and like what happened? Can you give us a thought on how that actually transpired?\nDean Banks: Well, in our business, we have always taken effort to value up a portfolio and build higher margin products in certain given plants and facilities and that decision was made at the expense of operational efficiency whenever protein prices were high. And we could go capture the margin in the marketplace with a correction. And in leg quarters and breast meat and pricing, that makes it hard to run your plants operational efficiently. And we have \u2013 we are now going back to basics and making sure that the plants run lean and effective and efficient. And then if and when pricing ever recovers, we will be able to capture that margin on top of it.\nKen Zaslow: Okay. And then the second question is \u2013 it\u2019s a hard question to ask, I guess is as you were thinking about the year, there was probably a thought that maybe the outlook may not have been as good as it is now. Can you talk about what has changed for the positive? And maybe seeing that, initially, maybe your profitability would not be as strong in 2021, but now it seems like you are a little bit more comfortable with the outlook. Can you talk about how things have progressed and how you\u2019re thinking about the general profitability of 2021?\nDean Banks: Well, this is a little bit of my stepping into the sea, but one thing that I have just been terribly impressed with is the resiliency of our team members and of our business as a whole and our ability to adjust and adapt to really whatever COVID or the markets are throwing at us. And so that then has me confident in 2021 and in the future of Tyson Foods. I think we have assembled a phenomenal set of assets that have \u2013 that worked together to make sure that the business remains resilient to make sure that we keep food on the tables of the global consumer. And then the strategic plan that we put together, when I was in the [indiscernible] that were still standing by today, and our ability to pick up the tempo with that is also really encouraging. The acquisitions that we made internationally turned out to be quite symbiotic and we are finding a lot of efficiencies in the portfolio that we have assembled there. And then the investments we have made in Prepared Foods just continue to surprise in their ability to both gain market share and volume growth. And so, all in there is a lot of reasons to be excited about Tyson Foods today and in the future and the word that I would use is resiliency tied to the core business and got a lot of foresight tied to the strategic plan and how we put it together.\nKen Zaslow: So you are more comfortable that Tyson will actually have a profit growth in 2021, is that a fair assessment?\nDean Banks: No. I am not going to guide on forward-looking profit.\nStewart Glendinning: Maybe just a little bit of perspective from me, Ken. I would go back to the remarks that we made this morning. We said that we expect to see that Chicken and Prepared Foods would improve during the year. You probably can see what is taking place in the cut out for Beef and Pork so that\u2019s fair that you can sort of follow-up for the quarter so far. But I think Beef and Pork will be the variable factor during the year. Right? And that\u2019s the one to watch, I would say, just to figure out how that performs versus our Chicken and Prepared perform. And we are going to know more about that as we go through the year. Of course, the other variable is COVID. And I think as we get into the year through this first quarter, we will have a better perspective.\nKen Zaslow: Okay. And then I am going to sneak in one more. The comment about normalized beef and pork, I don\u2019t know what that means. Because if I go over the last 20 years, I would say normalizes at 2% to 3%, but in reality, for beef, the last four years could be normalized, and that\u2019s a whole different thing. So when you say normalized, do you really mean normalized through the old Tyson or normalized in the new environment where things are \u2013 you have export demand, you have more cattle supply, seems \u2013 the hogs? The word normalized is a very opaque word. I was just curious to make sure that I fully understand what you are trying to get at. And I will leave it there. Thank you very much.\nDean Banks: So I will comment a little bit and then pass it to Stewart. When we say normalized, there is really two components. One is the historical look back on the operating margins of these businesses. But the other component is the effort that we have made to value up variety meats and offal from the portfolio to optimize our cuts and to really run the business more efficiently and even for investments that we have made in tray pack and portioning the proteins and making them more effective and valuable to our consumers and customers. So I would make sure we think through both of those and we think about what new margins ultimately look like. Stewart, do you want to give more color?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. I mean, Ken, I would say, just to the specifics of the margins, when I came into the business, we were talking about normalized as 1% to 3%, but certainly since I have been here, we haven\u2019t seen that. And so we just tossed out the idea that normalized is 1% to 3%. On the other side of things, I think if you look at the quarter, we are turning in almost 12% return on sales for the quarter. And so the question is, can beef and pork continue to operate at those levels? And we think that over time, that will likely move back more to the middle ground, right. And so let me use the sort of more recent trends, I think, as sort of what we\u2019re talking about when we say normalized. There is a lot of global demand for these products. And I think, as an analyst group, you would want to spend some time really understanding whether or not that the ground has shifted in the sense that beef has \u2013 there\u2019s growing demand for beef around the world. And there are not a lot of geographies actually that can produce it. This is one of them.\nKen Zaslow: I agree with you, and I appreciate the answer. Thank you. Have a great day and stay safe.\nDean Banks: Thank you.\nStewart Glendinning: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we are going to end today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Dean for any closing remarks.\nDean Banks: Thanks everyone for your interest in Tyson Foods. I want to give a big thanks to our team members, the communities in which we operate our suppliers, our farmers and all of our investors. From all of us here at Tyson Foods, we wish you a happy holiday season.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stewart Glendinning",
            "content": "Thank you, Dean. As previously mentioned, our business performed well during Q4 and the full fiscal year, especially considering the external challenges facing our company. Now, please keep in mind that Q4 was a 14-week quarter because of the 53-week fiscal year, which is reflected in our GAAP results. The quarterly and annual adjusted results that we refer to throughout have the impact of the additional week removed for comparability purposes. We delivered operating income of $961 million during the quarter, up almost 40% versus Q4 \u201819 and $3.1 billion for the full year, up almost 5% versus last year, leading to a total company return on sales of 7.4%, up about 40 basis points versus last year. This strong performance resulted in a $1.81 of EPS for the quarter, an increase of approximately 50% versus Q4 \u201819 and $5.64 for the full year, up about 3% versus fiscal 2019. This performance was predicated on our flexible crushed protein portfolio that has shown great resiliency during recent periods of disruption to our industry and economy. Our Q4 results include a $75 million positive derivative impact, although on a full year basis, derivative values were relatively flat. We also incurred $200 million of direct COVID-19 costs during Q4 as we continue to prioritize team member health and safety and those costs have not been adjusted out of our results. The reactions from our team members to the investments and initiatives we have implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have been resoundingly positive. Sales and volumes were both lower by about 2% versus Q4 \u201819 driven primarily by the effects of COVID-19, including reduced sales through the foodservice channel. Return on sales for the aggregate business came in at 9% for Q4 and average sales price was down less than 1% versus Q4 \u201819. Jumping into the specific segment results, our Prepared Foods segment delivered strong performance, including operating income of $236 million or 11.2% return on sales. Sales were down 1.8% and volumes were down 5.6% versus the comparable period as a result of retail strength offset by COVID-19 related weakness in foodservice. Operating income improvements were driven by reduced commercial spending, lower commodities and operational improvements, including the benefits of lower write-downs versus last year. The Chicken segment delivered operating income of $91 million, generating a 2.9% return on sales. These results include a $45 million gain from derivative adjustments during the quarter. Sales were down 7.5% and volumes were 5.4% lower versus the comparable period last year, driven in large part by the effects of COVID-19, including lower foodservice volumes. We were impacted by both channel shift as well as operational issues resulting from the pandemic. As Dean outlined in his prepared remarks, we continue to face challenges in our Chicken segment, but remain committed to take the actions necessary to return us to top quartile performance. Beef segment operating income was $483 million during the quarter, generating a return on sales of 12.2%. Sales were up 2.7% and volumes were up 3.8% versus Q4 \u201819 driven principally by the lower comparable figures last year due to lower production capacity as a result of the fire at our Finney County processing facility. We don't anticipate these levels of profitability to persist into the remainder of fiscal 2021, but still expect the Beef business to deliver strong results going forward. Pork operating income was $162 million in the fourth quarter, representing a return on sales of 12.8%. Sales were up 1% and volumes were up almost 7% versus the comparable period last year driven primarily by strong consumption of pork products in both domestic and international markets. Gross margin and volume improvements completely offset higher operating costs to deliver year-over-year adjusted operating income growth of $135 million. Our international business, as Dean mentioned, continues to demonstrate great growth and synergy prospects. This business has now been profitable for the past 2 years, which sets the stage for strong future performance. We will continue to focus on growth opportunities and seek out additional synergy opportunities using our \u201cOne Tyson\u201d framework to increase the value of our international output across the portfolio. Moving on to broader financial performance highlights. Year-to-date operating cash flows were $3.9 billion on a 53-week basis. Our balance sheet and leverage ratios continue to strengthen, driven by gross debt de-leveraging and an increasing liquidity position as a result of strong cash flows. We repaid almost $700 million of bond maturities during the quarter and our ending liquidity, which was higher than we would have originally anticipated, due to strong operating cash flows, was $3.2 billion. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended at 2.3x, which included the negative effects of our direct COVID-19 costs. Net interest expense totaled $123 million during the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter and weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 364 million. Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter came in at $292 million, while depreciation and amortization totaled $316 million. Our crushed protein portfolio strategy provides us with a counter-cyclical effect during periods of weakness in specific protein markets. This differentiated capability allows us to both grow and stabilize the company's aggregate earnings over time, and has contributed to a strong annual operating CAGR over time. Our base protein businesses have continued to generate strong returns and cash flows that will fuel our value-added and international growth into the future. And finally, last week, our Board approved an increase to our annual dividend of $0.10 per share. This increases our annual dividend to $1.78 per share. I'd now like to walk through our financial guidance as we look ahead into the balance of fiscal 2021. About halfway through our first quarter and our businesses are off to a good start. We expect annual revenues of $42 billion to $44 billion. With our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, we expect CapEx spending of between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. The majority of this spending will be toward previously announced capacity additions in our Beef, Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses, as we focus on strategic organic growth plans. We expect to manage liquidity in excess of our historical target of $1 billion, and we will continue to focus on de-leveraging with over $500 million of notes maturing during the fiscal year. Our effective tax rate is expected to approximate 23%. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $440 million. COVID costs are expected to be lower on a run rate basis than the fourth quarter, although, we expect PPE and employee-related payments, amongst other costs, to continue while COVID infections remain active. Although it's still very early and a host of factors could impact the accuracy of our assumptions, including the duration of the pandemic, we're currently anticipating approximately $330 million of COVID costs for the fiscal year. I want to stress that this is a point-in-time estimate, based on what we know currently, and the health and safety of our employees is our top priority. Some of the direct costs we've experienced as a result of COVID-19 have been transient, while others could be structural, specifically regarding team member wages in certain production locations. Because of this, we expect some increased labor costs as we strive to attract and retain talent in the competitive labor markets where we operate. This competition for labor is not only with other meat processes, but with a range of companies hiring similarly skilled people. As 2021 progresses, we will have a better sense of which costs are likely to continue over the longer term. Our new plant in Humboldt will commence operations this year and, as is normal with plant startups, we will incur substantial ramp-up costs. Despite the challenges we've experienced, our countercyclical multi-protein business model across brands, channels, categories and geographies, puts us in a good position as we orient our portfolio toward future growth. As Dean mentioned, we are proud of our team's accomplishments during the fourth quarter and are excited about how our performance sets us up for the balance of fiscal 2021. Our balance sheet liquidity, scale and portfolio of businesses differentiate Tyson from other food companies and position us for long-term growth as we execute against our strategic plan with a constant focus on maximizing long-term shareholder value. I would like to now turn the call back over to Dean to discuss broader fiscal \u201821 business outlook and closing remarks. Dean? Ben, it's Stewart. Just one other thing just to add to that, I mean, look, the good news here is the teams are razor sharp on what needs to be done to move that business to first quartile. One thing just to keep in mind from the modeling and I mentioned in my comments is that Humboldt will come online later this year. That's great. It's going to give us more capacity, but it will come with some increased costs and you could think for modeling purposes, that's going to be a little less than $100 million, probably more weighted to the back half of the year than to the front, but it's a meaningful number. Yes. Alexia, best data I can give you is suggest that you take a look at the 10-K which we filed this morning. If you go back in the segment data there, you will find some breakout, maybe not quite what you are asking for, but it will be \u2013 at least give you a sense of what went through foodservice last year and what's going through there now, about $1 billion lower on a $12 billion. Keep in mind also when you look at that data, that's 53-week data for \u201820 and not 52-week data. Guys, I mean, we've got some detail on our K. I think the best thing to do is just to think broadly about the stats I gave you earlier for the following reason. I think the stats, I gave you sort of $0.10 on corn is $25 million $10 on soybean per ton is $25 million. So look at those. We've got more detail on the K. We ought to think about hedging and sort of ultimately following the basic trend. I mean, it's going to create a lag. So as grain prices go up, our hedging will operate in such a way as to slow that increase in our numbers, but then you'll get the opposite on the other side. So think about the curve, I mean, the curve that is distinctly upward, certainly, in the last month or so. Yes, sure. So let me give you a couple of things. So, first of all, I wouldn't necessarily say that COVID is necessarily the tailwind. Remember I gave you the $330 million, that is a number that is lower than this year, but keep a close eye on COVID because that's a point-in-time estimate, and I wanted to make sure you've got that. But I accept that for the month, that's a $200 million benefit. I'm afraid I didn't give you a number, and I'm not going to give you some specific there, but it's a \u2013 it's some pressure on grain. The numbers you were just sort of talking about, that's probably in the range. That's going to vary, by the way, based on where the numbers \u2013 where the price goes. The only other one I would say that you don't have in there, which we did call out during the prepared remarks is what happens with our picture on labor. And I did draw your attention to the fact that there are some locations where we are starting to see some wage pressures. We compete for labor, not just with other meat processors, but with a broad range of companies. And that's going to take some time to figure that out. Again, the labor market's seeing a lot of disruption from COVID, and we'll see how much of that become structural versus temporal. Okay. So let me run through the questions in quickly. So first of all, on the top line, the big drivers for the top line and you pulled some of the items, I won't break them out by percentage, but certainly price is going to be a big \u2013 it's going to be a big one. That obviously has a fair bit of volatility, especially in our commodity meat businesses Pork and Beef, for sure. That's going to move around. Keep in mind also that depending on how COVID goes, so will our foodservice volumes and that has an impact on our average pricing. So those are probably the biggest factors that you might be able to make some educated guesses on each of those. In terms of the COVID costs, yes, look, I mean some costs we incurred and they are sort of one-time. We put up all the barriers, we \u2013 initially masks were costing more, it was hard to fund. And so I think you're going to find some of those costs, either one has to be repeated or maybe aren't as difficult, but the variability is going to come with what we have to do on labor. We want to look after our employees. This is the number one priority for us. And so we will, first of all, deploy whatever is necessary from a testing or healthcare perspective. We will not give people any incentive to come to work if they are sick. You need to recognize that's a cost. And then of course, last year, a big chunk of our costs was some of the \"Thank you\" bonuses that we paid to our frontline employees for coming during a very difficult time. And whether or not that has to be repeated will be dependent on the outcome of COVID. So, unfortunately, not an absolutely clear number but that's because we're not facing an absolutely clear set of circumstances. Maybe just a little bit of perspective from me, Ken. I would go back to the remarks that we made this morning. We said that we expect to see that Chicken and Prepared Foods would improve during the year. You probably can see what is taking place in the cut out for Beef and Pork so that's fair that you can sort of follow-up for the quarter so far. But I think Beef and Pork will be the variable factor during the year. Right? And that's the one to watch, I would say, just to figure out how that performs versus our Chicken and Prepared perform. And we are going to know more about that as we go through the year. Of course, the other variable is COVID. And I think as we get into the year through this first quarter, we will have a better perspective. Yes. I mean, Ken, I would say, just to the specifics of the margins, when I came into the business, we were talking about normalized as 1% to 3%, but certainly since I have been here, we haven't seen that. And so we just tossed out the idea that normalized is 1% to 3%. On the other side of things, I think if you look at the quarter, we are turning in almost 12% return on sales for the quarter. And so the question is, can beef and pork continue to operate at those levels? And we think that over time, that will likely move back more to the middle ground, right. And so let me use the sort of more recent trends, I think, as sort of what we're talking about when we say normalized. There is a lot of global demand for these products. And I think, as an analyst group, you would want to spend some time really understanding whether or not that the ground has shifted in the sense that beef has \u2013 there's growing demand for beef around the world. And there are not a lot of geographies actually that can produce it. This is one of them. Thanks, Ken."

            "name": "Dean Banks",
            "content": "Thank you, Jon and many thanks to everyone listening for their interest in Tyson Foods. We hope you are all safe and healthy as we continue to navigate the pandemic. I am thankful for the efforts of everyone, of Tyson's nearly 140,000 team members and wants you to know their health and safety remain our top priority. The dedication of our team members and the future of our business have me excited to be in my first earnings call as CEO. We have an exceptional leadership team with tremendous experience across protein production, consumer insights, innovation, technology and more and I am truly excited about the growth and success we will drive as a team. We have recently faced unprecedented and unfamiliar times, but our business is settling down and we are uniquely positioned to fulfill our long-term strategy. Our business performed well and delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results. Our team members, agricultural partners and customers have shown resilience. This has enabled us to maintain and accelerate our efforts to provide global consumers with a safe and accessible food supply. Before we talk about fourth quarter results, I would like to cover our team's accomplishments over the last 12 months. At the onset of the pandemic, we launched an internal task force to address the virus. We made substantial investments in our personal protective equipment, social distancing safeguards and other increased health and safety measures across our business. We have seen a dramatic reduction in active cases involving our team members since last spring. In an effort to stay ahead of the virus, we have launched a new industry leading monitoring strategy that involves weekly testing of a sample of team members, which has so far proven to be invaluable. We had $540 million in direct incremental COVID-19 costs for the full year, including about $300 million of Thank you bonuses and other benefits paid directly to our team members for their efforts. We managed core expenses aggressively in an effort to partially offset the increased costs related to COVID-19. Our Beef and Pork segments both delivered a strong performance on the year while Prepared Foods showed positive momentum, including a continuation of share gains across many retail categories. Our core retail lines grew volume in every quarter of the fiscal year, up over 17% during the latest 52 weeks. Our chicken business is still performing below our long-term earnings expectations. While our Tyson frozen value-added and premium air-chilled products have performed strongly, other businesses have not. The biggest drivers of our underperformance are not having full staffing levels, a portion of which can be attributed to the ongoing effects of the coronavirus, operational execution and pricing. The majority of our improvement opportunity lies in reducing the mix and yield impacts of the three drivers I just mentioned and most of this is centered in a handful of our plants. The inefficiencies driven by reduced staffing levels and poor execution has translated to higher cost per pound. We expect progress toward these issues to face headwinds from absenteeism and other COVID-19 related complexities during the first half of the year. I remain hopeful that a vaccine and a gradual return to normalcy in the second half will result in a net improvement for the year. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to sustainable business practices and corporate social responsibility. Our efforts included the following: enhancing our framework to promote equity, inclusion and diversity in the workplace, including $5 million in committed donations to organizations that are advancing the cause of lasting change; our work to verify sustainable cattle production practices on more than 5 million acres of grazing land in the largest beef transparency program in the U.S.; record protein donations across the country; and the development in recently announced Forest Protection Standard to reassert that we have virtually no deforestation risk across our global supply chain. In the alternative protein space, we bolstered the company's offerings under the Raised & Rooted brand, while extending our retail presence to 10,000 stores in less than a year, entering the quick-service restaurant channel and launching products in Europe. Over the past year, we have seen our plant-based offerings' retail sales increase over 250% and we are excited to build on this momentum alongside our customers as we meet evolving consumer demand for years to come. Now, let's discuss some high level takeaways from our fourth quarter. In the U.S., the pandemic continue to drive higher levels of retail demand and overall lower levels of foodservice volume. While quick-service restaurants are close to or better than pre-COVID levels, full service restaurants continue to operate at about 80% of normal with wide variations by geography, while schools and cafeterias are operating at levels significantly below normal. These channel impacts, as well as higher levels of absenteeism, increased the cost and complexity of our operations. Europe has a similar operating environment as the U.S., while our Asian businesses are almost back to normal. The continued strength of at-home consumption is driving historically high retail and e-commerce sales and Tyson is winning. Our retail core business lines experienced their ninth straight quarter of share growth and continue to outperform the top 10 food manufacturers. Volumes in these lines were up nearly 15% during the latest 13 weeks, leading to nearly 2 percentage points in volume share growth during that period. As consumers increasingly shifted towards little or no contact buying methods during the pandemic, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 99% on a full year basis and 126% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. With this growth, Tyson's online sales penetration through its e-commerce channel partners is now estimated at over $1 billion and we expect continued relevance of this channel moving forward. The company experienced solid results during the fourth quarter driven by strong operating income performances in our Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods businesses. The performance of these segments offset lower results in our chicken business. In total, we delivered almost $1 billion of operating income for the fourth quarter in spite of the negative impacts of $200 million associated with COVID-19. This represents an operating income improvement of $275 million versus Q4 of 2019, an increase of almost 40%. Our Prepared Foods business delivered strong Q4 results. Our brands and products continue to resonate with consumers as demonstrated by our track record of share growth, nine quarters in a row. We have a balanced mix of distribution channels, giving us a resilient business model that's able to effectively react to external factors, including obstacles caused by COVID-19. Improved operational execution as well as lower commercial spend, also helped to drive strong Q4 results. We are also pursuing SKU rationalization and optimization opportunities across our production network. Our beef and pork businesses continue to be an important part of our company's portfolio strategy. They generated very strong returns during the quarter, enabling investments in key value-added and international growth initiatives across our business. The Beef segment delivered solid earnings as the cut-out margin remained strong, while live cattle prices driven by plentiful supplies remained relatively low. This was set against the backdrop of continued strong consumer demand. Our operational performance recovered substantially from the early COVID-19 impacts and volumes were up 31% versus the third quarter. Exports have also been strong for our Beef segment, which serve as a way for us to optimize all parts of the animal, including products that aren't traditionally consumed within the American diet. We expect to see continued adequate cattle supplies during fiscal 2021. The Pork segment also delivered very strong earnings during the quarter, despite a narrowing of the spread as hog costs increased and the cut-out came down. The hog supply remained strong, while our plants faced less disruption and produced significantly improved volumes versus Q3. The plentiful conditions we have seen in the hog supply are beginning to moderate as a result of the industry's ongoing recovery, but we expect adequate supplies in the near-term. In an effort to support the independent hog farmers who rely on us for consistent and reliable outlet for their livestock, we have worked hard to safely maximize our processing capacity. African swine fever has persisted overseas moving into Germany's wild boar population. This infection quickly led to certain nations banning German pork exports, which we expect to create incremental global demand for U.S. pork. We are beginning to see some level of herd rebuilding in China, but we agree with industry analysts that a complete recovery may depend on eradication of ASF and/or the success of a commercial grade vaccine. Our view is that full recovery could still be a multi-year event. Until this occurs, we expect to see a continued redistribution of global pork supplies. Within the U.S., export demand has increased at a pace that has helped to offset increased pork supplies domestically. This demand has been supportive of hog prices, which is critical for U.S. independent hog farmers. Our Q4 chicken results improved sequentially compared to the third quarter as we saw some recovery in our operations and experienced lower COVID-19 costs. However, the results were not better than our prior year as a number of the challenges which I outlined earlier are still with us. Having said that, we have seen tremendous performance within our branded retail value-added poultry lines, including more than 24% volume growth during the quarter with simultaneous volume and dollar share gains. The impacts of COVID-19 on channel volumes and operating efficiency resulted in net negative volumes for the quarter and higher operating costs. We also saw a dramatic softening of the late quarter market during the quarter, which has since leveled out. As I mentioned, we are aggressively executing a variety of operational and supply chain efficiency programs to better position us for long-term competitiveness. Additionally, we are continually identifying ways to drive costs out of our structure, while remaining keenly focused on operational improvements and customer service. As COVID-19 related absenteeism rates have improved, although not yet back to historical levels, we are focused on the operational improvement programs mentioned in fiscal 2020. We still believe the original target of $200 million in cost savings as a result of these improvement initiatives is attainable. Our international portfolio continues to give us great opportunities for growth and synergy. Our view remains that the vast majority of global protein consumption growth will happen outside of the U.S. So we are positioning our company to meet that need. During the last quarter, we found new, profitable international outlets for U.S. based byproducts that would otherwise realize relatively low values domestically. By leveraging our U.S. based scale with our newly acquired and legacy international businesses, we have identified repeatable opportunities to margin up bulk export products into a convenient value-added and retail-ready format for international markets. The benefit of these value-added sales, which originate in our domestic business and are sold throughout our international network, is an example of how our One Tyson approach helps us meet global demand while enhancing the company's margin structure. We will continue to seek out and leverage these and other synergistic opportunities across our global network as we expand abroad and continue to learn from consumers in these growing markets. We also recently announced our plans to build new production capacity in China and Thailand as well as expansion of our facility in the Netherlands. These initiatives will add substantial fully-cooked poultry capacity to our network, which will help us serve emerging markets and strategic customers. And last, we plan to accelerate our focus on initiatives to ensure a competitive cost structure moving forward, which includes optimizing organizational structures and other cost reduction activities. In summary, I am pleased by our fourth quarter performance and I am excited about our future. I would now like to turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our Q4 financial performance and fiscal 2021 financial outlook. Thank you, Stewart. We have a bright future ahead and we remain committed to navigate the risks and market based factors that we may face, especially in the current environment. We will prepare for, and respond to those risks to the best of our ability just as we have always done. With respect to our view on the business and operating environment, as we look ahead into the balance of fiscal 2021, we expect consumption behavior will continue to orient towards meals at home. Unless the current wave causes widespread shutdowns, we would expect to see a continuing gradual recovery in foodservice volume throughout the year. This is, of course, dependent on the extent of the pandemic spread within our communities, the broad availability of a vaccine and any local or federal regulatory restrictions. As we look across our businesses, we are evaluating where we can utilize automation and technology in our work that will enable more efficient and effective collaboration and operations. Grain futures for 2021, has strengthened recently due to diminishing U.S. production prospects from earlier in the season and record high demand in China. Prices have been further supported by unfavorable weather and competing crop producing countries and could result in overall grain costs being higher for 2021. Remember, our previous guidance that a $0.10 per bushel move in corn or a $10 per ton move in soybean meal translates to an approximately $25 million change to cost of goods sold. The trade environment continues to present uncertainty, especially considering this year's elections and the potential implications that may have on trade policy. We recently observed higher freight costs due to limited driver availability and mix-related load and efficiencies that are exploring opportunities to mitigate and offset this trend. This is in addition to the challenges we mentioned earlier around ensuring full staffing in our plants. Beef and Pork segment margins are expected to moderate toward more historical levels as industry capacity, live animal supplies and finished goods inventories equilibrate, although we still expect these businesses to generate healthy returns. At the same time, we expect stronger performances from our Prepared Foods and Chicken businesses as we sharpen our focus on cost reduction and operational improvement. We also expect that when the virus recedes, our ability to drive business improvements will accelerate. In closing, our business performed well during an unprecedented time. Our team displayed resilience when consumers, more than ever, needed access to a stable and accessible food supply. While we will continue to face pandemic-related challenges in fiscal 2021, we are settling the business down to be focused on executing our long term strategy of generating strong returns for shareholders. I am excited for the opportunities ahead for this great company, and I am certain, we have the people, products and strategies in place to drive future growth. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready for Q&A. Good morning, Ken. Sure, Ken. First and foremost, our team member safety has been our top priority and we have taken a tremendous amount of forward-looking action to make sure that we are prepared so that when they come into work everyday, they not only feel safe but they look around and see variety of precautions that we have taken to protect them. So, you have seen some announcements that we have made around hiring of nurses in our facilities. That was in anticipation of what we are seeing today and for fear that, that actually could manifest itself. We have posted a position for Chief Medical Officer, which we are close on. And I would say that the most important aspect of our preventative measures was this has been, how we have acted upon the availability of testing with what we are calling our always-on testing strategy where we are sampling team members as they come in and making sure that we can identify what's going on both in the public numbers and the community, but also what we are seeing from our team members coming into the plants and that's just been tremendously invaluable and getting them comfort that they are not at risk of catching anything. And then I would say that it's also been invaluable to the communities in which we operate. You might have seen an article that came out a few weeks ago in Storm Lake, where a former state health official cited that the county in which we operate actually had lower COVID numbers and she attributed that to how we are acting with our monitoring and testing strategy, much like we anticipated the need for masks early in the first wave of the crisis and chartered a plane to take proactive aggressive action to get precaution for our team members \u2013 precautionary protections for our team members. I'd say, in this crisis, we have been \u2013 in the second wave, we have been preparing all along and you can see that in our expenses. From a demand perspective \u2013 from a demand labor perspective, from a labor perspective, I would say that we, as Stewart mentioned in his comments, we have been bonusing our team members and just saying thank you. We know that they have options for where they go and we want Tyson Foods to be a place where they can come to work and thrive everyday. Yes, we are not going to be able to preannounce or anything like that. But what I would say is that we are expecting beef and pork to ultimately, through 2021, normalize. I would say, when you are thinking about those two businesses, specifically, from a pork perspective, hogs are coming in at weight now, so we think we have worked through some portion of the backlog, while there may still be some out there. We do expect adequate supplies through the year. In beef, cattle are still coming in quite a bit overweight and so we are seeing that there is quite a bit of backlog and ample supply certainly for the year to come. Chicken, as you have seen through the reports, we are aggressively pursuing operational improvements and you have seen the leadership change we have made there, about complementing Chad Martin and his exceptional leadership with Donnie King, who is an industry veteran leading the business. That's going to take some time. Recovering chicken is going to be a long effort. We have got a handful of plants that are just not operating operational efficiently. And then the variability related to the crisis and what's happening in foodservice in some of those plants is just continuing to make that challenging, but we are working hard to make the operational improvements we need. And Prepared Foods has been performing strong. We are very proud of the work that they are doing there. And much like the other parts of the business, we really need foodservice to come back online for that business to be everything that we know it can, but the ability of the team to flex between retail and foodservice has been phenomenal. No problem. Thanks, Ben. Yes. Ben, I would love to be able to give you some guidance, but as you have seen, if we have started giving any direction a month and a half ago, they have been wrong. The COVID impacts and increases are continuing with shutdowns both in our domestic and in some international markets. And we are just not able to \u2013 we are not able to guide at this point. I won't be able to give a ton of specifics, but as you know, we have put out guidance before that we were going after about $200 million in operational improvements in the chicken business before the crisis. And as we reported, we were making good progress on that. And then as you rightly point out, COVID really affected quite a bit of that. We are still making improvements everyday. Our leaders are in our plants looking for inefficiencies and looking for the ways that we can get those plants running full again and back on track. But as far as recovering that full $200 million, there will be some value in the recovery from COVID in foodservice and getting our plants back up to full operational capacity. But we are not waiting on that much like you have seen in the past, the shift from foodservice to retail. We have done that where we can. We have also maintained flexibility to support our fast growing QSR partners who are even surpassing their original sales with their progress in drive-thru and take-out. And so it is going to take some resolution in COVID for us to really make the growth and expansion there we want, but we are not waiting for that. We are taking aggressive steps as we speak. Thanks, Ben. We can, Alexia. Go ahead. Thank you. No, we are not going to be able to break those down anymore specifically. I would even cite just so you read of the situation that some of our QSR partners are actually surpassing previous volumes, which is really exciting to see for them and that's changing quite dynamically. So, we won't be able to give any additional direction related to how that breaks down. Yes, I'll comment on the word momentum. It's got quite a bit of momentum. We have \u2013 some of the SKUs are really surpassing expectations related to velocity. And as you saw, we've expanded to a significant number of retail stores. You may have also seen the announcement just recently that we are kicking off a pilot with Jack in the Box. We're thrilled about that and our progress there in a variety of prospects with the business. We'll not give any specifics on the size, but we're thrilled with the investment and the momentum that we've had. Thank you. Good morning, Peter. So I'll stress one thing that we've really put team member safety first and as you saw through the previous waves, we have taken no hesitation to idle plants, whenever we think it's the right thing to do to either do deep cleaning or mass testing or whatever was required. And so in this crisis, we are taking as many precautions as possible to make sure we're keeping our team members safe and that results in them feeling safe coming to work and that results in us being able to keep our plants up and running and feeding the world. Related to vaccine availability, look, it's too early to push forward and what that could ultimately look like. You have to consider distribution, obviously, side effect profile and a million other things when thinking about how that's going to ultimately impact your business. And from a broader perspective, our business is operating through this climate very well. What I would say is that, whether it's our balanced portfolio, whether it's the protections that we've taken, the business has proven extraordinarily resilient, and we've heard from really every administration that they consider companies like Tyson and industries, specifically around food, to be mission-critical for the country. And I'm sure that if the vaccine is proving to be effective and safe and our team members decide that they want it for their own protections, then it will be made available. Good morning, Adam. Yes, it's certainly a good question, Adam. I'd say our businesses, specifically in Chicken, as you pointed out, it's very mixed. So our retail value-added portfolio has performed just phenomenally through the crisis, up north of 24%. We've been thrilled with the market share gains there. And the other aspects of our business, whether it's tray pack or fresh or small bird, they're all competing and all being impacted in very different ways. Specifically, some of our business has been very strongly hit by daily sales being down through the crisis. And so we watch performance really on a business unit by business unit basis and some of the businesses that have been impacted, specifically the plants, due to mix and operational efficiency, that's what we're talking about in getting back up to top quartile performance on those that are underperforming in each of their given segments. I don't think I'll be able to give any more specific guidance than that. Good morning. Sure. I'll comment in a few ways. First off, we spent a good amount of time thinking about the e-commerce channel, which we see growing and how we package our foods to make sure that they're more accessible, so click and collect, click and deliver, and that's really paying dividends, as you saw in the results. We do see that even at the extensive COVID state, the consumers are really getting tired of cooking at home and making sure that we have ready-made foods or easy-to-cook or easy-to-prepare foods in our Prepared Foods business. That has also really benefited us through the crisis. Looking forward, we know that there is stickiness in click and collect, click and deliver, and so making sure that our products are even more amenable to that and we've looked at everything from preparation to packaging across the entire Prepared Foods franchise to make sure that as we start moving out of the crisis, we're steady and ready to deliver in that business. Thank you. We're not going to be able to comment relative to industry. We'll just talk about ourselves that when we are looking at running our facilities and running them efficiently and effectively, obviously, the way that we place eggs and the way that we deliver those businesses from an operational efficiency perspective, it really depends upon the markets and what's going on, whether it's foodservice having some cutbacks or whether it's retail running away. We are always making adjustments to that and trying to do our best to run our plants full and efficient and effective. So we won't be able to comment on how that is relative to industry. And related to... Related to costs \u2013 sorry, I'll finish the second part of your question related to input costs. As you know, some of our product ultimately goes out and prices at commodity spot markets, etcetera. Some of it is contractual where input costs ultimately pass through and some of it are fixed price that's negotiated over time. So no real comment yet on how that's playing out relative to what we're placing and what we are delivering. Sure. You may have read, we have put a pretty significant amount into an initiative that we are calling One Tyson and complements to international folks that are listening and they've done an amazing job at really taking the byproduct of our domestic production and valuing that up in the international markets. And we have just seen tremendous success in that and also working with them to rationalize our export teams to make sure that we're getting the best deployment efficiency of our products. And then our international markets are also consumers of our own leg quarters. And so we have got a lot of international further-processed capacity that we see, when prices come down, those businesses can deliver better margins. So we are doing everything we can to find full balance and optimization through the One Tyson network. Good morning. I would say ASF is still a really dynamic situation. We have seen it dancing around Germany for some time and it's shown up in the wild boar population. We are obviously, looking at, as I mentioned, a global shift of production distribution. What we are seeing, obviously, a continued increased demand from China and other export markets that were serviced by Germany. But as you can imagine, the rebalancing component does mitigate some of that and make it so that the German exports end up landing somewhere else, but otherwise were fulfilled by other markets \u2013 were filled by other markets. And so, generally, ASF is not gone, and until there is a vaccine, we don't expect it to be gone. We know that all countries are bracing and doing a lot to try to mitigate. China is obviously aggressively trying to fill that hole. We have seen a variety of efforts there. And I would say it's going to continue to impact our business, especially our protein portfolio for some time. Because of the counter balancing effects of each of our proteins, there will be continued demand globally the more and more ASF is impacting the markets. But it's not going away anytime soon. Well, I would say, from a retail perspective, we have seen the uplift in our alternative protein portfolio much like we have in other parts of our business and that's been encouraging both from a placements perspective and from a velocity perspective. The place where, I think, all new product launches, maybe except for chicken sandwiches, have been impacted is in foodservice. And so we have actually \u2013 obviously, very interested in the foodservice environment for alternative proteins. You have seen the recent announcements again with Jack in the Box, and we are excited about that set of portfolios. But we have not \u2013 we have seen foodservice players revert a little bit back to kind of staple menu items and consolidating menu items through the crisis so they can get people through their drive-thrus and through their take-out more efficiently and effectively. Sure, Rob. I will go ahead and take your first question first. So I would say that it's worth just pointing out that in a volatile uncertain COVID environment, the hesitation you are seeing in our pace and velocity in moving through the cattle backlog is like the \u2013 the analysts are probably likely expressing just as much uncertainty on the ability to produce as really being able to estimate what's going on in the field. We see adequate cattle supplies for a year-plus out, and we think that's healthy for our business and we are going to be able to operate and thrive through that. And so probably just seeing hesitance in projecting forward for fear that there could be further shutdowns and that sort of thing and not knowing the precautions that we have taken to ensure we're going to be able to do what we can to provide adequate production and supply. Related to the COVID response, we have a multi-pronged testing strategy where we are sampling our team members looking for evidence of what's going on in the community, and we see a community spike, we will obviously look at close contacts and then maybe test an entire plant population. You had asked about the trade-offs of testing. Early in the crisis, we made decisions to aggressively implement plant-wide testing anywhere that we were seeing signal that there could be community infection, and we found a substantial number of asymptomatic positives that were not being identified in the broader community and I would say the media generally was not terribly forgiving of that, and although it was absolutely the right thing to do, both for our team members, for the communities in which we operate, and for our customers to make sure that we can keep our plants running. And so there is balance to that but Tyson has taken aside that aligned with our values, that we are putting team member's safety absolutely first and we're testing aggressively anywhere that we see it is needed. Thanks, Rob. Good morning, Ken. Well, in our business, we have always taken effort to value up a portfolio and build higher margin products in certain given plants and facilities and that decision was made at the expense of operational efficiency whenever protein prices were high. And we could go capture the margin in the marketplace with a correction. And in leg quarters and breast meat and pricing, that makes it hard to run your plants operational efficiently. And we have \u2013 we are now going back to basics and making sure that the plants run lean and effective and efficient. And then if and when pricing ever recovers, we will be able to capture that margin on top of it. Well, this is a little bit of my stepping into the sea, but one thing that I have just been terribly impressed with is the resiliency of our team members and of our business as a whole and our ability to adjust and adapt to really whatever COVID or the markets are throwing at us. And so that then has me confident in 2021 and in the future of Tyson Foods. I think we have assembled a phenomenal set of assets that have \u2013 that worked together to make sure that the business remains resilient to make sure that we keep food on the tables of the global consumer. And then the strategic plan that we put together, when I was in the [indiscernible] that were still standing by today, and our ability to pick up the tempo with that is also really encouraging. The acquisitions that we made internationally turned out to be quite symbiotic and we are finding a lot of efficiencies in the portfolio that we have assembled there. And then the investments we have made in Prepared Foods just continue to surprise in their ability to both gain market share and volume growth. And so, all in there is a lot of reasons to be excited about Tyson Foods today and in the future and the word that I would use is resiliency tied to the core business and got a lot of foresight tied to the strategic plan and how we put it together. No. I am not going to guide on forward-looking profit. So I will comment a little bit and then pass it to Stewart. When we say normalized, there is really two components. One is the historical look back on the operating margins of these businesses. But the other component is the effort that we have made to value up variety meats and offal from the portfolio to optimize our cuts and to really run the business more efficiently and even for investments that we have made in tray pack and portioning the proteins and making them more effective and valuable to our consumers and customers. So I would make sure we think through both of those and we think about what new margins ultimately look like. Stewart, do you want to give more color? Thank you. Thanks everyone for your interest in Tyson Foods. I want to give a big thanks to our team members, the communities in which we operate our suppliers, our farmers and all of our investors. From all of us here at Tyson Foods, we wish you a happy holiday season."

Before we get to the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the announcement we made earlier this morning. Later this year, Dean Banks will take over President and Chief Executive Officer of Tyson Foods, effective October 3. I am excited to continue at Tyson in the new role as Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. Tyson's future is bright with Dean at the helm. As our Chairman said in the press release this morning, Dean and the entire executive leadership team have a strong breadth and depth of capabilities and they bring energy and vision to Tyson Foods. Dean has an impressive background in entrepreneurship, technology and the healthcare industry, which makes him ideally suited to lead Tyson in our efforts to integrate advanced technologies into our operations and further our focus on team member health and safety. Dean is the right person to lead our company in the next stage of growth. Dean, would you like to say a few words?\nDean Banks: Thank you, Noel, for those kind words and for your 37 years of service and many contributions to Tyson. I also want to offer my sincere thanks to the more than 140,000 team members who have given me a warm welcome over the past three years. I've had the opportunity to get to know many of you and your integrity, passion and commitment to feeding the world is a critical part of why I am here. I am honored to lead Tyson Foods as its next CEO and look forward to working with our company's leadership and executing our strategy to capitalize on opportunities for innovation across the protein spectrum. Building upon the strong foundation established by Noel, I will continue to serve our customers, team members, stakeholders and shareholders to drive our strategic initiatives and build our business in current and new categories and geographies. And finally, thank you to the Board of Directors for entrusting me to lead Tyson into our next phase. Noel?\nNoel White: Thank you, Dean. Now we'll discuss the third quarter. I want to start by thanking our team members for their dedication and diligence as we continue to navigate the pandemic. This quarter has been full of challenges in the ever-changing environment. However, I am pleased with how we've adapted and adjusted to the circumstances and continue to operate our facilities without layoffs. While we've worked hard to avoid the supply chain disruptions experienced by our livestock suppliers and customers, our top priority has appropriately remained the health and safety of our team members. We've made substantial investments in COVID-19-related safety measures for our team. Earlier this year, we transformed our facilities with a host of safeguards that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance. We purchased 150 walk-through temperature scanners to check workers when they arrive. We supplied face masks, have installed workstation dividers and have more than 500 social distance monitors in our facilities. About 40,000 of our team members or a third of our U.S. workforce has been tested for the virus. Currently less than 1% of Tyson Foods' U.S. workforce of over 120,000 team members has active COVID-19. Tyson Foods has partnered with outside medical experts and public health officials to understand and prevent the spread of the virus and to share what we've learned. We have partnered with Matrix Medical to set up on-site medical clinics at some of our locations. We also supplied more than 300,000 cloth masks to our team members across the country to share with their families, friends, and loved ones. And last week, we announced the launch of a new strategic COVID-19 monitoring program and the expansion of our occupational health staff, including a new Chief Medical Officer position. The new data-driven program was designed with the help of outside medical experts and involves weekly testing of a sampling of team members to monitor for the presence of the virus. It also includes testing of workers who have symptoms as well as those who have come into close contact with others who have the virus. Protecting our team members is essential to the long-term growth and will remain our top priority. Now I'll turn to the third quarter results, which reflect the value of our comprehensive portfolio and operational agility. Dean will take us through the segment results and Stewart will provide detail on the third quarter results. Without a doubt, our third quarter was one of the most volatile and uncertain periods I've seen during my 40-year career in the industry. However, our commitment to team member health and safety and investments in operations and portfolio strategy effectively positioned us to weather unprecedented marketplace volatility while supporting our farmers, ranchers and producers while working to meet our customer needs. Our scale across proteins, products and brands helps to insulate us during the economic cycles, even historically volatile ones enables us to more readily adjust consumer demands across brands and channels. While COVID-19 has had impacts on our business, I am pleased to say that our company has performed well. Our third quarter sales were just over $10 billion, which is about 8% lower than the same quarter last year, driven by 10.6% lower volumes offset by 2.6% higher price. Our adjusted earnings of $1.40 per share were driven by strong performance in our Beef and Pork segments. While Chicken results were weak early in the quarter driven by significant declines in foodservice and deli demand that affected both volume and mix, we experienced a volume rebound later in the third quarter as states began to reopen, and this has carried over into the fourth quarter. Again, the overall strength of our business, despite challenges earlier in the quarter speaks to the value of our portfolio-based strategy. In Q3, we experienced substantial demand for our core retail and branded products, and we work diligently to get as much product to our customers as possible. This demand shift resulted in core retail line volume growth of more than 26% compared to Q3 last year and share gains in those categories. Meanwhile, we absorbed major declines in foodservice, which resulted in a net reduction to overall volumes during the quarter. The retail channel continued to show strong levels of demand in both volume and dollars, and I was pleased to see another quarter of share growth across our core business lines, this makes eight quarters in a row. Another area where we benefit is the strength of our brand, the breadth of our reach and the ability to produce locally in our international markets and responding to the global demand growth and fluctuations. In the third quarter, exports to many parts of the world performed well, including to Japan and Mexico. In-country performance in China remains strong and the impact of COVID-19 within the other countries where we operate has been less than expected. Reduced hog supplies caused by African swine fever continue to present opportunities to fulfill international demand from U.S. exports and in-country production. It's important to note that a large portion of Tyson's export sales are associated with products that don't traditionally fit within the American consumer's diet. This means export markets help serve as a way for us to optimize utilization of livestock. This contributes to the profitability of the livestock farmer who depended on forest supply. In the third quarter, we took a number of actions to support our supply chain. We unilaterally instituted increase in payments for the prices we paid for our cattle ranchers, provided weight discount relief for hog and cattle producers, and capped prices on certain cuts of beef to our customers. Supporting our partners and customers is essential to our business. Now let's talk about the current operating environment. We have enhanced operations to ensure agility, continue to implement automation to improve safety and efficiencies for our team members and deployed technology to meet consumer demand. Because of these investments, we were positioned to weather the impacts of COVID-19 on our channel mix, as we've experienced increased retail and reduced foodservice demand. From a supply chain perspective, our facilities quickly adapt and were possible to new product mixes to take advantage of changing customer needs and market dynamics due to COVID-19. We operate more than 140 food production facilities in the United States. And although some continue to operate at a decrease production levels, the scope of our operations continue to provide us with the flexibility, agility and redundancy needed to support our customers and help keep refrigerators and shelves stocked. This is a clear benefit to our company scale and how we continue our crucial mission of feeding families during this unprecedented global crisis. Despite our strong performance during the third quarter, COVID-19 created significant direct incremental cost for our business totaling approximately $340 million. This does not include the indirect impacts we've experienced such as lower volumes or operational inefficiencies as a result of absenteeism and lower capacity. Our direct incremental costs were primarily associated with ensuring the health, safety, and recognition or our team members, which include enhanced team member safety precautions in our facilities, communication and education within communities, team member bonuses, enhanced benefits and other COVID-19 protection measures. Due to the nature of these direct incremental expenses, our segments were primarily impacted based on the relative number of team members and the degree of production disruptions they have experienced. We know that some of these expenses will continue, likely at a lower run rate, and we know that we will need to prepare to adjust our operation as the virus persist. Even after accounting produced COVID-19-related costs during the quarter, our business continues to show strength and resilience. While COVID-19 has been disruptive, we have a strong long-term outlook for Tyson Foods. Global population income growth will continue to drive an increased need for protein. That's why we expanded the international footprint we've established is so important to our future growth. Our assets, capabilities and products in China, Asia-Pacific and Europe give us the ability to meet that growing demand. Our lessons from Asia's COVID-19 experience also help shorten the learning curve for us domestically. Furthermore, the virus has accelerated consumer demand for food through alternative channels, such as e-commerce. We believe e-commerce demand in grocery and foodservice will remain elevated and we intend to capitalize on the shift. We also continue to invest aggressively in our brands and in automation and technology, as we seek to create new and more effective ways of doing business. In the technology area alone, we've initiated hundreds of projects over the last three years, many of which are both enterprise and scale and focused on automation and advanced analytics. Automation will help drive efficiencies and protect team members in our facilities. We expect these initiatives to generate strong returns as we move into the future. Of course, there is undoubtedly more work ahead of us, we remain focused on continued execution of operational improvements to drive a more efficient agile organization, which in turn enables us to remain nimble and unlock opportunities to grow the business. As we look beyond this year, we are prepared to navigate prolonged pandemic-related uncertainty. We are investing in operational flexibility to ensure that we can continue to meet customer demand while living in a potentially long-term COVID-19 environment. We recognized that our level of future growth is dependent on away-from-home eating occasions, which will be impacted by communities opening up and potentially reclosing. We will thus remain nimble and remain ready to adjust our facilities as demand picks up or shifts. We are managing our business well and our balance sheet and liquidity position continue to show strength as a result of strong cash flow generation. We believe higher levels of liquidity are prudent until we have more visibility in recovery and realization of a new dynamic environment. We can't say how long the impacts of COVID-19 will last, but we've demonstrated the ability to operate while facing the current challenges. Our business is flexible and ready to take advantage of channel and business shifts. We will continue to adapt our business to address market challenges. I believe shareholders will benefit from our strengths, which include our portfolio, distribution channels, dedicated workforce and scale. Now I'd like Dean to give us a recap of our business segments.\nDean Banks: Thank you, Noel. I want to start by echoing Noel's sentiment as it relates to the resilience that our team members have shown in light of COVID-19. I am humbled by the response during this difficult time and it's been both remarkable and extraordinary. I will focus my remarks today on our third quarter results and then provide additional color on each of our segments. Under the circumstances, our performance has been good. Despite challenges and with team members\u2019 safety is our top priority, we did everything possible to maintain operations in order to keep customers shelves and refrigerator stocked and consumer spend. We shifted some of our foodservice production to focus on retail and demonstrated the strength and resonance of our brands with consumers. Our performance in core retail categories continues at an incredible pace in both volume and dollars as a result of evolving demand. Our Nielsen results showed gains of more than 26% in the latest 13 weeks, outpacing total food and beverage as well as the top 10 food manufacturers, again, outpacing all of the top 10 food manufacturers. Our retail lines are leading their categories with overall volume share growth of 2% and dollar share growth of 1.6%. Our core business lines, which represent approximately two-thirds of our measured branded retail sales, but now experienced eight consecutive quarters of growth, again, that's eight consecutive quarters of growth. Within the e-commerce channel, because we were well positioned for the increase in online buying, we continue to see significant sales growth and showed strong performance. Similar to last quarter, total e-commerce sales more than doubled versus the prior year as consumer buying patterns evolve with a continued emphasis on click-and-collect and delivery. We expect the strength in e-commerce to continue. Meals away-from-home continue to remain soft during the quarter, but are slowly starting to recover. Foodservice customers have seen varying degrees of recovery with strength in quick service restaurants focused on takeout and delivery. Some have returned to pre COVID-19 levels, which led us to ship some capacity back to historical patterns. Weakness remains in schools and dining channels, which may persist depending upon states reopening agendas. In contrast, in the retail channel, supermarkets and club stores have continued to see gains across our categories. Because of flexibility, within our operations, we were able to convert parts of our foodservice production network to accommodate the shift to retail. Other parts of our network could not be converted during the third quarter. As a result, current buying patterns remain a net negative across our business, and we don't expect to realize full recovery until meals away-from-home increases. As Noel mentioned, our margins for the third quarter included direct incremental cost totaling approximately $340 million related to COVID-19. Indirect costs and additional inefficiencies created by unplanned absenteeism and reduced production across our business segments has not been included in this number. Moving to the segments, I'll start with Prepared Foods. During the third quarter, our Prepared Foods segment produced an operating margin of 7.1% on just over $2 billion of sales. Our retail growth and the performance of our brands were very strong, while our foodservice volumes remain weak driven by COVID-19-related temporary idling and slowdowns. In total for this segment, sales were down 2.6% with volume down 6% and pricing up 3.4%. Despite these challenges, we were pleased that our total household penetration increased in the third quarter with significant gains in Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage, Ball Park Hot Dogs and Hillshire Farm Lunch Meats. Although availability of raw material has started to return to pre-virus levels, the surge in demand at retail coupled with raw material supply shortages has resulted in lower finished goods inventory levels across the network. Some of the tail effects for this shortage will continue to impact us in the fourth quarter. Despite these COVID-19-related inventory challenges, we are pleased to say that the historical inventory issues caused by our ERP system rollout are behind us. Alternative protein remains a top growth priority for Tyson Foods. We saw growth in distribution and velocity during the quarter while introducing two new plant-based protein offerings to market, a spicy nugget and a whole-grain tender, both under our Raised & Rooted brand. We are focused on our new product launch timing to drive category growth in line with customer and consumer needs. Our teams will continue to work with our foodservice customers to provide relevant product offerings that will enable them to adapt to the changing marketplace as the economy reopens. And we will continue to focus our brand investment and innovation to more value-oriented offerings. We are focusing on formats and sizes relevant for rapidly evolving channel dynamics, such as the acceleration in e-commerce. Overall, the Prepared Foods business is well positioned to deliver sustained retail growth even in this dynamic environment. Our Beef segment produced an operating margin of 17.4% in the third quarter on approximately $3.7 billion of sales. We saw large supplies of market-ready livestock during the quarter, but continue to experience production inefficiencies and lower throughput due to our decisions to temporarily idle some facilities in an effort to protect our team members. The combination of large supplies of livestock, production shortfalls and strong consumer demand drove a much wider margin spread. Our Beef business has done an excellent job managing through this uncertain environment, especially in its ability to protect team members while continuing to produce. As foodservice demand softened, we were able to shift parts of our operation to retail. As cutout values rose during the quarter, we offered price cuts to support our customers and preserve demand in both retail and foodservice. Exports are an important compliment to domestic markets and benefit U.S. cattle and beef producers since many exported products are not typically consumed in the American diet. We expect strong exports to continue as the impacts of COVID-19 start to level out in some areas, but we will continue to emphasize keeping domestic shelves and refrigerator stocked. The current environment shows plentiful supplies of cattle coupled with strong demand for beef. The quality of domestic-fed cattle continues to be excellent, allowing us to provide a high quality product for customers with a continued focus on our premium programs is one of our key growth platforms. Moving to our Pork segment. In the third quarter, strong demand and ample hog supplies led to a 9.6% operating margin in Q3 on approximately $1.1 billion of sales. As pork plants were idled or random reduced capacities in order to protect the health and safety of our team members. Hog producers were met with lower processor demand for their market-ready hogs. We recognized how this impacts our producer community. And we have safely resumed operations at or near full scale production to provide them with an outlet for their hogs. Additionally, idled plants and reduced capacity in our pork facilities had impacts on the availability of raw materials for our Prepared Foods business and affected our ability to produce at optimum levels. We directed more product to our domestic channels where we saw strong demand for whole muscle cuts, including pork loins, butts and ribs. Like our Beef segment, exports remain an important compliment to domestic markets and benefit U.S. hog and pork producers since many exported products are not typically consumed in the American diet. Turning to Chicken. This segment produced an operating margin of negative 3.9% in Q3 on approximately $3.1 billion of sales. No part of our business has seen greater COVID-19 impacts than our Chicken segment. We've experienced significant amounts of complexity in the current environment and continue to work through what's proven to be a very dynamic situation. Sales were down during the quarter as a result of lower volume and price. Operating income was negatively affected by the volume decline, costs associated with COVID-19 and $110 million of negative derivative mark-to-market adjustments as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Additionally, we experienced some degradation in our mix as we shifted capacity to serve retail channels and struggled to maintain efficient levels of production. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we responded to the dramatic shift in demand from foodservice to retail, shifting some of our chicken production capacity accordingly. Although this cost is in the form of capital investments and some plant efficiency, we were able to get more meat to consumers when retail capacity was particularly strained. Despite adjusting parts of our operational footprint, the higher retail volumes didn't entirely offset the lost volumes from foodservice and deli. We began the year with positive progress toward operational improvements within our Chicken business, but the impacts of the virus resulted in an operating disruptions that slowed our progress during the third quarter. We prioritize throughput in order to meet customer demand that we expect to resume meaningful progress against these programs if conditions level off. Looking at current market conditions in the Chicken segment, we saw improved results late in the third quarter and into our fourth quarter as foodservice demand started to slowly recover, but retail demand remains strong. In international, COVID-19 affected our regional businesses in different and varying degrees. Our in-country China operations performed well despite disruptions caused by COVID-19 and African swine fever by leveraging its diversified operating model and continuing its strong performance throughout the third quarter. Our APAC operations were able to ship at least some production to retail to mitigate the impact of lower foodservice volume, and successfully execute promotional activities with our key customers. Our business in Europe was slower and experienced more negative profit impacts resulting from higher exposures to foodservice and the impact on that channel from COVID-19. Our international footprint is providing a platform for growth across the enterprise. We are committed to becoming the global leader in protein by serving emerging markets and strategic customers across channels and segments. With recent acquisitions, we have made significant progress towards reaching critical mass in our international operations to take advantage of higher growth demand patterns. It is worth noting that across our business, we are monitoring trade tensions among countries, working with government agencies and evaluating the impact of a potential shift in longstanding trade agreements. Tariffs remain an obstacle, putting the U.S. at a price disadvantage in many markets in which we participate. If tariffs are lifted or reduced, we would likely see an acceleration of already increased global demand for U.S. Pork, Beef and Chicken. In summary, our team members and businesses across the enterprise have shown tremendous flexibility and agility. They successfully adapted to the continued change brought on by COVID-19. The response from our team members has provided consumers with continued access to a safe and affordable food supply, and we will continue to make investments to prioritize their health and safety. Tyson is well positioned to respond to future market conditions. Our strong balance sheet, unique business model, diverse portfolio and scale will allow us to meet the needs of the marketplace. With that, I'll now ask Stewart to take us through the financials.\nStewart Glendinning: Thanks Dean, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by congratulating Dean on his appointment to the role of CEO. I thoroughly enjoyed working with him and know that he is going to do a terrific job. Congratulations, Dean. Now I'd like to start by pulling out a few performance highlights for the quarter. As Noel mentioned earlier, third quarter results included earnings of $1.40 per share and operating income of $760 million. Sales in Q3 were down approximately 8% to just over $10 billion with a 7.6% return on sales. Average sales price for the quarter was up 2.6%. Year-to-date operating cash flows were $2.7 billion. Now as Noel mentioned earlier, our balance sheet is sound. In fact, our liquidity position improved as we progressed through the quarter. As of June 27, our liquidity was $3.1 billion, which was up $600 million from our second quarter. This substantial increase was attributable to strong operating cash flow performance and was partially offset by a reduction in debt, including our $350 million of bonds that matured and were paid off in Q3 and $150 million of dividends, which were paid during the quarter. We continue to emphasize inventory and accounts receivable management to mitigate the businesses cash flow risk during this uncertain and volatile environment. Including cash of $1.4 billion, net debt was $10.7 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.7x for the 12 months ended June 27. Net interest expense was $119 million for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 21% in the third quarter and weighted-average shares outstanding were approximately 364 million. Depreciation and amortization totaled $295 million. Our capital expenditures during the third quarter totaled $283 million. We continue to target an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital with a focus on projects which will support our long-term strategies and enhance our business performance. Plant automation and expansion of our global footprint are good examples of this. It's also worth noting that we have deployed significant capital against M&A over the past few years, and those assets are proving to be valuable now with a lot more value expected in the future. As examples, our Hillshire assets have performed exceptionally well over the past two years, and the increased exposure to retail has been especially important based on recent COVID-related channel shifts. Our investments in expanding our global footprint have increased our ability to serve multinational customers in both foodservice and retail as well as giving us exposure to some of the world's fastest growing protein markets. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impacts including sales channel shifts, the degree of absenteeism and the temporary idling of some of our facilities, we are currently unable to provide segment operating margin guidance. In addition, the accuracy of any outlook we do provide during this call will be influenced by a wide range of factors connected to the course of the pandemic. Now I'd like to provide some additional commentary on our outlook for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind that fiscal 2020 is a 53-week year. However, we've adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks. Net interest expense should approximate $470 million. We project CapEx spending of approximately $1.25 billion for the fiscal year as we progress with building additional processing capacity for case-ready fresh chicken, beef and pork. We may elect to slowdown parts of our CapEx spending, where appropriate to ensure adequate liquidity. Having said that, we expect liquidity for the remainder of the year to remain well above our minimum liquidity target of $1 billion. As the spread of COVID-19 continues to present new and unforeseen challenges to our business, we believe that a heightened degree of liquidity relative to historical levels is prudent to ensure financial strength and flexibility. This coupled with strong operating cash flows and disciplined capital allocation priorities, gives us confidence in our ability to meet our financial obligation. Our capital allocation will continue to prioritize debt reduction. This includes approximately $700 million of senior note maturities in Q4. We do not expect to repurchase shares through the end of the year, except for minor repurchases related to equity compensation plans. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. As Q4 started, we continue to see heightened levels of retail demand, which still only partially offset the COVID-related decline seen in the foodservice channel. While we're not certain the path of COVID, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver profits during this challenging time, and we expect to continue to do so. Our plants are experiencing varying levels of challenges in the current environment, but capacities have significantly improved since the extremes experienced during the third quarter. Our actions taken to ensure the health and safety of our team members will enable us to move capacity closer to historical levels. As a result of COVID-19, we have incurred direct incremental costs based on the broad range of safety measures we have implemented and continue to support, which, as Noel mentioned, totaled approximately $340 million during the quarter. Because some of these initial investments are one-time in nature, and as such, we will provide long-term benefits. We expect that only a portion of the $340 million in Q3 COVID costs will persist going forward. We also incurred indirect costs and production inefficiencies as a result of COVID-19 that have not been separately identified. We will continue to operate our plants with team member health and safety as the top priority. We expect to offset some of these incremental costs through our continued diligence to drive ongoing financial fitness, where we continue to seek out opportunities to remove unnecessary costs from our business. To summarize, despite the challenges to our industry brought about by COVID, we\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to perform during the crisis, and we are encouraged by our long-term outlook. Our broad business model with multiple proteins allows us to meet a wide range of customer and consumer demands across all of the food sales channels. That model is built on a large scale platform, which is increasingly exposed to higher growth rate countries as we expand our geographic footprint and it provides us the capability of serving the largest multinational companies as well as the smallest single outlets. Our balance sheet, liquidity, scale and portfolio of businesses differentiate Tyson from other food companies and position us for long-term growth. We will drive for that long-term growth in all parts of our business as we execute against our strategic plan with a constant focus on maximizing long-term value for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Hey guys, good morning, and congratulations to Dean and to Noel.\nNoel White: Hey Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Really appreciate the color around the COVID costs, $340 million. Obviously, a chunk of that was worker bonuses as well. But just wondering if you guys could give a little bit more granularity on some of the major cost buckets related to some of those direct COVID costs. Just as we start to think about the fourth quarter, what of those could be actually continuing and possibly into fiscal 2021? And then I have a follow-up as well.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Peter, Stewart here. Let me give you a little bit of color. First of all, as you know, of course, the safety of our team members is our top priority. What's good for our team members is, of course, very good for our business. If you look at the $340 million, those represent only the direct costs. And as you rightly called out the biggest chunk of that is the \u201cthank you\u201d bonus. We disclosed that that amount was $114 million. So that gives you a sense of the biggest driver. But there were also in there \u2013 in terms of other big drivers were enhanced benefits and pay that we paid to employees while plants were closed, but they were out. In addition, of course, we had all of the medical costs and the PPE costs. I think if you took those buckets, that would be the biggest chunk. Ongoing \u2013 of course, if you went back, we announced those \"thank you\" bonuses ahead of time. We don't expect the run rates to be at the same level, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what we think that number will look like for Q4.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then Dean, maybe just stepping back from a high kind of strategy level, the priority is obviously going forward with you stepping in as CEO, is going to continue to be on Prepared Foods and growing international. But I think the biggest point of pushback that we've gotten this morning is just around Chicken. Obviously, it's been a very challenged here with COVID and with a lot of the COVID costs going into Chicken, but how are you thinking about prioritizing a turnaround in Chicken? And when should we expect, I guess, for you to come to us with a more comprehensive plan on what a turnaround could potentially look like? Thank you.\nDean Banks: Sure. Thanks Peter. I would say if you consider what we incurred from direct COVID costs and some of the derivative losses and really the disruption from COVID in general. I think our team did a phenomenal job of weathering the storm. We'd love to see a better financial number post, but ultimately the team did a good job in managing a lot of the challenges and uncertainties. What I would say is that clearly some of the COVID costs will fallout over time, assuming that we get the recovery that we'd like to see, and we did see some real progress prior to COVID picking up some operational efficiencies, and then we're going to be going back after that as soon as our operations return to normal. So you'll see improvements in the coming quarters I believe, but it's really too early to tell with what's going on with COVID. The disruption to our mix and related absenteeism has been quite challenging, although we do see absenteeism trends recover.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Bienvenu: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nNoel White: Good morning.\nDean Banks: Hey, Ben.\nBenjamin Bienvenu: I want to ask on the Pork and Beef section of the business. Those segments performed, obviously the market was favorable as it relates to packing margins, but performed pretty nicely given \u2013 or despite how challenging the operating environment must have been for you guys. I know you had a number of plants closed. We've also though \u2013 we've gotten probably a pretty big backlog of live animals coming for the balance of this calendar year in light of what's happened with COVID. So I'd love to hear your commentary on what you think around the input cost side of things looks like for packer margins for the balance of this calendar year. And then I'd also love to hear in light of the most recent cattle inventory update we got from the USDA, just kind of how you guys are thinking about the cattle cycle and we are \u2013 we're in a really strong profitability environment. At what point do you think that starts to taper off?\nNoel White: Ben, I'll take that. This is Noel. As we look into 2021, we're expecting \u2013 well, without COVID, we would have expected somewhat flat supplies, particularly in cattle. Breeding intention on hogs are off a couple of percent, but productivity has been picking up a couple percent, so basically flagged in. So our outlook for domestic availability has previously been roughly flat to perhaps down 0.5% due to continued strong exports. The number of hogs that have been processed over the last few months, obviously, particularly in Q3, they were down substantially. And we don't know exactly, but we estimate someplace in the vicinity of about 3 million hogs did not come to market. So that will continue to work its way through the system over the coming months. And on cattle, there's probably somewhere in the vicinity of about 1 million head of cattle that\u2019s been backlogged as well. Over the course of months that will work itself out. But regardless, we expect adequate supplies, strong supplies of cattle and hogs as we look into our fiscal 2021.\nBenjamin Bienvenu: Okay, great. Thanks. Stewart, you made some comments or Dean, I think you made comments on SAP. Are those costs entirely behind us? You know that they're behind you in Prepared Foods. I seem to recall that maybe the Chicken segment was being impacted by SAP as well. Am I recalling that correctly? And if so, is that cost behind you as well?\nDean Banks: Yes. Our ERP-related inventory write-downs and distressed are normalized at this point. We're still rolling out SAP across the business, but the rollout\u2019s gone smoothly. And we've not seen an uptick on any of the challenging aspects related to inventory that we\u2019ve shown in the past. So we feel like we've got that behind us and on track.\nBenjamin Bienvenu: Okay. Fantastic. Thanks and best of luck.\nNoel White: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Piken: Yes. Hi, good morning, and congratulations to both of you guys, Dean and Noel.\nDean Banks: Thank you.\nMichael Piken: I wanted to ask a couple of questions here. The first I guess is on the Chicken side. I guess, we\u2019ve seen some weakness in commodity, red quarters recently. And just wondering, how much of that is driven by potentially export slowing down or maybe just the inability to de-bone dark meet, but just sort of your thoughts on kind of the overall size of the business in light of some of the weaker commodity prices for Chicken and then how do you see sort of exports trending? And how are you thinking about your own mix within Chicken?\nDean Banks: So our mix was certainly affected by absenteeism and we really wanted to just get food to the American global population as quick as we could. So we had to take some action there for mix. And then as it relates to general operational improvements, like I said, we captured about a $100 million in total operational savings coming into COVID, which benefited us, but looking forward, it's going to take us some time to work through that. In our contract pricing business, we\u2019ll be going into pricing negotiations this fall. I don\u2019t know we'll see any impacts from that coming in the first or second quarter. And then related to exports, our exports have generally been strong. We're seeing ports move. They are somewhat backed up, but we are seeing product flow through, testing at the borders in places like China, and exports in Japan and Mexico continue to be strong.\nMichael Piken: Okay. Yes. And then as a follow-up, just on the red meat side, if you could talk a little bit. I know the daily slaughter rates have come back really strong and quickly. But on the fabrication side, are you guys able to deliver the specific cuts at this point on Beef and Pork to your targeted customers? Or are there still shortages of particular SKUs or things kind of backing on the fabrication side? Thanks.\nNoel White: Michael, I can take that. I can tell you that no, production has largely rebounded to pre-COVID activities. So the SKU and product mix is not being impacted anywhere to the extent that it was through the March, April, May time period, so nearly back to normal. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research LLC. Please go ahead.\nHeather Jones: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nNoel White: Good morning.\nHeather Jones: My first question is on Chicken. I was wondering if you could give us some more granularity as to how much of your capacity you've been able to shift to retail away from foodservice and how that may cause volumes to look going forward relative to what we saw in Q3?\nNoel White: So we're not necessarily calling out the percentages that we've able to ship, but we've seen foodservice recovered about 80%, 90% in general. And so we have obviously strong products in QSRs.\nStewart Glendinning: Maybe, Heather, just a couple of additional facts just to help with your model. If you look back to Q3 last year, retail versus foodservice in Chicken, that was about 50/50. And if you look at that ratio in 2020, that's about 60/40. So you've seen a shift. Obviously, it would have been worse had we not been able to shift some of the manufacturing over to retail. But I think if you look in our Q, you'll get some of that data.\nHeather Jones: Okay. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I was wondering \u2013 so all the initiatives you've put in place as far as healthcare for your workers, et cetera. Just wondering if you could give us your thoughts about the preparedness going into the fall, like, I know there's some concern in the industry about there potentially being another surge and just like, how do you think you're prepared relative to the spring? If there is a surge and workers getting stuck, like, how do you think it will look for you relative to what it looks like in April, May this year \u2013 I mean, April May earlier this year?\nNoel White: Hi, Heather. Thanks. As you know, team member safety is our top priority. You can tell by our numbers. We've invested heavily in a variety of precautionary measures, the protective equipment and stuff that we've put in including temperature testing. That stuff will benefit us in quarters and years to come. You probably also saw the recent announcement that we've really implemented what I would consider a cutting-edge monitoring program. What we get from that is to ensure that we're assessing the health of our team members and making sure that we know what's going on in our plants, but also helps better understand what's going on in the communities. That's really been the key is knowing what's going on in the disease load in the communities. And we've been very open about sharing that with public health officials to make sure that they see what we're seeing, and they're working with us. Also putting a lot of effort to educate and inform our team members about what we're learning about the virus and how it spreads, and we've seen them be very responsive and respond positively to protective measures at home and in their communities. And so I would say we're as prepared as we can be. We are still investing in research, making sure that we very much understand this virus. We\u2019re really working closely with the communities and health officials to ensure that we've got every possible precaution in place.\nHeather Jones: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Goldman: Hi, good morning. Dean, congratulations.\nDean Banks: Thanks Ken.\nKenneth Goldman: Thanks. I wanted to ask \u2013 if we're on similar call like this 10, 20 years from now, you're retiring. What do you want to be known for? What are the biggest changes that you want to see at Tyson? With the obvious caveat that right now is a completely uncertain time for everybody, but I'm just curious about your long-term strategy and the changes you want to implement?\nDean Banks: So for first off, I've been really lucky to get a chance to work with Noel, the entire ELT and the Board for the past three years now. And I've been on the strategy and acquisitions committee and we've all been working closely to make sure that we've got a long-term perspective on the business that not only leads to long-term growth, but also Tyson's position in helping see the world sustainably. So it's 20, 30 years down the road, we know we're going to have a few more billion people on the planet and we're going to have to make sure that we can provide food for them and do it in a sustainable way. And given Tyson's balanced portfolio or investments in alternative proteins and our global footprint, we're confident that we can really take bold position in doing that.\nKenneth Goldman: Okay. Thank you for that. And then follow-up, I'm just curious if \u2013 you guys talked about Chicken margins improving a little bit. Can you give us some idea of the range there? Obviously, you'll have some costs in terms of your mark-to-market or your derivatives that won't repeat. But excluding that, can you just give us some idea how things are beginning so far a month or so into the quarter so we can model a bit more accurately as we look ahead?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes, look, I think \u2013 Stewart here. I think you could probably look at some of the data coming through public data on pricing. I think what that will show actually is a pricing for the moment is a little bit weakened and we saw it in the middle of the quarter. If you look then at some of the big impacts that Dean called out earlier, in the quarter we had $70 million worth of impact on derivatives and on a year-over-year basis that was $100 million. So certainly I can't say what derivatives will do, but that will be a big impact going forward. The other cost that's noteworthy is to call out the $340 million worth of COVID costs. Chicken took a big chunk of that. And as I mentioned earlier, we expected that ran rate will be lower. If I think \u2013 those are probably the big \u2013 that's probably the big factors to call out as we get into this quarter.\nDean Banks: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning, and congratulations to you Dean again.\nDean Banks: Thank you.\nMichael Lavery: Just wanted to touch on the guidance. You mentioned in Chicken and Prepared Foods that you expect a decline in volumes in the fourth quarter. Do we read that correctly that you think beef and pork will be up or just that you're not sure, and can you give some of what the assumptions are around your thinking there?\nDean Banks: Michael, when you say beef and pork will be up, in what terms?\nMichael Lavery: Well, I think it's specific to volumes that you mentioned the expected decline for Chicken and Prepared Foods. And so would we infer correctly that the volumes in beef and pork are expected to rise.\nDean Banks: Well, we're not going to give any guidance specifically on volumes. I mean you can of course, take our comments that we've made this morning. But you could look back of course this past quarter and you'll see that beef and pork had considerable disruption. Noel, earlier talked about the backlog of animals. Of course, we're looking to get our operations back to normal level as quickly as we can. So that's about all the detail we want to give just looking forward.\nNoel White: I think it'd be fair to say though, as we come into Q4 that volumes are in fact stronger than what they were in Q3. So relatively Q3, I'd say the answer would be, yes. We're a month into our Q4 that compared to \u2013 relative to a year-ago. But that's a different question because it depends on absenteeism, but there's certainly enough livestock to be able to run equal or greater numbers in Q4 than a year-ago.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on your comment on ASF, you said it presents opportunities, obviously there's been some expectation of that for some time and it always seems to twist and turn in different ways and of course, overshadowed by coronavirus in some respects. But as you size it up and think of potential opportunities there, do you have any sense of how it's likely to play out or what we should be looking for catalysts there that maybe we haven't seen that?\nNoel White: Mike, I don't think that there's really been any substantial change from roughly a year-ago that ASF continues to spread albeit at a lower rate than I think what it was a year-ago. There's been a substantial reduction in the global hog herd, so there's \u2013 it\u2019s kind of roughly 25%, and the demand continues to be equal or growing. And so our outlook a year-ago is no different today than it was basically a year-ago that continues to be strong demand from basically all parts of the world, including China. So fundamentals have not changed. And I\u2019d just refer back to Dean's comment that from a longer term perspective, we expect global demand for protein to continue to grow over the coming years at a pace greater than what the expansion and production is going to be.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nNoel White: Good morning.\nDean Banks: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: So maybe continuing, just thinking about kind of how the Chicken business specifically is evolving? And I think going forward, it seems like we've got this kind of tension between kind of absenteeism on the worker side and the inefficiencies and production challenges that presents to your, to your production footprint and the ongoing disruption in foodservice markets, and a) way to maybe give us a sense of how those two have evolved over the course of the last three months through July. You've been just a pop those down on the trajectory of where things stand today and the balance of those in terms of margin impact?\nNoel White: Probably won't break out specific margin impact, but what I will describe is foodservice \u2013 I'll start with the latter server with a ladder first with foodservice loans and return somewhere between 80%, 90%, depending upon the channel customer. We've seen some areas of foodservice that are our key Chicken customers performing extremely well at or near break over levels. And so that's performing well in some areas. We do have areas still \u2013 still struggling to catch up, distribution, et cetera. And then remind me again the first part of the question?\nAdam Samuelson: Just absenteeism and the impact that's had on your cost and your production mix through the third quarter into the fourth?\nNoel White: Sure. Clearly we had a big spike and absenteeism related to COVID in a variety of other things. Like I said before, the trim line trim on absenteeism is trending to the positive. So we expect the S&T has an impact on our production to start to return to normal here relatively soon.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. And then my second question, it's a bit more of a clarification, but just going through the disclosure in the queue related to retail sales by segment looks like kind of Chicken and prepared foods, Chickens up 8% year-on-year for retail sales prepared foods up 12? And I'm just trying to think about kind of the implications of that relative to what we see in the \u2013 whether it's the core business lines, your total Tyson, sales change that you put in your from Nielsen, you put in your slide deck. And I know that there's some things aren't deli and some of the tray pack product that can create some noise there, but I'm just trying to think about how to reconcile just the retail component of what you disclose for sales growth relative to sell\u2026\nNoel White: I think difficult for us to sort of take you through the full reconciliation on the call. But first of all, I mean, great performance from the prepared foods team, eight quarters in a row, a shared gain, so that that's not a blood. But having said that that is just all of the branded all of the branded products, primarily prepared foods, but also in chicken as well. If you look at that our core retail lines are about two thirds of the branded retail volume. So just to give you a sense, but of course all the non-branded stuff also is coming through. Most of that is the foodservice. So when you go back to that note in the queue. They moved in retail up driven, which is largely driven by that core retail move and then foodservice sit down because of COVID. Is that helpful?\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, maybe I'll pause, I'll find. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nNoel White: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you. I think you talked about price negotiations beginning for Chicken and the fall. I guess I've been all over CX, that's a target positives and I'll ask a couple of weeks here. The breeding flock is up and yet total demand for Chicken is down because of a foodservice channel. Is there a hope for a stronger negotiating power in this contract season or is this a supply environment that is not conducive to during the crisis we need to get to normal modules.\nNoel White: Robert, certainly appreciate your diligence and looking into the public data. We're just not going to be able to comment on what we'd expect to happen in pricing negotiations, and it's your it's just to really to tell awesome.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And one follow-up. The derivative losses, I assume that's on corn, right, because corn prices fell during the quarter? Or are there other whole grain that's involved for chicken?\nNoel White: No, you are correct, Rob. It was corn, soybean meal, the combination of two.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you very much.\nNoel White: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Theurer: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to follow-up on the Prepared Foods commentary you've made on Adam's question. So I wanted to understand what \u2013 the exact impact wasn't profitability, which clearly was down on a year-over-year basis, but you've mentioned the strength within the retail portion, which is branded and then, obviously, the weakness in foodservice. Could you elaborate a little more on how much actually input cost pressure you had from the raw material side considering that branded piece actually grew by the not branded piece within Prepared Foods declined to understand a little bit the magnitude of the input cost pressure?\nDean Banks: So I won't give a specific number related to input costs, but clearly the increase in pork and beef prices had an impact on our business. As you know, some of our foodservice business primarily is formulaic in nature, and there's some lag related to when the formula is ultimately materialized into our market price. In the retail side and some parts of foodservice, we actually have contract pricing. And the blips in input costs come and go before we actually get back into price negotiations on those products. We're also seeing exceptional demand on the retail side, too. So taking in all of the prices related to what we're experiencing in these report, could have a depressionary effect on demand. So we're focused on growing that category and that's important to us. So not necessarily able to capitalize on the full spike in beef and pork and capture all that margin back.\nBenjamin Theurer: Okay. Perfect. That was good commentary. Thank you very much. And then just one question as it comes back to the beef piece and your outlook into next year, and thanks for elaborating on the cattle you're seeing available. So is it fair to assume \u2013 this was obviously a very strong quarter and we should not assume that to be a normalized margin environment. But thinking everything else equal, what you were initially expecting for 2020 is most likely going to be what we should in a normal environment expect for next year considering the availability of cattle, et cetera. Is that a fair assumption?\nNoel White: Ben, this is Noel. The fundamentals as we go into next year, demand has been strong. Supplies are adequate now. Trying to forecast where margins will be next year relative to this year, we're not prepared to do that. But the fundamentals, Ben, I\u2019d say look favorable with continued strong demand and adequate supplies.\nBenjamin Theurer: Okay. Thank you very much.\nNoel White: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go head.\nKenneth Zaslow: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Noel, best of luck, and Dean, congratulations.\nNoel White: Thanks Ken.\nDean Banks: Thank you, Ken.\nKenneth Zaslow: Just two questions. One is, Dean as you look at your balance sheet, you have more cash than you've probably had in a long time. How do you expect to allocate that? What is the thought behind that and how do you tie that into a strategy?\nDean Banks: Well, I would say for the time being with all of the uncertainty related to COVID, we think it's important to have ample liquidity to make sure that we can adapt. We've invested heavily into capital equipment and a variety of things to make sure that we can service retail versus foodservice as we've seen demand shift in our markets. Stewart, if you want to\u2026\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Ken, look maybe just a couple of other comments. We are very pleased obviously with our liquidity position, but just thinking about the fourth quarter, we do have some cash payments that are coming up. We've got debt of almost $700 million that's going mature this quarter. We've got dividends. We've called out $1.2 billion of CapEx for the year. So you've got about $300 million coming through in capital expenditures. And there\u2019s a number of places in which cash will go out the door. Don't forget also that as we see the market start to improve, then you're going to also see some increased use of working capital. So I think there are a few specific things on the docket that will absorb some of that cash.\nKenneth Zaslow: Okay. My second question is, I know that you talked about the direct costs, but the indirect costs, can you provide the magnitude relative \u2013 I know you're probably not going to give an exact number, but can we kind of size it? Is it bigger than a breadbox, closer to $340 million, something like that of how much indirect cost you think pressured the company's margins? And where was the greatest degree and sort of kind of helping us frame it? And not so much to give away corporate secrets, but it just helps us kind of forecast going forward, if that's okay.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Ken, there's no specific way to give you a number on indirect costs and that's why we haven't called them out. Obviously things like absenteeism causes a huge amount of disruption in our applause, I think Dean spoke to that that obviously does drive very different financial results. There's huge amount of opportunity cost. I mean, just think about it our foodservice businesses way down ordinarily, that would be operating full steam, so very difficult to give you a number. My best advice is to start with the current run rates and then make some assumptions from that. But I think it's fair to say they were significant like sure said it's impossible to quantify because a lot of it is opportunity cost. However, product mix was also impacted in a fairly substantial way. And as far as the degree of impact, it largely is depending on the number of team members that have been in each one of the sectors, pull through has our greatest number of team members. So they were impacted to a greater extent than our other businesses. But it's fair to say that the likely impact was substantial.\nKenneth Zaslow: Would you say that half of it back to normal, three quarters back to normal, it just some sort of barometer. I know it's really hard and I'm not trying to box you into a corner. It's just trying to figure out, the volatility of number of \u2013 this quarter is really not representative of what's going to happen in the future, right? This quarter is an isolated event. I was just trying to figure out if there's a way to kind of start figuring out fundamentals and adjusting it for the inopportune cost.\nNoel White: Yes. Okay. Ken it's really \u2013 it's not possible to do that, but a lot of the inefficiencies were driven by absenteeism as Dean said that the \u2013 that has improved. So we can't give you a specific number of the degree, but it's better than what it was a couple months ago.\nKenneth Zaslow: Correct, and by the way, best of luck everybody. Thank you very much.\nNoel White: Thank you, Ken.\nDean Banks: Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Noel White for any closing remarks.\nNoel White: Thank you for your time today. While the pandemic has been challenging, I'm convinced will come through as an even stronger company. We are the right portfolio, the right resources and the right team to drive long-term performance and shareholder value for a strategy to grow, deliver, and sustain. Once again, I want to thank our team members for their continued efforts during this unprecedented time. There are health and safety are fundamental to our long-term success. Please stay safe and thank you for interest in Tyson Foods.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stewart Glendinning",
            "content": "Thanks Dean, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by congratulating Dean on his appointment to the role of CEO. I thoroughly enjoyed working with him and know that he is going to do a terrific job. Congratulations, Dean. Now I'd like to start by pulling out a few performance highlights for the quarter. As Noel mentioned earlier, third quarter results included earnings of $1.40 per share and operating income of $760 million. Sales in Q3 were down approximately 8% to just over $10 billion with a 7.6% return on sales. Average sales price for the quarter was up 2.6%. Year-to-date operating cash flows were $2.7 billion. Now as Noel mentioned earlier, our balance sheet is sound. In fact, our liquidity position improved as we progressed through the quarter. As of June 27, our liquidity was $3.1 billion, which was up $600 million from our second quarter. This substantial increase was attributable to strong operating cash flow performance and was partially offset by a reduction in debt, including our $350 million of bonds that matured and were paid off in Q3 and $150 million of dividends, which were paid during the quarter. We continue to emphasize inventory and accounts receivable management to mitigate the businesses cash flow risk during this uncertain and volatile environment. Including cash of $1.4 billion, net debt was $10.7 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.7x for the 12 months ended June 27. Net interest expense was $119 million for the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 21% in the third quarter and weighted-average shares outstanding were approximately 364 million. Depreciation and amortization totaled $295 million. Our capital expenditures during the third quarter totaled $283 million. We continue to target an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital with a focus on projects which will support our long-term strategies and enhance our business performance. Plant automation and expansion of our global footprint are good examples of this. It's also worth noting that we have deployed significant capital against M&A over the past few years, and those assets are proving to be valuable now with a lot more value expected in the future. As examples, our Hillshire assets have performed exceptionally well over the past two years, and the increased exposure to retail has been especially important based on recent COVID-related channel shifts. Our investments in expanding our global footprint have increased our ability to serve multinational customers in both foodservice and retail as well as giving us exposure to some of the world's fastest growing protein markets. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impacts including sales channel shifts, the degree of absenteeism and the temporary idling of some of our facilities, we are currently unable to provide segment operating margin guidance. In addition, the accuracy of any outlook we do provide during this call will be influenced by a wide range of factors connected to the course of the pandemic. Now I'd like to provide some additional commentary on our outlook for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind that fiscal 2020 is a 53-week year. However, we've adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks. Net interest expense should approximate $470 million. We project CapEx spending of approximately $1.25 billion for the fiscal year as we progress with building additional processing capacity for case-ready fresh chicken, beef and pork. We may elect to slowdown parts of our CapEx spending, where appropriate to ensure adequate liquidity. Having said that, we expect liquidity for the remainder of the year to remain well above our minimum liquidity target of $1 billion. As the spread of COVID-19 continues to present new and unforeseen challenges to our business, we believe that a heightened degree of liquidity relative to historical levels is prudent to ensure financial strength and flexibility. This coupled with strong operating cash flows and disciplined capital allocation priorities, gives us confidence in our ability to meet our financial obligation. Our capital allocation will continue to prioritize debt reduction. This includes approximately $700 million of senior note maturities in Q4. We do not expect to repurchase shares through the end of the year, except for minor repurchases related to equity compensation plans. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. As Q4 started, we continue to see heightened levels of retail demand, which still only partially offset the COVID-related decline seen in the foodservice channel. While we're not certain the path of COVID, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver profits during this challenging time, and we expect to continue to do so. Our plants are experiencing varying levels of challenges in the current environment, but capacities have significantly improved since the extremes experienced during the third quarter. Our actions taken to ensure the health and safety of our team members will enable us to move capacity closer to historical levels. As a result of COVID-19, we have incurred direct incremental costs based on the broad range of safety measures we have implemented and continue to support, which, as Noel mentioned, totaled approximately $340 million during the quarter. Because some of these initial investments are one-time in nature, and as such, we will provide long-term benefits. We expect that only a portion of the $340 million in Q3 COVID costs will persist going forward. We also incurred indirect costs and production inefficiencies as a result of COVID-19 that have not been separately identified. We will continue to operate our plants with team member health and safety as the top priority. We expect to offset some of these incremental costs through our continued diligence to drive ongoing financial fitness, where we continue to seek out opportunities to remove unnecessary costs from our business. To summarize, despite the challenges to our industry brought about by COVID, we've demonstrated our ability to perform during the crisis, and we are encouraged by our long-term outlook. Our broad business model with multiple proteins allows us to meet a wide range of customer and consumer demands across all of the food sales channels. That model is built on a large scale platform, which is increasingly exposed to higher growth rate countries as we expand our geographic footprint and it provides us the capability of serving the largest multinational companies as well as the smallest single outlets. Our balance sheet, liquidity, scale and portfolio of businesses differentiate Tyson from other food companies and position us for long-term growth. We will drive for that long-term growth in all parts of our business as we execute against our strategic plan with a constant focus on maximizing long-term value for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A. Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Peter, Stewart here. Let me give you a little bit of color. First of all, as you know, of course, the safety of our team members is our top priority. What's good for our team members is, of course, very good for our business. If you look at the $340 million, those represent only the direct costs. And as you rightly called out the biggest chunk of that is the \u201cthank you\u201d bonus. We disclosed that that amount was $114 million. So that gives you a sense of the biggest driver. But there were also in there \u2013 in terms of other big drivers were enhanced benefits and pay that we paid to employees while plants were closed, but they were out. In addition, of course, we had all of the medical costs and the PPE costs. I think if you took those buckets, that would be the biggest chunk. Ongoing \u2013 of course, if you went back, we announced those \"thank you\" bonuses ahead of time. We don't expect the run rates to be at the same level, but we're not giving any specific guidance on what we think that number will look like for Q4. Maybe, Heather, just a couple of additional facts just to help with your model. If you look back to Q3 last year, retail versus foodservice in Chicken, that was about 50/50. And if you look at that ratio in 2020, that's about 60/40. So you've seen a shift. Obviously, it would have been worse had we not been able to shift some of the manufacturing over to retail. But I think if you look in our Q, you'll get some of that data. Yes, look, I think \u2013 Stewart here. I think you could probably look at some of the data coming through public data on pricing. I think what that will show actually is a pricing for the moment is a little bit weakened and we saw it in the middle of the quarter. If you look then at some of the big impacts that Dean called out earlier, in the quarter we had $70 million worth of impact on derivatives and on a year-over-year basis that was $100 million. So certainly I can't say what derivatives will do, but that will be a big impact going forward. The other cost that's noteworthy is to call out the $340 million worth of COVID costs. Chicken took a big chunk of that. And as I mentioned earlier, we expected that ran rate will be lower. If I think \u2013 those are probably the big \u2013 that's probably the big factors to call out as we get into this quarter. Yes. Ken, look maybe just a couple of other comments. We are very pleased obviously with our liquidity position, but just thinking about the fourth quarter, we do have some cash payments that are coming up. We've got debt of almost $700 million that's going mature this quarter. We've got dividends. We've called out $1.2 billion of CapEx for the year. So you've got about $300 million coming through in capital expenditures. And there's a number of places in which cash will go out the door. Don't forget also that as we see the market start to improve, then you're going to also see some increased use of working capital. So I think there are a few specific things on the docket that will absorb some of that cash. Yes. Ken, there's no specific way to give you a number on indirect costs and that's why we haven't called them out. Obviously things like absenteeism causes a huge amount of disruption in our applause, I think Dean spoke to that that obviously does drive very different financial results. There's huge amount of opportunity cost. I mean, just think about it our foodservice businesses way down ordinarily, that would be operating full steam, so very difficult to give you a number.

And as far as the degree of impact, it largely is depending on the number of team members that have been in each one of the sectors, pull through has our greatest number of team members. So they were impacted to a greater extent than our other businesses. But it's fair to say that the likely impact was substantial."

            "name": "Noel White",
            "content": "Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the announcement we made earlier this morning. Later this year, Dean Banks will take over President and Chief Executive Officer of Tyson Foods, effective October 3. I am excited to continue at Tyson in the new role as Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. Tyson's future is bright with Dean at the helm. As our Chairman said in the press release this morning, Dean and the entire executive leadership team have a strong breadth and depth of capabilities and they bring energy and vision to Tyson Foods. Dean has an impressive background in entrepreneurship, technology and the healthcare industry, which makes him ideally suited to lead Tyson in our efforts to integrate advanced technologies into our operations and further our focus on team member health and safety. Dean is the right person to lead our company in the next stage of growth. Dean, would you like to say a few words? Thank you, Dean. Now we'll discuss the third quarter. I want to start by thanking our team members for their dedication and diligence as we continue to navigate the pandemic. This quarter has been full of challenges in the ever-changing environment. However, I am pleased with how we've adapted and adjusted to the circumstances and continue to operate our facilities without layoffs. While we've worked hard to avoid the supply chain disruptions experienced by our livestock suppliers and customers, our top priority has appropriately remained the health and safety of our team members. We've made substantial investments in COVID-19-related safety measures for our team. Earlier this year, we transformed our facilities with a host of safeguards that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance. We purchased 150 walk-through temperature scanners to check workers when they arrive. We supplied face masks, have installed workstation dividers and have more than 500 social distance monitors in our facilities. About 40,000 of our team members or a third of our U.S. workforce has been tested for the virus. Currently less than 1% of Tyson Foods' U.S. workforce of over 120,000 team members has active COVID-19. Tyson Foods has partnered with outside medical experts and public health officials to understand and prevent the spread of the virus and to share what we've learned. We have partnered with Matrix Medical to set up on-site medical clinics at some of our locations. We also supplied more than 300,000 cloth masks to our team members across the country to share with their families, friends, and loved ones. And last week, we announced the launch of a new strategic COVID-19 monitoring program and the expansion of our occupational health staff, including a new Chief Medical Officer position. The new data-driven program was designed with the help of outside medical experts and involves weekly testing of a sampling of team members to monitor for the presence of the virus. It also includes testing of workers who have symptoms as well as those who have come into close contact with others who have the virus. Protecting our team members is essential to the long-term growth and will remain our top priority. Now I'll turn to the third quarter results, which reflect the value of our comprehensive portfolio and operational agility. Dean will take us through the segment results and Stewart will provide detail on the third quarter results. Without a doubt, our third quarter was one of the most volatile and uncertain periods I've seen during my 40-year career in the industry. However, our commitment to team member health and safety and investments in operations and portfolio strategy effectively positioned us to weather unprecedented marketplace volatility while supporting our farmers, ranchers and producers while working to meet our customer needs. Our scale across proteins, products and brands helps to insulate us during the economic cycles, even historically volatile ones enables us to more readily adjust consumer demands across brands and channels. While COVID-19 has had impacts on our business, I am pleased to say that our company has performed well. Our third quarter sales were just over $10 billion, which is about 8% lower than the same quarter last year, driven by 10.6% lower volumes offset by 2.6% higher price. Our adjusted earnings of $1.40 per share were driven by strong performance in our Beef and Pork segments. While Chicken results were weak early in the quarter driven by significant declines in foodservice and deli demand that affected both volume and mix, we experienced a volume rebound later in the third quarter as states began to reopen, and this has carried over into the fourth quarter. Again, the overall strength of our business, despite challenges earlier in the quarter speaks to the value of our portfolio-based strategy. In Q3, we experienced substantial demand for our core retail and branded products, and we work diligently to get as much product to our customers as possible. This demand shift resulted in core retail line volume growth of more than 26% compared to Q3 last year and share gains in those categories. Meanwhile, we absorbed major declines in foodservice, which resulted in a net reduction to overall volumes during the quarter. The retail channel continued to show strong levels of demand in both volume and dollars, and I was pleased to see another quarter of share growth across our core business lines, this makes eight quarters in a row. Another area where we benefit is the strength of our brand, the breadth of our reach and the ability to produce locally in our international markets and responding to the global demand growth and fluctuations. In the third quarter, exports to many parts of the world performed well, including to Japan and Mexico. In-country performance in China remains strong and the impact of COVID-19 within the other countries where we operate has been less than expected. Reduced hog supplies caused by African swine fever continue to present opportunities to fulfill international demand from U.S. exports and in-country production. It's important to note that a large portion of Tyson's export sales are associated with products that don't traditionally fit within the American consumer's diet. This means export markets help serve as a way for us to optimize utilization of livestock. This contributes to the profitability of the livestock farmer who depended on forest supply. In the third quarter, we took a number of actions to support our supply chain. We unilaterally instituted increase in payments for the prices we paid for our cattle ranchers, provided weight discount relief for hog and cattle producers, and capped prices on certain cuts of beef to our customers. Supporting our partners and customers is essential to our business. Now let's talk about the current operating environment. We have enhanced operations to ensure agility, continue to implement automation to improve safety and efficiencies for our team members and deployed technology to meet consumer demand. Because of these investments, we were positioned to weather the impacts of COVID-19 on our channel mix, as we've experienced increased retail and reduced foodservice demand. From a supply chain perspective, our facilities quickly adapt and were possible to new product mixes to take advantage of changing customer needs and market dynamics due to COVID-19. We operate more than 140 food production facilities in the United States. And although some continue to operate at a decrease production levels, the scope of our operations continue to provide us with the flexibility, agility and redundancy needed to support our customers and help keep refrigerators and shelves stocked. This is a clear benefit to our company scale and how we continue our crucial mission of feeding families during this unprecedented global crisis. Despite our strong performance during the third quarter, COVID-19 created significant direct incremental cost for our business totaling approximately $340 million. This does not include the indirect impacts we've experienced such as lower volumes or operational inefficiencies as a result of absenteeism and lower capacity. Our direct incremental costs were primarily associated with ensuring the health, safety, and recognition or our team members, which include enhanced team member safety precautions in our facilities, communication and education within communities, team member bonuses, enhanced benefits and other COVID-19 protection measures. Due to the nature of these direct incremental expenses, our segments were primarily impacted based on the relative number of team members and the degree of production disruptions they have experienced. We know that some of these expenses will continue, likely at a lower run rate, and we know that we will need to prepare to adjust our operation as the virus persist. Even after accounting produced COVID-19-related costs during the quarter, our business continues to show strength and resilience. While COVID-19 has been disruptive, we have a strong long-term outlook for Tyson Foods. Global population income growth will continue to drive an increased need for protein. That's why we expanded the international footprint we've established is so important to our future growth. Our assets, capabilities and products in China, Asia-Pacific and Europe give us the ability to meet that growing demand. Our lessons from Asia's COVID-19 experience also help shorten the learning curve for us domestically. Furthermore, the virus has accelerated consumer demand for food through alternative channels, such as e-commerce. We believe e-commerce demand in grocery and foodservice will remain elevated and we intend to capitalize on the shift. We also continue to invest aggressively in our brands and in automation and technology, as we seek to create new and more effective ways of doing business. In the technology area alone, we've initiated hundreds of projects over the last three years, many of which are both enterprise and scale and focused on automation and advanced analytics. Automation will help drive efficiencies and protect team members in our facilities. We expect these initiatives to generate strong returns as we move into the future. Of course, there is undoubtedly more work ahead of us, we remain focused on continued execution of operational improvements to drive a more efficient agile organization, which in turn enables us to remain nimble and unlock opportunities to grow the business. As we look beyond this year, we are prepared to navigate prolonged pandemic-related uncertainty. We are investing in operational flexibility to ensure that we can continue to meet customer demand while living in a potentially long-term COVID-19 environment. We recognized that our level of future growth is dependent on away-from-home eating occasions, which will be impacted by communities opening up and potentially reclosing. We will thus remain nimble and remain ready to adjust our facilities as demand picks up or shifts. We are managing our business well and our balance sheet and liquidity position continue to show strength as a result of strong cash flow generation. We believe higher levels of liquidity are prudent until we have more visibility in recovery and realization of a new dynamic environment. We can't say how long the impacts of COVID-19 will last, but we've demonstrated the ability to operate while facing the current challenges. Our business is flexible and ready to take advantage of channel and business shifts. We will continue to adapt our business to address market challenges. I believe shareholders will benefit from our strengths, which include our portfolio, distribution channels, dedicated workforce and scale. Now I'd like Dean to give us a recap of our business segments. Hey Peter. Good morning. Ben, I'll take that. This is Noel. As we look into 2021, we're expecting \u2013 well, without COVID, we would have expected somewhat flat supplies, particularly in cattle. Breeding intention on hogs are off a couple of percent, but productivity has been picking up a couple percent, so basically flagged in. So our outlook for domestic availability has previously been roughly flat to perhaps down 0.5% due to continued strong exports. The number of hogs that have been processed over the last few months, obviously, particularly in Q3, they were down substantially. And we don't know exactly, but we estimate someplace in the vicinity of about 3 million hogs did not come to market. So that will continue to work its way through the system over the coming months. And on cattle, there's probably somewhere in the vicinity of about 1 million head of cattle that's been backlogged as well. Over the course of months that will work itself out. But regardless, we expect adequate supplies, strong supplies of cattle and hogs as we look into our fiscal 2021. Thank you. Michael, I can take that. I can tell you that no, production has largely rebounded to pre-COVID activities. So the SKU and product mix is not being impacted anywhere to the extent that it was through the March, April, May time period, so nearly back to normal. Good morning. So we're not necessarily calling out the percentages that we've able to ship, but we've seen foodservice recovered about 80%, 90% in general. And so we have obviously strong products in QSRs. Hi, Heather. Thanks. As you know, team member safety is our top priority. You can tell by our numbers. We've invested heavily in a variety of precautionary measures, the protective equipment and stuff that we've put in including temperature testing. That stuff will benefit us in quarters and years to come. You probably also saw the recent announcement that we've really implemented what I would consider a cutting-edge monitoring program. What we get from that is to ensure that we're assessing the health of our team members and making sure that we know what's going on in our plants, but also helps better understand what's going on in the communities. That's really been the key is knowing what's going on in the disease load in the communities. And we've been very open about sharing that with public health officials to make sure that they see what we're seeing, and they're working with us. Also putting a lot of effort to educate and inform our team members about what we're learning about the virus and how it spreads, and we've seen them be very responsive and respond positively to protective measures at home and in their communities. And so I would say we're as prepared as we can be. We are still investing in research, making sure that we very much understand this virus. We're really working closely with the communities and health officials to ensure that we've got every possible precaution in place. I think it'd be fair to say though, as we come into Q4 that volumes are in fact stronger than what they were in Q3. So relatively Q3, I'd say the answer would be, yes. We're a month into our Q4 that compared to \u2013 relative to a year-ago. But that's a different question because it depends on absenteeism, but there's certainly enough livestock to be able to run equal or greater numbers in Q4 than a year-ago. Mike, I don't think that there's really been any substantial change from roughly a year-ago that ASF continues to spread albeit at a lower rate than I think what it was a year-ago. There's been a substantial reduction in the global hog herd, so there's \u2013 it's kind of roughly 25%, and the demand continues to be equal or growing. And so our outlook a year-ago is no different today than it was basically a year-ago that continues to be strong demand from basically all parts of the world, including China. So fundamentals have not changed. And I'd just refer back to Dean's comment that from a longer term perspective, we expect global demand for protein to continue to grow over the coming years at a pace greater than what the expansion and production is going to be. Good morning. Probably won't break out specific margin impact, but what I will describe is foodservice \u2013 I'll start with the latter server with a ladder first with foodservice loans and return somewhere between 80%, 90%, depending upon the channel customer. We've seen some areas of foodservice that are our key Chicken customers performing extremely well at or near break over levels. And so that's performing well in some areas. We do have areas still \u2013 still struggling to catch up, distribution, et cetera. And then remind me again the first part of the question? Sure. Clearly we had a big spike and absenteeism related to COVID in a variety of other things. Like I said before, the trim line trim on absenteeism is trending to the positive. So we expect the S&T has an impact on our production to start to return to normal here relatively soon. I think difficult for us to sort of take you through the full reconciliation on the call. But first of all, I mean, great performance from the prepared foods team, eight quarters in a row, a shared gain, so that that's not a blood. But having said that that is just all of the branded all of the branded products, primarily prepared foods, but also in chicken as well. If you look at that our core retail lines are about two thirds of the branded retail volume. So just to give you a sense, but of course all the non-branded stuff also is coming through. Most of that is the foodservice. So when you go back to that note in the queue. They moved in retail up driven, which is largely driven by that core retail move and then foodservice sit down because of COVID. Is that helpful? Yes. Robert, certainly appreciate your diligence and looking into the public data. We're just not going to be able to comment on what we'd expect to happen in pricing negotiations, and it's your it's just to really to tell awesome. No, you are correct, Rob. It was corn, soybean meal, the combination of two. Thank you, Rob. Ben, this is Noel. The fundamentals as we go into next year, demand has been strong. Supplies are adequate now. Trying to forecast where margins will be next year relative to this year, we're not prepared to do that. But the fundamentals, Ben, I'd say look favorable with continued strong demand and adequate supplies. Thank you. Thanks Ken. Yes. Okay. Ken it's really \u2013 it's not possible to do that, but a lot of the inefficiencies were driven by absenteeism as Dean said that the \u2013 that has improved. So we can't give you a specific number of the degree, but it's better than what it was a couple months ago. Thank you, Ken. Thank you for your time today. While the pandemic has been challenging, I'm convinced will come through as an even stronger company. We are the right portfolio, the right resources and the right team to drive long-term performance and shareholder value for a strategy to grow, deliver, and sustain. Once again, I want to thank our team members for their continued efforts during this unprecedented time. There are health and safety are fundamental to our long-term success. Please stay safe and thank you for interest in Tyson Foods."

I also want to offer my sincere thanks to the more than 140,000 team members who have given me a warm welcome over the past three years. I've had the opportunity to get to know many of you and your integrity, passion and commitment to feeding the world is a critical part of why I am here. I am honored to lead Tyson Foods as its next CEO and look forward to working with our company's leadership and executing our strategy to capitalize on opportunities for innovation across the protein spectrum.

And finally, thank you to the Board of Directors for entrusting me to lead Tyson into our next phase. Noel? Thank you, Noel. I want to start by echoing Noel's sentiment as it relates to the resilience that our team members have shown in light of COVID-19. I am humbled by the response during this difficult time and it's been both remarkable and extraordinary. I will focus my remarks today on our third quarter results and then provide additional color on each of our segments. Under the circumstances, our performance has been good. Despite challenges and with team members' safety is our top priority, we did everything possible to maintain operations in order to keep customers shelves and refrigerator stocked and consumer spend. We shifted some of our foodservice production to focus on retail and demonstrated the strength and resonance of our brands with consumers. Our performance in core retail categories continues at an incredible pace in both volume and dollars as a result of evolving demand. Our Nielsen results showed gains of more than 26% in the latest 13 weeks, outpacing total food and beverage as well as the top 10 food manufacturers, again, outpacing all of the top 10 food manufacturers. Our retail lines are leading their categories with overall volume share growth of 2% and dollar share growth of 1.6%. Our core business lines, which represent approximately two-thirds of our measured branded retail sales, but now experienced eight consecutive quarters of growth, again, that's eight consecutive quarters of growth. Within the e-commerce channel, because we were well positioned for the increase in online buying, we continue to see significant sales growth and showed strong performance. Similar to last quarter, total e-commerce sales more than doubled versus the prior year as consumer buying patterns evolve with a continued emphasis on click-and-collect and delivery. We expect the strength in e-commerce to continue. Meals away-from-home continue to remain soft during the quarter, but are slowly starting to recover. Foodservice customers have seen varying degrees of recovery with strength in quick service restaurants focused on takeout and delivery. Some have returned to pre COVID-19 levels, which led us to ship some capacity back to historical patterns. Weakness remains in schools and dining channels, which may persist depending upon states reopening agendas. In contrast, in the retail channel, supermarkets and club stores have continued to see gains across our categories. Because of flexibility, within our operations, we were able to convert parts of our foodservice production network to accommodate the shift to retail. Other parts of our network could not be converted during the third quarter. As a result, current buying patterns remain a net negative across our business, and we don't expect to realize full recovery until meals away-from-home increases. As Noel mentioned, our margins for the third quarter included direct incremental cost totaling approximately $340 million related to COVID-19. Indirect costs and additional inefficiencies created by unplanned absenteeism and reduced production across our business segments has not been included in this number. Moving to the segments, I'll start with Prepared Foods. During the third quarter, our Prepared Foods segment produced an operating margin of 7.1% on just over $2 billion of sales. Our retail growth and the performance of our brands were very strong, while our foodservice volumes remain weak driven by COVID-19-related temporary idling and slowdowns. In total for this segment, sales were down 2.6% with volume down 6% and pricing up 3.4%. Despite these challenges, we were pleased that our total household penetration increased in the third quarter with significant gains in Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage, Ball Park Hot Dogs and Hillshire Farm Lunch Meats. Although availability of raw material has started to return to pre-virus levels, the surge in demand at retail coupled with raw material supply shortages has resulted in lower finished goods inventory levels across the network. Some of the tail effects for this shortage will continue to impact us in the fourth quarter. Despite these COVID-19-related inventory challenges, we are pleased to say that the historical inventory issues caused by our ERP system rollout are behind us. Alternative protein remains a top growth priority for Tyson Foods. We saw growth in distribution and velocity during the quarter while introducing two new plant-based protein offerings to market, a spicy nugget and a whole-grain tender, both under our Raised & Rooted brand. We are focused on our new product launch timing to drive category growth in line with customer and consumer needs. Our teams will continue to work with our foodservice customers to provide relevant product offerings that will enable them to adapt to the changing marketplace as the economy reopens. And we will continue to focus our brand investment and innovation to more value-oriented offerings. We are focusing on formats and sizes relevant for rapidly evolving channel dynamics, such as the acceleration in e-commerce. Overall, the Prepared Foods business is well positioned to deliver sustained retail growth even in this dynamic environment. Our Beef segment produced an operating margin of 17.4% in the third quarter on approximately $3.7 billion of sales. We saw large supplies of market-ready livestock during the quarter, but continue to experience production inefficiencies and lower throughput due to our decisions to temporarily idle some facilities in an effort to protect our team members. The combination of large supplies of livestock, production shortfalls and strong consumer demand drove a much wider margin spread. Our Beef business has done an excellent job managing through this uncertain environment, especially in its ability to protect team members while continuing to produce. As foodservice demand softened, we were able to shift parts of our operation to retail. As cutout values rose during the quarter, we offered price cuts to support our customers and preserve demand in both retail and foodservice. Exports are an important compliment to domestic markets and benefit U.S. cattle and beef producers since many exported products are not typically consumed in the American diet. We expect strong exports to continue as the impacts of COVID-19 start to level out in some areas, but we will continue to emphasize keeping domestic shelves and refrigerator stocked. The current environment shows plentiful supplies of cattle coupled with strong demand for beef. The quality of domestic-fed cattle continues to be excellent, allowing us to provide a high quality product for customers with a continued focus on our premium programs is one of our key growth platforms. Moving to our Pork segment. In the third quarter, strong demand and ample hog supplies led to a 9.6% operating margin in Q3 on approximately $1.1 billion of sales. As pork plants were idled or random reduced capacities in order to protect the health and safety of our team members. Hog producers were met with lower processor demand for their market-ready hogs. We recognized how this impacts our producer community. And we have safely resumed operations at or near full scale production to provide them with an outlet for their hogs. Additionally, idled plants and reduced capacity in our pork facilities had impacts on the availability of raw materials for our Prepared Foods business and affected our ability to produce at optimum levels. We directed more product to our domestic channels where we saw strong demand for whole muscle cuts, including pork loins, butts and ribs. Like our Beef segment, exports remain an important compliment to domestic markets and benefit U.S. hog and pork producers since many exported products are not typically consumed in the American diet. Turning to Chicken. This segment produced an operating margin of negative 3.9% in Q3 on approximately $3.1 billion of sales. No part of our business has seen greater COVID-19 impacts than our Chicken segment. We've experienced significant amounts of complexity in the current environment and continue to work through what's proven to be a very dynamic situation. Sales were down during the quarter as a result of lower volume and price. Operating income was negatively affected by the volume decline, costs associated with COVID-19 and $110 million of negative derivative mark-to-market adjustments as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Additionally, we experienced some degradation in our mix as we shifted capacity to serve retail channels and struggled to maintain efficient levels of production. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we responded to the dramatic shift in demand from foodservice to retail, shifting some of our chicken production capacity accordingly. Although this cost is in the form of capital investments and some plant efficiency, we were able to get more meat to consumers when retail capacity was particularly strained. Despite adjusting parts of our operational footprint, the higher retail volumes didn't entirely offset the lost volumes from foodservice and deli. We began the year with positive progress toward operational improvements within our Chicken business, but the impacts of the virus resulted in an operating disruptions that slowed our progress during the third quarter. We prioritize throughput in order to meet customer demand that we expect to resume meaningful progress against these programs if conditions level off. Looking at current market conditions in the Chicken segment, we saw improved results late in the third quarter and into our fourth quarter as foodservice demand started to slowly recover, but retail demand remains strong. In international, COVID-19 affected our regional businesses in different and varying degrees. Our in-country China operations performed well despite disruptions caused by COVID-19 and African swine fever by leveraging its diversified operating model and continuing its strong performance throughout the third quarter. Our APAC operations were able to ship at least some production to retail to mitigate the impact of lower foodservice volume, and successfully execute promotional activities with our key customers. Our business in Europe was slower and experienced more negative profit impacts resulting from higher exposures to foodservice and the impact on that channel from COVID-19. Our international footprint is providing a platform for growth across the enterprise. We are committed to becoming the global leader in protein by serving emerging markets and strategic customers across channels and segments. With recent acquisitions, we have made significant progress towards reaching critical mass in our international operations to take advantage of higher growth demand patterns. It is worth noting that across our business, we are monitoring trade tensions among countries, working with government agencies and evaluating the impact of a potential shift in longstanding trade agreements. Tariffs remain an obstacle, putting the U.S. at a price disadvantage in many markets in which we participate. If tariffs are lifted or reduced, we would likely see an acceleration of already increased global demand for U.S. Pork, Beef and Chicken. In summary, our team members and businesses across the enterprise have shown tremendous flexibility and agility. They successfully adapted to the continued change brought on by COVID-19. The response from our team members has provided consumers with continued access to a safe and affordable food supply, and we will continue to make investments to prioritize their health and safety. Tyson is well positioned to respond to future market conditions. Our strong balance sheet, unique business model, diverse portfolio and scale will allow us to meet the needs of the marketplace. With that, I'll now ask Stewart to take us through the financials. Sure. Thanks Peter. I would say if you consider what we incurred from direct COVID costs and some of the derivative losses and really the disruption from COVID in general. I think our team did a phenomenal job of weathering the storm. We'd love to see a better financial number post, but ultimately the team did a good job in managing a lot of the challenges and uncertainties. What I would say is that clearly some of the COVID costs will fallout over time, assuming that we get the recovery that we'd like to see, and we did see some real progress prior to COVID picking up some operational efficiencies, and then we're going to be going back after that as soon as our operations return to normal. So you'll see improvements in the coming quarters I believe, but it's really too early to tell with what's going on with COVID. The disruption to our mix and related absenteeism has been quite challenging, although we do see absenteeism trends recover. Hey, Ben. Yes. Our ERP-related inventory write-downs and distressed are normalized at this point. We're still rolling out SAP across the business, but the rollout's gone smoothly. And we've not seen an uptick on any of the challenging aspects related to inventory that we've shown in the past. So we feel like we've got that behind us and on track. Thank you. So our mix was certainly affected by absenteeism and we really wanted to just get food to the American global population as quick as we could. So we had to take some action there for mix. And then as it relates to general operational improvements, like I said, we captured about a $100 million in total operational savings coming into COVID, which benefited us, but looking forward, it's going to take us some time to work through that. In our contract pricing business, we'll be going into pricing negotiations this fall. I don't know we'll see any impacts from that coming in the first or second quarter. And then related to exports, our exports have generally been strong. We're seeing ports move. They are somewhat backed up, but we are seeing product flow through, testing at the borders in places like China, and exports in Japan and Mexico continue to be strong. Thanks Ken. So for first off, I've been really lucky to get a chance to work with Noel, the entire ELT and the Board for the past three years now. And I've been on the strategy and acquisitions committee and we've all been working closely to make sure that we've got a long-term perspective on the business that not only leads to long-term growth, but also Tyson's position in helping see the world sustainably. So it's 20, 30 years down the road, we know we're going to have a few more billion people on the planet and we're going to have to make sure that we can provide food for them and do it in a sustainable way. And given Tyson's balanced portfolio or investments in alternative proteins and our global footprint, we're confident that we can really take bold position in doing that. Thank you. Thank you. Michael, when you say beef and pork will be up, in what terms? Well, we're not going to give any guidance specifically on volumes. I mean you can of course, take our comments that we've made this morning. But you could look back of course this past quarter and you'll see that beef and pork had considerable disruption. Noel, earlier talked about the backlog of animals. Of course, we're looking to get our operations back to normal level as quickly as we can. So that's about all the detail we want to give just looking forward. Good morning. So I won't give a specific number related to input costs, but clearly the increase in pork and beef prices had an impact on our business. As you know, some of our foodservice business primarily is formulaic in nature, and there's some lag related to when the formula is ultimately materialized into our market price. In the retail side and some parts of foodservice, we actually have contract pricing. And the blips in input costs come and go before we actually get back into price negotiations on those products. We're also seeing exceptional demand on the retail side, too. So taking in all of the prices related to what we're experiencing in these report, could have a depressionary effect on demand. So we're focused on growing that category and that's important to us. So not necessarily able to capitalize on the full spike in beef and pork and capture all that margin back. Thank you, Ken. Well, I would say for the time being with all of the uncertainty related to COVID, we think it's important to have ample liquidity to make sure that we can adapt. We've invested heavily into capital equipment and a variety of things to make sure that we can service retail versus foodservice as we've seen demand shift in our markets. Stewart, if you want to... Thank you, Ken."

We have a lot to cover today, but I want to start by saying how proud I am of our team members and the work they\u2019re doing to help feed America during this difficult time. I\u2019ll then touch briefly on our operations and results. Dean will go into further detail about our current operations and Stewart will handle the financial update from this quarter. Day in and day out in the midst of the challenges so many families are facing during this pandemic, our team members are going above and beyond to help us maintain a healthy and stable food supply to our nation and the world. From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to all of them. They\u2019re truly central to everything we\u2019re doing right now. Our number one priority is ensuring their health and safety. The only way we can operate this business is for our team members to feel safe, protected, and not fearful of coming to work. It\u2019s why we put in places a host of safeguards and guidelines at all of our facilities to protect our teams. And as we\u2019ve shown in the recent days, we will not hesitate to idle any plant for deep cleaning when the need arises. Simply put, we will not send anyone into our plants to work unless we are confident that it\u2019s safe. And to do that, we have transformed how we operate. Today, if you visit our facilities, you\u2019ll see state-of-the-art health checkpoints at the entrance; and inside, you\u2019ll see team members wearing proper personal protective equipment, including face masks. You\u2019ll also see tools to help with social distancing. We\u2019ve installed partitions on production lines and in break rooms. And we\u2019ve stepped up our efforts to clean and sterilize everything we can. Education is important part of this effort, and we\u2019re doing our best to ensure our team members understand how they can stay safe at work and at home. Soon, team members will have on-site access to COVID-19 testing and other medical care through our new partnership with Matrix Medical Network, a leading provider of mobile health clinics. We also continue to work closely with federal, state and local health and safety authorities. Last week, as you know, the U.S. government recognized the essential work our team members do by reaffirming meat and poultry processors as a critical part of America\u2019s infrastructure. The President\u2019s executive order under the Defense Production Act establishes clear lines of authority and consistent standards that will help us continue to provide American families with the reliable supply of beef, pork and poultry. I\u2019d now like to briefly talk about the state of our operations. Over the last several weeks, we\u2019ve had to idle several facilities temporarily for deep cleaning, and others are not operating at full capacity due to worker shortages. Despite our slower lines and lower volumes resulting from this pandemic, we believe our core business and financial strength position us well to deliver market share and earnings growth over the long term. And while COVID-19 has been disruptive, we do not believe it changes the outlook for a strong future for Tyson Foods. Now, a quick summary of the quarterly results. Second quarter sales increased to a record $10.9 billion. That\u2019s an increase of more than 4% over last year. This growth was driven by volume increases of 2.6% and price increases of 1.6%. Our adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share were driven by typical seasonality, soft chicken pricing and the impacts of COVID-19. In addition, we spent -- experienced $115 million in negative derivative mark to market adjustments that Dean will discuss in further detail. Important to note that we expect to benefit from the physical offsets associated with these transactions in future periods. From a global perspective, exports to many parts of the world performed well throughout the period. During the second quarter, we saw particular strengthen in exports to Japan and Mexico with double-digit increases in our market share. Research data indicates China is reopening its economy, which is encouraging signal of domestic protein disappearance. Lower levels of supply caused by African swine fever continued to present opportunities fulfill international demand. Now, let\u2019s talk about the current operating environment. The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has had a significant impact on our channel mix with increased retail and plummeting foodservice demand. From a supply chain perspective, where possible, our facilities have adapted to new product mixes, which has enabled us to ship millions of pounds per week between channels and has set us apart from many of our competitors. Foodservice customers have also reacted with high levels of innovation and adaptation, focusing on takeout and delivery. In fact, some have only seen minimal volume loss. Supermarkets and club stores have been trying to meet heavy demand, and we\u2019ve been able to convert a number of production lines from foodservice to retail to help meet those consumer needs. The direct impacts of the virus have created operational challenges, including absenteeism, reduced production speeds, and selected idling of plants. The scope of our operations continued to provide us with flexibility and redundancy. This is a clear benefit to our Company\u2019s scale. COVID-19-related pressure has affected parts of the industry supply chain, especially pork. However, our diversity of protein provides our customers with options. In addition, our geographic diversity provided important lessons from China, where we first encountered COVID-19-related issues. This includes ways to maintain health and safety of our people, opportunities to pivot to retail, potential pathways for recovery. We expect current conditions to continue during our third quarter with a gradual recovery beginning in the fourth quarter. However, all this depends on the extent to which businesses and schools are able to reopen. We\u2019re well-positioned to operate during this period and to take advantage of increasing demand during the recovery. Our balance sheet is sound and our liquidity position was strong going into the crisis. It\u2019s been further bolstered by the term loan we closed at the end of Q2 and by focusing on continuing operations and managing costs. Stewart will give you more details. We committed $13 million to support critical needs in our local communities. This includes $2 million in community grants, and more than $11 million worth of food and meals donated by the Company since March 11th. Over the coming days, we\u2019ll make product donations equal to an additional 100 million meals. Despite the immediate challenges from COVID-19 and its associated impacts, we\u2019re maintaining a clear focus on the long term. This includes our strategy to grow, deliver and sustain. Global population and income growth will continue to drive an increased need for protein. And our size, diversity of portfolio and broad geographic presence will give us an advantage. In addition, there are changes which will undoubtedly remain with us after the crisis. For example, we expect continued higher levels of ecommerce for both grocery and foodservice. Our early investments in this space have allowed us to capitalize on the growth, and we expect to benefit further in the future. Our industry is heavily dependent on people, but our companies investing aggressively in automating the most difficult jobs in our processing plants. Our balance sheet, liquidity and scale, as well as our diverse product portfolio of products and distribution channels position Tyson to benefit from long-term industry dynamics. Now, I\u2019d like Dean to give us a recap of our business segments.\nDean Banks: Thanks, Noel, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to start by discussing our response to pandemic, but I\u2019ll spend a majority of my time discussing channel dynamics, current operating environment and the long-term outlook for each segment. As Noel discussed, we\u2019ve experienced multiple challenges during our second quarter related to COVID-19. The response by our team members has been nothing short of heroic, and it makes me incredibly proud to be part of this great Company. I personally visited many of our impacted facilities and witnessed firsthand the steps we\u2019re taking to protect our teams. Local health departments and the CDC have also toured our facilities and have been extremely complementary of the measures we put in place to protect our team members and community. The health and safety of our team members remains our top priority. We took early decisive action to provide workspace distancing, PPE and other protective measures. We\u2019ve had no layoffs or furloughs, and have extended $120 million of bonuses and improved benefits to our frontline team members. This will also allow us to quickly recover once we move past the effects of COVID-19. Now, let\u2019s discuss some channel dynamics we\u2019ve observed in the wake of COVID-19. Each of our businesses has witnessed a profound shift from foodservice to retail. Our retail business remains strong and our core retail lines posted gains of more than 20% in the last 13 weeks, outpacing total food and beverage, as well as the top 10 food manufacturers. While panic buying has subsided from extreme levels, we continue to see 15% to 40% volume increases versus last year, depending on the category. As a result of these trends, we have successfully increased volume, margin and share within retail. Historically, approximately 45% of our total Company sales were the retail, 40% foodservice and 15% international. During early Q3, we saw our retail sales move to approximately two-thirds of our total Company sales. While we were successful in shifting some of our production from foodservice to retail, not all of our facilities are able to do so. The volume increases in retail have not been sufficient to offset the losses in foodservice. And as a result, we expect negative year-over-year volumes in the second half of fiscal 2020. Operationally, we have faced two meaningful challenges, slowdown, resulting from team member shortages or choices we made to ensure operational safety and temporary closures related to COVID-19 infection. We\u2019ve continued to pay team members during the slowdowns and closure since maintaining health and continued employment of our team members is important for our longer term success. As a result, we\u2019ve experienced lower levels of productivity and higher cost of production. This will likely continue in the short term until local infection rates begin to decrease. Within the ecommerce channel, we witnessed significant sales growth including a more than 140% month-to-month growth rate in our core business lines sold to a major ecommerce customer. We expect this trend to continue. Going forward, we expect sustained retail sales growth and a slow recovery in our foodservice channel. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our segments. During the second quarter, our Prepared Foods segment produced an operating margin of 9.2%. Top-line growth continued with the seventh straight quarter volume and dollar share growth. Sales were up 2.6% for the quarter, and pricing was up 2.7%. Within the last 13 weeks, total volume, sales, household penetration and share increased across the core business lines. Historically, 60% of our Prepared Foods sales have been to the retail channel and 40% to foodservice. During Q3, we\u2019ve seen greater than 20% growth in our retail sales. This channel, driven by our strong brands and innovation capabilities provides a highest growth potential and margin opportunity across our portfolio. In the current environment, our retail-centric products continue to show strength, while the current reduction in raw material availability may cause short- term outages. Our ability to flex our production footprint between the foodservice and retail channels is limited. Consequently, we currently believe the full effect of these new consumption patterns will result in a net reduction in volume. Looking forward, our market insight, channel flexibility, access to raw material and growing demand give us long-term optimism. We are responding to the changes in consumer demand by pivoting our branded investments and innovation to more value-oriented offerings and two formats and sizes relevant for rapidly evolving channel dynamics such as e-commerce acceleration. Our retail businesses and brands are well-positioned to deliver sustained growth even if we enter into a recessionary environment. Our Beef segment produced an operating margin of 2.7% in the second quarter. Commodity volatility during the quarter resulted in a negative impact of $55 million in derivative mark-to-market adjustments. As Noel mentioned, it\u2019s important to note, this amount does not include physical assets, which may be recognized in future periods. Our beef business has done an excellent job of pivoting from foodservice to retail and continuing to drive innovation. We found new retail applications for products that have traditionally supplied the foodservice channel, which we believe could generate continued demand even in the post COVID-19 environment. These exports remain strong, posting double digit increases compared to the same quarter last year, which have exceeded industry growth rates. Export markets are an important outlet for us now and in the future. In the current environment, we see strong demand and ample supply of cattle, but reduced industry processing capacity due to COVID-19 has pressured the supply chain and has reduced overall profitability. Temporary plant closings dramatically increased operating costs and weakened what would otherwise be a strong margin environment. As a result of the shutdown, cattle producers are met with much lower processing demand for their fed cattle. We recognize how this impacts our producer community and are anxious to safely resume operations at our facilities to provide them with an outlet for their cattle. Looking forward, we expect clinical supplies of cattle coupled with strong demand for beef both domestically and via export, our relationships with producers, industry-leading production capabilities, and customer-centric solutions gives us confidence in the long-term outlook for this business. Moving to our Pork segment, strong demand solid operational execution and ample hog supplies led to a 7.3% operating margin in Q2. As we transition to a ractopamine-free hog supply, our ability to sell pork to the global markets has expanded. This new capability has been met with increasing global demand as African swine fever continues to reduce pork supplies in Asia. Year-over-year increases of pork to China were up significantly for the quarter, and we expect strong demand to continue as China recovers from this COVID-19 lockdown. In the current environment, we see strong demand and ample supply of hogs, but reduced industry processing capacity of nearly 50% to the COVID-19 has pressured the supply chain and dramatically reduced overall profitability. As pork plants across the country have continued to shut down, hog producers are met with much lower processor demand for their market-ready hogs. We recognize how this impacts our producer community and are anxious to safely resume operations at our facilities to provide them with an outlet for their hogs. Looking ahead, we see large supplies of livestock and strong demand driven by a global shortage of pork. We continue to believe the impact of African swine fever in Asia could generate significant future margin potential. Our Chicken segment produced an operating margin of 2.9% in the second quarter. Operating income was negatively affected by a $40 million increase in net feed ingredient reading costs and negative derivative mark to market adjustments. This along with weaker pricing from increased domestic availability of chicken has offset the benefits of our operational improvement initiatives. Weaker pricing dynamics have persisted into the third quarter. Our Chicken segment has higher foodservice exposure than Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. We responded to demand shifts caused by COVID-19 by adjusting parts of our production capacity from foodservice to retail, but higher retail volumes have not entirely offset the lost volumes from foodservice. Additionally, this channel shift has resulted in lower margin realization as volumes have moved to lower margin products. Also, worker shortages have reduced overall plant efficiency resulting in higher production costs. Due to large domestic supplies coupled with reduced foodservice consumption, we believe our chicken operations are likely to incur losses in the back half of the year. Profit trends will improve as foodservice activity recovers. Turning to our international business. Our China operations were impacted by COVID-19 more than any other region during the second quarter. Despite this, our China team produced record sales and operating income as production was shifted to meet rising retail demand. While China is recovering, other geographies where we produce or sell are being impacted negatively by COVID-19, especially since our international business has historically had a high level of exposure to the foodservice channel. We expect to see a slow recovery across each of our geographies as demand patterns normalize. The profitability will be impacted negatively in the short term. In closing, our businesses across the enterprise are adapting to the dramatic changes brought about by COVID-19 and the response of our team has provided consumers continued access to a safe and affordable food supply. Short-term challenges do not diminish our belief in the Company\u2019s long-term outlook. Our unique business model, diverse portfolio and industry-leading scale will make us stronger and more resilient. Before I hand over to Stewart to take us through the financials, I\u2019d like to thank our 141,000 team members who continue to support our mission of feeding the world. Their health and safety are critical to that mission. Over to you, Stewart.\nStewart Glendinning: Thanks, Dean, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe. I\u2019ll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter. As Noel mentioned, our second quarter results included earnings of $0.77 per share, and operating income of $501 million. Our adjusted results excluded $110 million non-operating gain or $0.23 per share, as we executed the termination of two frozen pension plans by purchasing annuities for the participants. Due to the assets held in the plans, this did not result in a significant cash outflow. We have now exited four pension plans in the last two years as we continue to minimize volatility and cash flow risks associated with pension plans. Sales in Q2 were up over 4% and nearly $10.9 billion with a 4.6% return on sales. Average sales price for the quarter was up 1.6%. Year-to-date operating cash flows were $1.3 billion. As Noel mentioned earlier, our balance sheet is sound and our liquidity position was strong going into the crisis. On March 27th, we successfully entered into a term loan agreement of $1.5 billion, and we borrowed these funds in the first week of our third quarter. This loan ensures financial flexibility and enables us to navigate potential uncertainties in the capital markets, while alleviating our reliance on the commercial paper market that typically serves as our primary means of short-term liquidity. Our liquidity on March 28th, including the undrawn term loan was $2.5 billion and was highest still as of the end of April. During the quarter, we continued to experience some operational effects from our recent ERP system implementation, which impacted margins by roughly $30 million in the quarter. About half of this was discounted sales with the remainder related to inventory write-downs and donations. We believe that we have turned the corner on this issue and expect the incremental costs to ramp down throughout Q3 before returning to historical run rates in Q4. Because of the shift from foodservice to retail, we are closely managing our foodservice-related inventories to minimize any losses and of course, we are working to ensure that our outstanding accounts receivables are collected in this higher risk environment. Including cash of $437 million, net debt was $11.7 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.9 times for the 12 months ending March 28th. Net interest expense was $116 million for the quarter and capital expenditures were $312 million. We continue to target an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital. In the second quarter, we repurchased 700,000 shares for $64 million. Weighted average shares outstanding were approximately $365 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.8% in the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $293 million. Dean has articulated the qualitative aspects of our outlook, which should give you some indication of how we expect our businesses to perform for the balance of the fiscal year. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impacts, the degree of absenteeism and then the temporary closure of some of our facilities, we are currently unable to provide segment operating margin guidance. Now, I\u2019d like to provide some additional commentary on our outlook. Keep in mind that fiscal 2020 is a 53-week year. However, we have adjusted our outlook to be comfortable to 52 weeks. Net interest expense should approximate $470 million. We project CapEx spending of approximately $1.2 billion for the fiscal year as we progress with building additional processing capacity for case-ready fresh chicken, beef and pork. This is a reduction of more than $100 million from our previous guidance. We may elect to slow down parts of our CapEx spending where appropriate to ensure adequate liquidity. Having said that, we expect liquidity in the back half of the year to remain well above our minimum liquidity target of $1 billion, especially after the issuance of the $1.5 billion term loan. Our capital allocation will continue to prioritize debt reduction. This includes approximately $1 billion of senior note maturities during Q3 and Q4. We did not expect to repurchase shares in the back half of the year, except for minor repurchases related to an employee stock ownership plan. We currently expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 23%. We expect to deliver profit in the back half of the year, assuming that we can continue to operate and supply our plants. Q3 has begun with higher levels of volatility. Early in the quarter, we saw huge volume falls in our retail channel. This demand partially offset declines in our foodservice channel. In recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen a leveling off followed by another surge in retail demand. But as Dean has said, the volume shift from foodservice to retail is likely to be a net negative. The major challenge facing us currently is the degree to which our plants are able to operate. All plants are experiencing varying levels of crewing. We will continue to operate our plants with team member health and safety as a top priority. As you can imagine, the slowdowns and temporary closures related to the pandemic drive higher production costs, and we expect to see those until we resume under more normal conditions. Also, our COVID-19 risk mitigation activities have added costs on the broad range of safety measures we have implemented and continue to support. Despite this, we continue to focus on financial fitness and have partially offset some of these impacts. We will continue to seek out opportunities to remove unnecessary costs from our business. T sum it up, our long-term outlook remains positive. Our diversified business model allows us to react to changes created by major events like COVID-19 and African swine fever. Our balance sheet, liquidity, scale and diversified portfolio of businesses remain strong and should provide some level of protection as we move through the year. We will continue to drive the long-term growth in all parts of our business as we execute against our strategic plan with a constant focus on maximizing long-term value for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.\nKen Zaslow: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are staying safe.\nNoel White: Thank you, Tim. \nKen Zaslow: Let me just ask one question and I have a follow-up. One is, can you can you frame the status of your -- Tyson\u2019s operations in each division and the associated costs? So, which divisions are operating at what levels? And how are you complying with getting people back to work, absenteeism? Can you give us a lot of color on that? That\u2019s kind of one of the pressing questions.\nDean Banks: Sure, Ken. First thing I want to say -- and I\u2019m sure you know this, team member safety remains our top priority. And we\u2019re sparing no expense to keep them safe. We are fully complying and been interacting with the government authorities, including the USDA, the CDC, OSHA, and even county and local governments. And we\u2019ve had intermittent outages from time to time as it\u2019s been necessary to make sure that our team members are kept absolutely safe. The expenses related to these closures, I\u2019ll start with PPE. We\u2019ve invested substantially in our protective equipment for our team members, including things like chartering planes to supply masks even before they were mandated by the CDC. We bought some quite expensive thermal scanners to make sure that we can check temperatures for our team members coming in and out of our plants. And other expenses if the inefficiency of the plants driven by the slowing or idling the plants while they\u2019re being checked and while our team members are being tested. Another priority of ours is to keep food on the table of our consumers. And so, that includes running and recovering plants at slower capacities, which from time being but also running them with overtime and additional costs to make sure that whenever we can run them in control, we can put food on the American tables. One expense I can quantify for you is the $120 million in Thank You bonuses we provided to our team members during this time for the hard work. And again, team member safety being our top priority, it is hard to predict the extent of these costs over time.\nKen Zaslow: But, can you talk about the utilization rate? What plants are coming back on line? Which plants are off -- what percentage of your plants are off, kind of given kind of a status of the progression of where you are on your operations on that side?\nNoel White: Yes. Ken, this is Noel. It\u2019s very dynamic. I would say that on the pork side of our business, we did take down our Logansport plant, we took down our Waterloo plant, Perry, which was closed for a short period of time. And each one of those plants are in the process of either coming back up or finishing the testing of all of our team members. On the beef side of our business, we took down Dakota City, which is a large facility for us, this past weekend. We\u2019re working with local county, state and federal officials to bring it back up. We took down our Pasco, Washington plant since two weeks ago, to go through the entire testing protocol. Those test results we\u2019re receiving back through the weekend. So, there\u2019s been various impacts, Ken. We will take the plant down for a period of time, and the period of time is varied, anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Does that give you a sense?\nKen Zaslow: Yes. And then, my follow-up question is, you guys wrote in the press release that you think chicken prices will not go up. Let me just frame this and help me understand where I\u2019m wrong. We have less chicken production, we have less beef production, we have less pork production, we potentially will have less hogs, we potentially might have less cattle, and we do still have a shortage of protein globally. How do you expect chicken prices to not go up in that scenario? What am I missing? And I get the demand shift. But, I think that\u2019s more fluid.\nNoel White: Ken, it really depends on the assumptions. And our assumptions is that plants will come back up as we go through Q3 and Q4. And it\u2019s really the impacts of each one of those, the poultry plants, pork plants, beef plants. Total animals available, as you know, it\u2019s up year-over-year, 4-plus-percent. So, we\u2019re assuming that these plants, not only ours but others will, in fact, they\u2019ll go down for a period of time and then reopen. So, we are actually looking at an increase in total protein available as we go through the balance of Q3, Q4.\nDean Banks: Ken, I would just add that mix plays a really strong role in this. As you probably know, a substantial portion of our business has been in foodservice, which is down. And our retail business is up. But as we mentioned in the call, those do not perfectly counterbalance. And so, that will also have an impact on our long term blended sale price.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: So, I\u2019d like to actually follow up on the chicken situation. So, in the past, we\u2019ve always seen in your case a little less volatility, just because of the way you price through. And I understand that foodservice is substantially under pressure and you can\u2019t offset that for retail. But, could you walk us a little through your relationship with the different customers feed and retail and foodservice, what you\u2019re seeing on the featuring side, and how you think of pricing those products towards back half of your fiscal year?\nDean Banks: Sure. Our retail customers have been phenomenally supportive. And we continue to work with them as we always would, and we\u2019re not planning to take price increase there. As it relates to foodservice specifically, we have seen some of our customers really get decimated due to the COVID crisis and closure of restaurants, limited supply in deli and that sort of thing. We have seen some of our customers, specifically QSRs recover very well. Their model of having takeout food and drive-thrus, have really allowed them to be resilient and continue to thrive in the market.\nBen Theurer: Okay. And then, my follow-up is more of a medium long-term question. So clearly, and you\u2019ve mentioned it in your prepared remarks, there\u2019s currently a significant decrease in demand from a processing point of view on pork and beef, which obviously causes all the farmers to basically stick with the animals. What is your expectation in terms of cattle hog supply looking out a couple of years from now and in terms of potential reactions from farmers on the loss making? And how are you actually paying your suppliers, the farmers when you buy off? Do you really get the benefit of the low live cattle and live hog prices right now or do you not see that much of a benefit coming through because you\u2019d rather look long-term and want to support the farmers in the short-term to basically secure supply in the medium long-term?\nNoel White: Yes, Ben. Let me tell you, first of all, we believe it\u2019s critically important that our livestock suppliers thrive and continue to be profitable. So, we\u2019re doing everything possible to process as many animals as possible to make sure that there is a market for those animals. Longer term outlook, Ben, it\u2019s truly dependent on the closures of plants over the course of the next 60 to 90 days. There has been a backlog of inventory that\u2019s developed with both, hogs and cattle, and that will continue if plant closures continue at the pace that we\u2019re at right now. Longer term, I would say that -- on pork, it really depends on the degree of liquidation that we see over the course of the next 90 days. So, if, as an example, the weaned or baby pigs are in fact euthanized, that will have an impact sometime later this calendar year; if the sows, if the mothers are liquidated, then that has longer term implications that goes out over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. We\u2019re not seeing the same thing happen with cattle yet. A lot of the cattle are still in pasture or been on feed for a number of days. The weight is increasing, but it\u2019s not at the critical point that pork is at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: I just wanted to follow up actually on Ken\u2019s initial question just around the cost. Obviously, it\u2019s helpful to have the detail on $120 million in bonuses. And Dean, you outlined a number of other costs in terms of medical equipment or PPE math. I mean, is there any way at least at this point to quantify that and to the extent that you\u2019re willing to say? On a go forward basis, I mean, some of these costs are going to be recurring. I mean, is it fair to assume that there\u2019s now just structurally higher costs in the business, and we\u2019ve kind of changed from a paradigm standpoint, in terms of the equipment we need in plants for employees?\nDean Banks: So, I\u2019ll just mention a few things here is that as this disease has progressed, as we\u2019ve learned more, anything that we can find or discover that can improve safety in our facilities, we are doing. And when it comes to the long-term structural cost of the business, there are some things that we\u2019re installing now. For example, these thermal scanners that will -- we will leave installed and they\u2019ll provide even benefit whenever we move into the next flu season to just help our team members better understand, they\u2019re starting to develop sickness early and that sort of thing. But no, it\u2019s not possible to really quantify or put a number on what those costs are going to look like related to COVID-19.\nPeter Galbo: And one of the other things you guys spoke about was automation, moving to put as much automation into plants as much as you can, as quickly as you can. Can you maybe just rank order for us among the four kind of top segments, from top to bottom, most automated, the least automated and to that extent, is it 25% of the operations are automated, 50% of the operations are automated? Any color there would be helpful.\nDean Banks: I think, it\u2019s difficult to describe in a lot of ways, because some of our plants have expenses -- scaled equipment for things like producing ground beef and sausage and that sort of thing. We do have some robotic automation and things like palletizing and that sort of thing. The thing that I would stress is that automation provides really a lot of things, but one of the things that I would stress is flexibility where we had installed some Multivac vacuum packaging systems for products like beef and pork. What we\u2019ve seen is that those businesses\u2019 ability to very quickly shift those products from retail or from foodservice to retail, which has been really beneficial to those businesses. But, it\u2019s difficult to really put a percentage on automation across each of the business units.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess, my first question goes back in the prepared remarks. I believe the comment was the expectation for chicken business with the operating losses for the balance of the fiscal year. And I\u2019m just trying to maybe break that apart a little bit and tie it into some of Ken\u2019s questioning. Just can you help think about that from a kind of commodity price outlook versus volume versus mix versus operating costs? Just help us think about how we\u2019re going from where we\u2019ve been on margins to losses, and just think about the drivers, so that we can watch the market evolve and assess your performance against?\nNoel White: Sure. You\u2019re accurate. That was in the prepared remarks. Based on what we see right now in the marketplace, as I mentioned on an earlier question that we are in fact expecting an increase in protein supplies through the balance of this, at least fiscal year, like the calendar year. And with that, there will likely be as there has been the last few months an oversupply of poultry in the market. Total number of animals available has not changed at this point. So, whether it\u2019s beef, pork or Chicken, we\u2019re looking at increased supply. So, most recently in the -- over the course the last couple weeks, there have been some shortages in some specific categories. However, in total, as we go into Q4, we expect supplies to be increasing and therefore not any pricing recovery.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. And then, I guess, my follow-up is -- it\u2019s more broad across the business. In the face of some pretty unprecedented kind of volume and throughput issues that you\u2019re facing around labor availability, can you just help fame, in the businesses, kind of what percentage of costs that are fixed? And in this period, I presume labor is going to be the single biggest fixed cost, just to help us think about the volume decrementals that you\u2019d be experiencing in the face of the throughput challenges that you have?\nNoel White: Each plant is a little different. So, it\u2019s hard to give you a precise number. I can tell you, it\u2019s significant in the millions of dollars per week in some of our larger facilities such as some of our beef and pork operations; poultry, not the same extent but still expensive; and then, we have a number of plants that we operate in our Prepared Foods space that we\u2019ve not seen a big impact. And we certainly hope that that continues. So, each plant is a little bit different, depending on which plant we need to take down and how long.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research LLC. Please go ahead.\nHeather Jones: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow up on the chicken pricing comment. So, is that a Tyson-specific comment? And also, you mentioned mix, but is there also an element of you guys have cost-plus contracts and clearly see costs are down. So, is that a component and -- for that comment as well?\nNoel White: Well, anytime we make any comments, Heather, it is specific to Tyson. Obviously, we don\u2019t know what others in the industry are going to do. All we can do is look at industry data. So, yes, the outlook is specific to us. And, we can look at egg sets, we can -- placements. We can look a lot of different numbers, and we have no sense what others going to do. That\u2019s purely our outlook at this point in time.\nHeather Jones: To my question, does that include some effect to cost-plus contracts given lower fees?\nNoel White: Cost-plus lower -- yes, it would be passed through in the cost-plus contract. Yes. Alternatively, if costs go up, price goes up; cost inputs go down, price goes down.\nHeather Jones: Okay. My follow-up question is on the production side, or volume side I should say. I realize when the Beef and Pork side is going to be a function of how soon you guys are able to get those up and fully running, but on the Chicken side, how should we be thinking about volumes on that front for the back half?\nNoel White: Different plants have been impacted to different extents. I would say, Heather, so far, we have had some disruption at a couple of our facilities that we\u2019ve taken them down for a relatively short period of time, days or week. And we don\u2019t know obviously, what the effect is going to be in the future. We are and will continue to work with all the local, county, states and federal officials to make sure that our team members are safe. So, at this point, we\u2019ve not seen a tremendous impact on our poultry business. And obviously, we don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to look like over the course of the next three to six months.\nHeather Jones: So, you aren\u2019t able to ballpark what your Chicken volumes will be, up or down year-on-year in the back half?\nNoel White: It\u2019s just total production, we think will be up, as I mentioned earlier.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: So, I guess, my question is, are you able to go segment by segment and tell us roughly what the mix is between foodservice and retail? And then, give us an idea of how much the retail is down at the moment, post the panic buying period, so I guess April, versus obviously foodservice, how is that down; and retail how much is that part across Beef and Chicken and Prepared Foods as well? And then, I have a follow-up.\nNoel White: Okay. Alexia, I don\u2019t have the numbers at hand by a specific poultry group. However, as Dean said in his remarks, retail is up, it\u2019s up sharply. And it depends on the week, depends on the months I think in terms of 30% to 40% up. Foodservice is recovering, I would say. And each -- within foodservice itself, each sector is down to varying degrees. So, down in rough numbers, 25% to 30% on foodservice in total, but it does vary substantially depending on the type of the foodservice establishment.\nDean Banks: If you take a look at our segment data in the Q, you get some sense of what are his historic numbers have looked like by channel. So, that doesn\u2019t give it to you by segment, but it\u2019ll give you a good sense of what the various volumes are on exposure to foodservice. If you apply some of the percentages that Noel has suggested to that, I think it\u2019ll give you -- it\u2019ll give you a sense. But, bear in mind that when you look at that, one of those channels is industrial, and part of that is going to be foodservice. So, we sell on to somebody else that then processes for foodservice. But, I think that\u2019s the best place to look.\nAlexia Howard: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then, to follow up, obviously, you can\u2019t give guidance for the next quarter, but a third of the way into it. You mentioned the chicken profits are likely to be I think negative in the back half of the year. Can you give us any sort of idea of how things are looking so far in the first quarter?\nNoel White: I\u2019d says, it\u2019s too early for us to do that. And like I said, it is very fluid. So, on a given day and given week, it can change substantially. So, I\u2019m not comfortable in making any comments today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nKen Goldman: I wanted to dig in on the comment that you expect chicken production to be up in the back half of your fiscal year. I think, that\u2019s a critical point here, because we\u2019re already seeing exits way down. We\u2019re seeing chicks place numbers down even more. So, there\u2019s eggs being cracked. There are some at least rumors about some in the industry, ordering fewer pullets and maybe killing off heavy hens at a faster rate. If that\u2019s already happening and I\u2019m asking if it is, as far as you can tell, and if the industry is margin negative, why would the industry increase production in the back half of the year? I understand part of it is because plants are coming back on line, I do get that. But I don\u2019t quite get why we would assume that given all this what\u2019s happening already that industry production wouldn\u2019t be a little bit less than what we thought previously. Maybe I can just pause there and hear what you say about that. Thanks.\nNoel White: Yes. And that very well could be the case. We look at the public data just like you do. We\u2019re starting to see indications that there have been some cutbacks. We don\u2019t know what others are doing. But, given the profit structure right now, I\u2019d say that certainly could be the case. We don\u2019t know. But, I think as you know, in poultry business, it can change much quicker than what it would be in both pork and beef. S, the things that -- the promises that you\u2019re proposing could in fact play out that way.\nKen Goldman: Okay. And then, my follow-up -- thank you for that. My follow-up is on a little bit about the nature of the industry, whereby labor is such a big part of the cost basis. And when you think about other production facilities, because if I walk around a Hershey plant or a Kellogg plant, I mean, there\u2019s nobody that you can see, except a couple of people, making sure that the boxes aren\u2019t falling off the line. If you look around a chicken plant, it\u2019s wall-to-wall people. And I know you guys are doing everything you can to prevent it from being a problem to your plant. But, as we think about going forward, how do we potentially reduce the number of people in your plants? Is there a way -- I know, the industry has tried for years to get better at automation. Is it more of a priority now for you or for the industry to automate some of these production factors, or is it just something that the nature of meat is that you can\u2019t do it? It\u2019s more specialized, part by part. So, I\u2019m hoping that makes sense. I\u2019m just curious for what your thoughts there and what opportunity is?\nNoel White: Ken, as I mentioned, probably close to a year ago that we started investing fairly heavily in technology, automation, and that hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to invest in that segment. I do think that over the course of a time that the amount of automation will in fact, continue to increase, particularly, in some of the more difficult jobs and positions. I can tell you that, we as an example, we\u2019ve invested a significant amount of money I would say in our attempt to minimize any foreign objects where we\u2019re using vision technologies to try and identify anywhere --we\u2019re working in the debone area, within poultry, we have a number of initiatives within beef and pork. So, I believe it\u2019s not only us as a company, I think the industry will continue to look for solve through automation. So, I think it will probably -- it will likely accelerate from this point.\nKen Goldman: Okay. Thanks so much.\nNoel White: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nNoel White: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: You do have good channel split, even by segment in your full year filings. And so, just curious, within foodservice, you mentioned that a range of performances of how those customers are doing. Can you give us a sense of who\u2019s faring the best? And how you forecast, given how they compare, and just what some of that landscape looks like?\nDean Banks: Hi. This is Dean. We\u2019re not going to be able to comment on a customer by customer basis. What we\u2019re hoping for is a relatively U-shaped curve, long U-shaped curve coming out of this crisis, which will be really beneficial to the small business owner restaurants and distributors. We\u2019d love to see their business really start to recover in the coming quarters, especially as states start to open up. As it relates to who is faring best. As I said before, our QSR customers are really those that are outperforming, because of the flexibility of their model in both historical abilities, either delivered through click and collect, takeout, drive-thru, et cetera.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, back on chicken, I was just curious, maybe how much visibility you have and specifically things like what amount of the pressure on margins is one-time, say the worker bonuses for example. And should we expect losses in both quarters? I know you\u2019re talking about it in aggregate. Just any sense of maybe, given at least what you know now, how you think that plays out?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Look, I mean, we\u2019re not going to give you quarter by quarter. We wanted to make sure that we highlighted the back half of the year. And I think, look, when you stand back and look at Chicken for a second to say, first of all, there is a net negative in volume; second is a margin impact as a result of switching from foodservice; and third, you\u2019ve got some incremental costs, which relate both to some of the onetime worker costs and also more inefficiency in the plants as we try to run them in this environment. Those last two are big numbers, and I do not think that those are with us permanent.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Piken: Yes. Hi. I just wanted to get your sense in terms of, I know you mentioned that you -- some of the hogs are being backed up or whatever. But by the time, let\u2019s say all the workers came back with all the social distancing and things needed to maintain workers\u2019 safety, I mean, what do you think, is either an industry or your capacity utilization rate that we could expect in Pork and at the Beef perhaps relative to maybe where it was pre-COVID-19? Can you get back to kind of those same daily kill rates that we saw three months ago?\nNoel White: Assuming that the plants continue to operate, Michael\u2026 \nMichael Piken: Yes. Assuming the plants are operating, let\u2019s say the workers were willing to show up due to do the safety, like, could we get back to where -- I mean, could we be doing 2.8 million hogs a week?\nNoel White: The answer would be yes. Over the course of last number of years that pork industry has been growing between 2% and 4% per year. The industry infrastructure is set up to deal with that number of hogs. So, yes, we can certainly get back to those types of numbers.\nMichael Piken: Okay. And then, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that Beef has a potential to be quite profitable in the back half of year, but you didn\u2019t really comment too much on Pork. Is it just because the operating rates are lower in Pork that you are less confident on that side of the business, or was I reading your remarks wrong or the lack of commentary?\nNoel White: No, there is nothing intended by the lack of comments there, Michael. If the plants get back up and running as we expect them to be, we would expect that the margin structure within Pork to continue at fairly healthy numbers. Year-to-date, we\u2019re just short of 11% return on sales or Q2 is a little over 7%. So, I think that it\u2019s certainly possible that we\u2019d able to maintain those types of numbers as we look forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse.\nRob Moskow: A couple of questions. I think, Noel, you just said that you think the industry could get back to 2.8 million pigs per week, if attendance improves, but you\u2019re also implementing more social restrictions in the plants and more safety precautions. And I got to imagine that that slows down facilities as well. So, is it possible to break down your incremental costs and your utilization rates based on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of attendance right now? And then, also in terms of the safety measures you need to put in place, because I got to imagine the safety measures are going to be with us for a while?\nNoel White: Yes. I think, that\u2019s a fair assumption, Rob. I think that the slowdown in speeds and production throughput, Robert, it -- we\u2019ve done everything possible to protect all of our team members, all of our employees, including social distancing. And I\u2019d say, it\u2019s too soon to tell at this point, if in fact, that\u2019s a permanent structural change, where we would have to slow down a line to have the social distancing that\u2019s needed. So, we can\u2019t quantify specifically what that might mean going forward. We\u2019re still working through with all the -- both the state and federal officials as to what that might look like going forward.\nRob Moskow: Well, you\u2019re doing it right now, aren\u2019t you? I mean, you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re taking all these precautions right now. It\u2019s obviously the right thing to do. Have you made any estimates as to the degree to which that slows down the facilities and reduces utilization?\nNoel White: We know specifically what that means right now, Rob. But, we\u2019re a company that continuously innovates and work on better processes, and that continues to be the case. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate to think that what we\u2019re doing today necessarily has to be the case, let\u2019s say, 12 months from now.\nRob Moskow: And then, a follow-up. You said that chicken margins are likely to be negative in the back half. Is it possible there to kind of isolate the degree to which that has to do with just excess supplies on the market versus incremental operating costs at the plants for safety and also the absenteeism?\nStewart Glendinning: So, first of all, we didn\u2019t say that margins will be negative. We said that chicken would likely be unprofitable in the backdrop of the year. And I think just a couple questions ago, I sort of framed that. There\u2019s a combination of factors. And the only one that I didn\u2019t point to just because it\u2019s ongoing is weaker pricing. But, if you go back and just look at those factors, the ongoing weaker pricing that we\u2019ve seen, the negative impact of loss of volume, the mix shift between foodservice and retail, and then, of course, just the efficiency levels in the farm, which have been impacted by worker availability, by some of the measures that we\u2019ve taken and then of course the bonuses, that sort of frames out the picture in chicken. I can\u2019t give you any more detail than that.\nRob Moskow: Stewart, can you help me understand what you meant by unprofitable then? If it\u2019s not negative margins, what does it mean?\nStewart Glendinning: Well, I\u2019ve assumed, when you said margin, then you were thinking about gross margin. But, if you think about operating margin, then that\u2019s true. I was saying, it\u2019s going to be unprofitable at the operating income level.\nRob Moskow: In that case, we\u2019re both in line. That\u2019s just what I meant. Okay.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. We\u2019re lined up.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to ask about the executive order. I think, it was helpful in standardizing the processes and procedures around which you guys would open across various states and counties and facilities across the industry. I\u2019m wondering what else it does. I think, there\u2019s been some reference to potentially defraying PPE costs, liabilities. If you could elaborate on kind of the benefits or what that executive order brings to you guys and the rest of the industry from a cost perspective, as well as clarifying the operating procedures?\nDean Banks: Hi. This is Dean. I\u2019ll stress -- your first point is really -- cannot be understated. So, -- it cannot be overstated. The uniformity with which our plants are governed, really being dictated by the experts, the CDC, the OSHA, USDA, is critical for us to both maintain industry standards high. We\u2019ve actually had a few of our plants visited by folks like state government health officials and CDC. And they\u2019ve actually asked to work with not only food industries coming back on line, but also other industries to show them how we\u2019ve taken care of our team members. The second point about PPE, we moved very, very quickly, early in the process to secure PPE for our team members. But those go quickly in our business. And so, the other benefit of the executive order is really to make sure that we have long-term abundant supplies depending on how long this pandemic ultimately lasts, things like masks, hairnets et cetera. We\u2019ve gone so far and sometimes just gave out masks to team members so that they can operate in their community where they know that there may be some latent disease, so that they can operate safely in the community and not bring that back into the plant. So, those are really the two main benefits of the order.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. And you made some allusions to export and how those have fared year-to-date and kind of your outlook of it. But I\u2019m curious. I know it varies by protein segments. But do we need to see higher crude oil prices and a weaker relative dollar in more stable global environment in the context of COVID to see exports improve, or do you think that we can see significant improvement in exports exclusive of those factors?\nNoel White: I think we can see they\u2019re exclusive of those factors, Ben that exports year-to-date have been strong, interest continues to be strong despite very low oil prices. So, the global fundamentals that we\u2019re looking at 6 to 12 months ago haven\u2019t changed, that global protein demand still continues to grow at about a 2% rate. Production volume is not increasing at the same level. United States historically has been a low-cost supplier of protein, beef, pork and chicken to global market. So, we don\u2019t see that changing. And the demand that we\u2019ve seen over the course of the last 30 to 60 days, I think this just reinforces that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re encouraged on a long-term basis of the outlook. That hasn\u2019t changed. We have the headwinds and challenges in front of us right now that we deal with. And as long as we make sure that our team members are safe in our plants. That\u2019s priority number one. Priority number two is making sure that this Company is positioned for the long term over the course of the next 10-20-50 years to continue to be successful. So, we\u2019re not only dealing with the short term, but we also are deeply -- we\u2019re deeply -- we view the long-term on -- take it very, very seriously.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, thanks. Be well and best of luck.\nNoel White: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Noel White for any closing remarks.\nNoel White: Thank you for your time today. One of the hallmarks of Tyson is turning insights into actions. The current environment presents significant opportunities for our Company as we assess and react to changes in the consumer landscape. We\u2019ll leverage our resources and infrastructure as we continue our role as a leader in food production. Let me conclude by saying, the responsibility of feeding our nation goes beyond anyone business. Working together, we\u2019re confident we can mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our communities and keep it away from our plants and help the food supply chain intact. Please stay safe. And we look forward to talk to you soon.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Dean, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe. I'll start my remarks this morning by calling out a few highlights from our performance for the quarter. As Noel mentioned, our second quarter results included earnings of $0.77 per share, and operating income of $501 million. Our adjusted results excluded $110 million non-operating gain or $0.23 per share, as we executed the termination of two frozen pension plans by purchasing annuities for the participants. Due to the assets held in the plans, this did not result in a significant cash outflow. We have now exited four pension plans in the last two years as we continue to minimize volatility and cash flow risks associated with pension plans. Sales in Q2 were up over 4% and nearly $10.9 billion with a 4.6% return on sales. Average sales price for the quarter was up 1.6%. Year-to-date operating cash flows were $1.3 billion. As Noel mentioned earlier, our balance sheet is sound and our liquidity position was strong going into the crisis. On March 27th, we successfully entered into a term loan agreement of $1.5 billion, and we borrowed these funds in the first week of our third quarter. This loan ensures financial flexibility and enables us to navigate potential uncertainties in the capital markets, while alleviating our reliance on the commercial paper market that typically serves as our primary means of short-term liquidity. Our liquidity on March 28th, including the undrawn term loan was $2.5 billion and was highest still as of the end of April. During the quarter, we continued to experience some operational effects from our recent ERP system implementation, which impacted margins by roughly $30 million in the quarter. About half of this was discounted sales with the remainder related to inventory write-downs and donations. We believe that we have turned the corner on this issue and expect the incremental costs to ramp down throughout Q3 before returning to historical run rates in Q4. Because of the shift from foodservice to retail, we are closely managing our foodservice-related inventories to minimize any losses and of course, we are working to ensure that our outstanding accounts receivables are collected in this higher risk environment. Including cash of $437 million, net debt was $11.7 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.9 times for the 12 months ending March 28th. Net interest expense was $116 million for the quarter and capital expenditures were $312 million. We continue to target an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital. In the second quarter, we repurchased 700,000 shares for $64 million. Weighted average shares outstanding were approximately $365 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.8% in the second quarter, depreciation and amortization was $293 million. Dean has articulated the qualitative aspects of our outlook, which should give you some indication of how we expect our businesses to perform for the balance of the fiscal year. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impacts, the degree of absenteeism and then the temporary closure of some of our facilities, we are currently unable to provide segment operating margin guidance. Now, I'd like to provide some additional commentary on our outlook. Keep in mind that fiscal 2020 is a 53-week year. However, we have adjusted our outlook to be comfortable to 52 weeks. Net interest expense should approximate $470 million. We project CapEx spending of approximately $1.2 billion for the fiscal year as we progress with building additional processing capacity for case-ready fresh chicken, beef and pork. This is a reduction of more than $100 million from our previous guidance. We may elect to slow down parts of our CapEx spending where appropriate to ensure adequate liquidity. Having said that, we expect liquidity in the back half of the year to remain well above our minimum liquidity target of $1 billion, especially after the issuance of the $1.5 billion term loan. Our capital allocation will continue to prioritize debt reduction. This includes approximately $1 billion of senior note maturities during Q3 and Q4. We did not expect to repurchase shares in the back half of the year, except for minor repurchases related to an employee stock ownership plan. We currently expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 23%. We expect to deliver profit in the back half of the year, assuming that we can continue to operate and supply our plants. Q3 has begun with higher levels of volatility. Early in the quarter, we saw huge volume falls in our retail channel. This demand partially offset declines in our foodservice channel. In recent weeks, we've seen a leveling off followed by another surge in retail demand. But as Dean has said, the volume shift from foodservice to retail is likely to be a net negative. The major challenge facing us currently is the degree to which our plants are able to operate. All plants are experiencing varying levels of crewing. We will continue to operate our plants with team member health and safety as a top priority. As you can imagine, the slowdowns and temporary closures related to the pandemic drive higher production costs, and we expect to see those until we resume under more normal conditions. Also, our COVID-19 risk mitigation activities have added costs on the broad range of safety measures we have implemented and continue to support. Despite this, we continue to focus on financial fitness and have partially offset some of these impacts. We will continue to seek out opportunities to remove unnecessary costs from our business. T sum it up, our long-term outlook remains positive. Our diversified business model allows us to react to changes created by major events like COVID-19 and African swine fever. Our balance sheet, liquidity, scale and diversified portfolio of businesses remain strong and should provide some level of protection as we move through the year. We will continue to drive the long-term growth in all parts of our business as we execute against our strategic plan with a constant focus on maximizing long-term value for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A. Yes. Look, I mean, we're not going to give you quarter by quarter. We wanted to make sure that we highlighted the back half of the year. And I think, look, when you stand back and look at Chicken for a second to say, first of all, there is a net negative in volume; second is a margin impact as a result of switching from foodservice; and third, you've got some incremental costs, which relate both to some of the onetime worker costs and also more inefficiency in the plants as we try to run them in this environment. Those last two are big numbers, and I do not think that those are with us permanent. So, first of all, we didn't say that margins will be negative. We said that chicken would likely be unprofitable in the backdrop of the year. And I think just a couple questions ago, I sort of framed that. There's a combination of factors. And the only one that I didn't point to just because it's ongoing is weaker pricing. But, if you go back and just look at those factors, the ongoing weaker pricing that we've seen, the negative impact of loss of volume, the mix shift between foodservice and retail, and then, of course, just the efficiency levels in the farm, which have been impacted by worker availability, by some of the measures that we've taken and then of course the bonuses, that sort of frames out the picture in chicken. I can't give you any more detail than that. Well, I've assumed, when you said margin, then you were thinking about gross margin. But, if you think about operating margin, then that's true. I was saying, it's going to be unprofitable at the operating income level. Yes. We're lined up."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Noel White",
            "content": "Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover today, but I want to start by saying how proud I am of our team members and the work they're doing to help feed America during this difficult time. I'll then touch briefly on our operations and results. Dean will go into further detail about our current operations and Stewart will handle the financial update from this quarter. Day in and day out in the midst of the challenges so many families are facing during this pandemic, our team members are going above and beyond to help us maintain a healthy and stable food supply to our nation and the world. From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to all of them. They're truly central to everything we're doing right now. Our number one priority is ensuring their health and safety. The only way we can operate this business is for our team members to feel safe, protected, and not fearful of coming to work. It's why we put in places a host of safeguards and guidelines at all of our facilities to protect our teams. And as we've shown in the recent days, we will not hesitate to idle any plant for deep cleaning when the need arises. Simply put, we will not send anyone into our plants to work unless we are confident that it's safe. And to do that, we have transformed how we operate. Today, if you visit our facilities, you'll see state-of-the-art health checkpoints at the entrance; and inside, you'll see team members wearing proper personal protective equipment, including face masks. You'll also see tools to help with social distancing. We've installed partitions on production lines and in break rooms. And we've stepped up our efforts to clean and sterilize everything we can. Education is important part of this effort, and we're doing our best to ensure our team members understand how they can stay safe at work and at home. Soon, team members will have on-site access to COVID-19 testing and other medical care through our new partnership with Matrix Medical Network, a leading provider of mobile health clinics. We also continue to work closely with federal, state and local health and safety authorities. Last week, as you know, the U.S. government recognized the essential work our team members do by reaffirming meat and poultry processors as a critical part of America's infrastructure. The President's executive order under the Defense Production Act establishes clear lines of authority and consistent standards that will help us continue to provide American families with the reliable supply of beef, pork and poultry. I'd now like to briefly talk about the state of our operations. Over the last several weeks, we've had to idle several facilities temporarily for deep cleaning, and others are not operating at full capacity due to worker shortages. Despite our slower lines and lower volumes resulting from this pandemic, we believe our core business and financial strength position us well to deliver market share and earnings growth over the long term. And while COVID-19 has been disruptive, we do not believe it changes the outlook for a strong future for Tyson Foods. Now, a quick summary of the quarterly results. Second quarter sales increased to a record $10.9 billion. That's an increase of more than 4% over last year. This growth was driven by volume increases of 2.6% and price increases of 1.6%. Our adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share were driven by typical seasonality, soft chicken pricing and the impacts of COVID-19. In addition, we spent -- experienced $115 million in negative derivative mark to market adjustments that Dean will discuss in further detail. Important to note that we expect to benefit from the physical offsets associated with these transactions in future periods. From a global perspective, exports to many parts of the world performed well throughout the period. During the second quarter, we saw particular strengthen in exports to Japan and Mexico with double-digit increases in our market share. Research data indicates China is reopening its economy, which is encouraging signal of domestic protein disappearance. Lower levels of supply caused by African swine fever continued to present opportunities fulfill international demand. Now, let's talk about the current operating environment. The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has had a significant impact on our channel mix with increased retail and plummeting foodservice demand. From a supply chain perspective, where possible, our facilities have adapted to new product mixes, which has enabled us to ship millions of pounds per week between channels and has set us apart from many of our competitors. Foodservice customers have also reacted with high levels of innovation and adaptation, focusing on takeout and delivery. In fact, some have only seen minimal volume loss. Supermarkets and club stores have been trying to meet heavy demand, and we've been able to convert a number of production lines from foodservice to retail to help meet those consumer needs. The direct impacts of the virus have created operational challenges, including absenteeism, reduced production speeds, and selected idling of plants. The scope of our operations continued to provide us with flexibility and redundancy. This is a clear benefit to our Company's scale. COVID-19-related pressure has affected parts of the industry supply chain, especially pork. However, our diversity of protein provides our customers with options. In addition, our geographic diversity provided important lessons from China, where we first encountered COVID-19-related issues. This includes ways to maintain health and safety of our people, opportunities to pivot to retail, potential pathways for recovery. We expect current conditions to continue during our third quarter with a gradual recovery beginning in the fourth quarter. However, all this depends on the extent to which businesses and schools are able to reopen. We're well-positioned to operate during this period and to take advantage of increasing demand during the recovery. Our balance sheet is sound and our liquidity position was strong going into the crisis. It's been further bolstered by the term loan we closed at the end of Q2 and by focusing on continuing operations and managing costs. Stewart will give you more details. We committed $13 million to support critical needs in our local communities. This includes $2 million in community grants, and more than $11 million worth of food and meals donated by the Company since March 11th. Over the coming days, we'll make product donations equal to an additional 100 million meals. Despite the immediate challenges from COVID-19 and its associated impacts, we're maintaining a clear focus on the long term. This includes our strategy to grow, deliver and sustain. Global population and income growth will continue to drive an increased need for protein. And our size, diversity of portfolio and broad geographic presence will give us an advantage. In addition, there are changes which will undoubtedly remain with us after the crisis. For example, we expect continued higher levels of ecommerce for both grocery and foodservice. Our early investments in this space have allowed us to capitalize on the growth, and we expect to benefit further in the future. Our industry is heavily dependent on people, but our companies investing aggressively in automating the most difficult jobs in our processing plants. Our balance sheet, liquidity and scale, as well as our diverse product portfolio of products and distribution channels position Tyson to benefit from long-term industry dynamics. Now, I'd like Dean to give us a recap of our business segments. Thank you, Tim. Yes. Ken, this is Noel. It's very dynamic. I would say that on the pork side of our business, we did take down our Logansport plant, we took down our Waterloo plant, Perry, which was closed for a short period of time. And each one of those plants are in the process of either coming back up or finishing the testing of all of our team members. On the beef side of our business, we took down Dakota City, which is a large facility for us, this past weekend. We're working with local county, state and federal officials to bring it back up. We took down our Pasco, Washington plant since two weeks ago, to go through the entire testing protocol. Those test results we're receiving back through the weekend. So, there's been various impacts, Ken. We will take the plant down for a period of time, and the period of time is varied, anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Does that give you a sense? Ken, it really depends on the assumptions. And our assumptions is that plants will come back up as we go through Q3 and Q4. And it's really the impacts of each one of those, the poultry plants, pork plants, beef plants. Total animals available, as you know, it's up year-over-year, 4-plus-percent. So, we're assuming that these plants, not only ours but others will, in fact, they'll go down for a period of time and then reopen. So, we are actually looking at an increase in total protein available as we go through the balance of Q3, Q4. Yes, Ben. Let me tell you, first of all, we believe it's critically important that our livestock suppliers thrive and continue to be profitable. So, we're doing everything possible to process as many animals as possible to make sure that there is a market for those animals. Longer term outlook, Ben, it's truly dependent on the closures of plants over the course of the next 60 to 90 days. There has been a backlog of inventory that's developed with both, hogs and cattle, and that will continue if plant closures continue at the pace that we're at right now. Longer term, I would say that -- on pork, it really depends on the degree of liquidation that we see over the course of the next 90 days. So, if, as an example, the weaned or baby pigs are in fact euthanized, that will have an impact sometime later this calendar year; if the sows, if the mothers are liquidated, then that has longer term implications that goes out over the course of the next 12 to 24 months. We're not seeing the same thing happen with cattle yet. A lot of the cattle are still in pasture or been on feed for a number of days. The weight is increasing, but it's not at the critical point that pork is at this point. Sure. You're accurate. That was in the prepared remarks. Based on what we see right now in the marketplace, as I mentioned on an earlier question that we are in fact expecting an increase in protein supplies through the balance of this, at least fiscal year, like the calendar year. And with that, there will likely be as there has been the last few months an oversupply of poultry in the market. Total number of animals available has not changed at this point. So, whether it's beef, pork or Chicken, we're looking at increased supply. So, most recently in the -- over the course the last couple weeks, there have been some shortages in some specific categories. However, in total, as we go into Q4, we expect supplies to be increasing and therefore not any pricing recovery. Each plant is a little different. So, it's hard to give you a precise number. I can tell you, it's significant in the millions of dollars per week in some of our larger facilities such as some of our beef and pork operations; poultry, not the same extent but still expensive; and then, we have a number of plants that we operate in our Prepared Foods space that we've not seen a big impact. And we certainly hope that that continues. So, each plant is a little bit different, depending on which plant we need to take down and how long. Well, anytime we make any comments, Heather, it is specific to Tyson. Obviously, we don't know what others in the industry are going to do. All we can do is look at industry data. So, yes, the outlook is specific to us. And, we can look at egg sets, we can -- placements. We can look a lot of different numbers, and we have no sense what others going to do. That's purely our outlook at this point in time. Cost-plus lower -- yes, it would be passed through in the cost-plus contract. Yes. Alternatively, if costs go up, price goes up; cost inputs go down, price goes down. Different plants have been impacted to different extents. I would say, Heather, so far, we have had some disruption at a couple of our facilities that we've taken them down for a relatively short period of time, days or week. And we don't know obviously, what the effect is going to be in the future. We are and will continue to work with all the local, county, states and federal officials to make sure that our team members are safe. So, at this point, we've not seen a tremendous impact on our poultry business. And obviously, we don't know what that's going to look like over the course of the next three to six months. It's just total production, we think will be up, as I mentioned earlier. Okay. Alexia, I don't have the numbers at hand by a specific poultry group. However, as Dean said in his remarks, retail is up, it's up sharply. And it depends on the week, depends on the months I think in terms of 30% to 40% up. Foodservice is recovering, I would say. And each -- within foodservice itself, each sector is down to varying degrees. So, down in rough numbers, 25% to 30% on foodservice in total, but it does vary substantially depending on the type of the foodservice establishment. I'd says, it's too early for us to do that. And like I said, it is very fluid. So, on a given day and given week, it can change substantially. So, I'm not comfortable in making any comments today. Yes. And that very well could be the case. We look at the public data just like you do. We're starting to see indications that there have been some cutbacks. We don't know what others are doing. But, given the profit structure right now, I'd say that certainly could be the case. We don't know. But, I think as you know, in poultry business, it can change much quicker than what it would be in both pork and beef. S, the things that -- the promises that you're proposing could in fact play out that way. Ken, as I mentioned, probably close to a year ago that we started investing fairly heavily in technology, automation, and that hasn't changed. We continue to invest in that segment. I do think that over the course of a time that the amount of automation will in fact, continue to increase, particularly, in some of the more difficult jobs and positions. I can tell you that, we as an example, we've invested a significant amount of money I would say in our attempt to minimize any foreign objects where we're using vision technologies to try and identify anywhere --we're working in the debone area, within poultry, we have a number of initiatives within beef and pork. So, I believe it's not only us as a company, I think the industry will continue to look for solve through automation. So, I think it will probably -- it will likely accelerate from this point. Thank you. Good morning. Assuming that the plants continue to operate, Michael... The answer would be yes. Over the course of last number of years that pork industry has been growing between 2% and 4% per year. The industry infrastructure is set up to deal with that number of hogs. So, yes, we can certainly get back to those types of numbers. No, there is nothing intended by the lack of comments there, Michael. If the plants get back up and running as we expect them to be, we would expect that the margin structure within Pork to continue at fairly healthy numbers. Year-to-date, we're just short of 11% return on sales or Q2 is a little over 7%. So, I think that it's certainly possible that we'd able to maintain those types of numbers as we look forward. Yes. I think, that's a fair assumption, Rob. I think that the slowdown in speeds and production throughput, Robert, it -- we've done everything possible to protect all of our team members, all of our employees, including social distancing. And I'd say, it's too soon to tell at this point, if in fact, that's a permanent structural change, where we would have to slow down a line to have the social distancing that's needed. So, we can't quantify specifically what that might mean going forward. We're still working through with all the -- both the state and federal officials as to what that might look like going forward. We know specifically what that means right now, Rob. But, we're a company that continuously innovates and work on better processes, and that continues to be the case. So, I don't think it's accurate to think that what we're doing today necessarily has to be the case, let's say, 12 months from now. I think we can see they're exclusive of those factors, Ben that exports year-to-date have been strong, interest continues to be strong despite very low oil prices. So, the global fundamentals that we're looking at 6 to 12 months ago haven't changed, that global protein demand still continues to grow at about a 2% rate. Production volume is not increasing at the same level. United States historically has been a low-cost supplier of protein, beef, pork and chicken to global market. So, we don't see that changing. And the demand that we've seen over the course of the last 30 to 60 days, I think this just reinforces that. And that's why we're encouraged on a long-term basis of the outlook. That hasn't changed. We have the headwinds and challenges in front of us right now that we deal with. And as long as we make sure that our team members are safe in our plants. That's priority number one. Priority number two is making sure that this Company is positioned for the long term over the course of the next 10-20-50 years to continue to be successful. So, we're not only dealing with the short term, but we also are deeply -- we're deeply -- we view the long-term on -- take it very, very seriously. Thank you. Thank you for your time today. One of the hallmarks of Tyson is turning insights into actions. The current environment presents significant opportunities for our Company as we assess and react to changes in the consumer landscape. We'll leverage our resources and infrastructure as we continue our role as a leader in food production. Let me conclude by saying, the responsibility of feeding our nation goes beyond anyone business. Working together, we're confident we can mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our communities and keep it away from our plants and help the food supply chain intact. Please stay safe. And we look forward to talk to you soon."

            "content": "Thanks, Noel, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by discussing our response to pandemic, but I'll spend a majority of my time discussing channel dynamics, current operating environment and the long-term outlook for each segment. As Noel discussed, we've experienced multiple challenges during our second quarter related to COVID-19. The response by our team members has been nothing short of heroic, and it makes me incredibly proud to be part of this great Company. I personally visited many of our impacted facilities and witnessed firsthand the steps we're taking to protect our teams. Local health departments and the CDC have also toured our facilities and have been extremely complementary of the measures we put in place to protect our team members and community. The health and safety of our team members remains our top priority. We took early decisive action to provide workspace distancing, PPE and other protective measures. We've had no layoffs or furloughs, and have extended $120 million of bonuses and improved benefits to our frontline team members. This will also allow us to quickly recover once we move past the effects of COVID-19. Now, let's discuss some channel dynamics we've observed in the wake of COVID-19. Each of our businesses has witnessed a profound shift from foodservice to retail. Our retail business remains strong and our core retail lines posted gains of more than 20% in the last 13 weeks, outpacing total food and beverage, as well as the top 10 food manufacturers. While panic buying has subsided from extreme levels, we continue to see 15% to 40% volume increases versus last year, depending on the category. As a result of these trends, we have successfully increased volume, margin and share within retail. Historically, approximately 45% of our total Company sales were the retail, 40% foodservice and 15% international. During early Q3, we saw our retail sales move to approximately two-thirds of our total Company sales. While we were successful in shifting some of our production from foodservice to retail, not all of our facilities are able to do so. The volume increases in retail have not been sufficient to offset the losses in foodservice. And as a result, we expect negative year-over-year volumes in the second half of fiscal 2020. Operationally, we have faced two meaningful challenges, slowdown, resulting from team member shortages or choices we made to ensure operational safety and temporary closures related to COVID-19 infection. We've continued to pay team members during the slowdowns and closure since maintaining health and continued employment of our team members is important for our longer term success. As a result, we've experienced lower levels of productivity and higher cost of production. This will likely continue in the short term until local infection rates begin to decrease. Within the ecommerce channel, we witnessed significant sales growth including a more than 140% month-to-month growth rate in our core business lines sold to a major ecommerce customer. We expect this trend to continue. Going forward, we expect sustained retail sales growth and a slow recovery in our foodservice channel. Now, let's take a look at our segments. During the second quarter, our Prepared Foods segment produced an operating margin of 9.2%. Top-line growth continued with the seventh straight quarter volume and dollar share growth. Sales were up 2.6% for the quarter, and pricing was up 2.7%. Within the last 13 weeks, total volume, sales, household penetration and share increased across the core business lines. Historically, 60% of our Prepared Foods sales have been to the retail channel and 40% to foodservice. During Q3, we've seen greater than 20% growth in our retail sales. This channel, driven by our strong brands and innovation capabilities provides a highest growth potential and margin opportunity across our portfolio. In the current environment, our retail-centric products continue to show strength, while the current reduction in raw material availability may cause short- term outages. Our ability to flex our production footprint between the foodservice and retail channels is limited. Consequently, we currently believe the full effect of these new consumption patterns will result in a net reduction in volume. Looking forward, our market insight, channel flexibility, access to raw material and growing demand give us long-term optimism. We are responding to the changes in consumer demand by pivoting our branded investments and innovation to more value-oriented offerings and two formats and sizes relevant for rapidly evolving channel dynamics such as e-commerce acceleration. Our retail businesses and brands are well-positioned to deliver sustained growth even if we enter into a recessionary environment. Our Beef segment produced an operating margin of 2.7% in the second quarter. Commodity volatility during the quarter resulted in a negative impact of $55 million in derivative mark-to-market adjustments. As Noel mentioned, it's important to note, this amount does not include physical assets, which may be recognized in future periods. Our beef business has done an excellent job of pivoting from foodservice to retail and continuing to drive innovation. We found new retail applications for products that have traditionally supplied the foodservice channel, which we believe could generate continued demand even in the post COVID-19 environment. These exports remain strong, posting double digit increases compared to the same quarter last year, which have exceeded industry growth rates. Export markets are an important outlet for us now and in the future. In the current environment, we see strong demand and ample supply of cattle, but reduced industry processing capacity due to COVID-19 has pressured the supply chain and has reduced overall profitability. Temporary plant closings dramatically increased operating costs and weakened what would otherwise be a strong margin environment. As a result of the shutdown, cattle producers are met with much lower processing demand for their fed cattle. We recognize how this impacts our producer community and are anxious to safely resume operations at our facilities to provide them with an outlet for their cattle. Looking forward, we expect clinical supplies of cattle coupled with strong demand for beef both domestically and via export, our relationships with producers, industry-leading production capabilities, and customer-centric solutions gives us confidence in the long-term outlook for this business. Moving to our Pork segment, strong demand solid operational execution and ample hog supplies led to a 7.3% operating margin in Q2. As we transition to a ractopamine-free hog supply, our ability to sell pork to the global markets has expanded. This new capability has been met with increasing global demand as African swine fever continues to reduce pork supplies in Asia. Year-over-year increases of pork to China were up significantly for the quarter, and we expect strong demand to continue as China recovers from this COVID-19 lockdown. In the current environment, we see strong demand and ample supply of hogs, but reduced industry processing capacity of nearly 50% to the COVID-19 has pressured the supply chain and dramatically reduced overall profitability. As pork plants across the country have continued to shut down, hog producers are met with much lower processor demand for their market-ready hogs. We recognize how this impacts our producer community and are anxious to safely resume operations at our facilities to provide them with an outlet for their hogs. Looking ahead, we see large supplies of livestock and strong demand driven by a global shortage of pork. We continue to believe the impact of African swine fever in Asia could generate significant future margin potential. Our Chicken segment produced an operating margin of 2.9% in the second quarter. Operating income was negatively affected by a $40 million increase in net feed ingredient reading costs and negative derivative mark to market adjustments. This along with weaker pricing from increased domestic availability of chicken has offset the benefits of our operational improvement initiatives. Weaker pricing dynamics have persisted into the third quarter. Our Chicken segment has higher foodservice exposure than Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. We responded to demand shifts caused by COVID-19 by adjusting parts of our production capacity from foodservice to retail, but higher retail volumes have not entirely offset the lost volumes from foodservice. Additionally, this channel shift has resulted in lower margin realization as volumes have moved to lower margin products. Also, worker shortages have reduced overall plant efficiency resulting in higher production costs. Due to large domestic supplies coupled with reduced foodservice consumption, we believe our chicken operations are likely to incur losses in the back half of the year. Profit trends will improve as foodservice activity recovers. Turning to our international business. Our China operations were impacted by COVID-19 more than any other region during the second quarter. Despite this, our China team produced record sales and operating income as production was shifted to meet rising retail demand. While China is recovering, other geographies where we produce or sell are being impacted negatively by COVID-19, especially since our international business has historically had a high level of exposure to the foodservice channel. We expect to see a slow recovery across each of our geographies as demand patterns normalize. The profitability will be impacted negatively in the short term. In closing, our businesses across the enterprise are adapting to the dramatic changes brought about by COVID-19 and the response of our team has provided consumers continued access to a safe and affordable food supply. Short-term challenges do not diminish our belief in the Company's long-term outlook. Our unique business model, diverse portfolio and industry-leading scale will make us stronger and more resilient. Before I hand over to Stewart to take us through the financials, I'd like to thank our 141,000 team members who continue to support our mission of feeding the world. Their health and safety are critical to that mission. Over to you, Stewart. Sure, Ken. First thing I want to say -- and I'm sure you know this, team member safety remains our top priority. And we're sparing no expense to keep them safe. We are fully complying and been interacting with the government authorities, including the USDA, the CDC, OSHA, and even county and local governments. And we've had intermittent outages from time to time as it's been necessary to make sure that our team members are kept absolutely safe. The expenses related to these closures, I'll start with PPE. We've invested substantially in our protective equipment for our team members, including things like chartering planes to supply masks even before they were mandated by the CDC. We bought some quite expensive thermal scanners to make sure that we can check temperatures for our team members coming in and out of our plants. And other expenses if the inefficiency of the plants driven by the slowing or idling the plants while they're being checked and while our team members are being tested. Another priority of ours is to keep food on the table of our consumers. And so, that includes running and recovering plants at slower capacities, which from time being but also running them with overtime and additional costs to make sure that whenever we can run them in control, we can put food on the American tables. One expense I can quantify for you is the $120 million in Thank You bonuses we provided to our team members during this time for the hard work. And again, team member safety being our top priority, it is hard to predict the extent of these costs over time. Ken, I would just add that mix plays a really strong role in this. As you probably know, a substantial portion of our business has been in foodservice, which is down. And our retail business is up. But as we mentioned in the call, those do not perfectly counterbalance. And so, that will also have an impact on our long term blended sale price. Sure. Our retail customers have been phenomenally supportive. And we continue to work with them as we always would, and we're not planning to take price increase there. As it relates to foodservice specifically, we have seen some of our customers really get decimated due to the COVID crisis and closure of restaurants, limited supply in deli and that sort of thing. We have seen some of our customers, specifically QSRs recover very well. Their model of having takeout food and drive-thrus, have really allowed them to be resilient and continue to thrive in the market. So, I'll just mention a few things here is that as this disease has progressed, as we've learned more, anything that we can find or discover that can improve safety in our facilities, we are doing. And when it comes to the long-term structural cost of the business, there are some things that we're installing now. For example, these thermal scanners that will -- we will leave installed and they'll provide even benefit whenever we move into the next flu season to just help our team members better understand, they're starting to develop sickness early and that sort of thing. But no, it's not possible to really quantify or put a number on what those costs are going to look like related to COVID-19. I think, it's difficult to describe in a lot of ways, because some of our plants have expenses -- scaled equipment for things like producing ground beef and sausage and that sort of thing. We do have some robotic automation and things like palletizing and that sort of thing. The thing that I would stress is that automation provides really a lot of things, but one of the things that I would stress is flexibility where we had installed some Multivac vacuum packaging systems for products like beef and pork. What we've seen is that those businesses' ability to very quickly shift those products from retail or from foodservice to retail, which has been really beneficial to those businesses. But, it's difficult to really put a percentage on automation across each of the business units. If you take a look at our segment data in the Q, you get some sense of what are his historic numbers have looked like by channel. So, that doesn't give it to you by segment, but it'll give you a good sense of what the various volumes are on exposure to foodservice. If you apply some of the percentages that Noel has suggested to that, I think it'll give you -- it'll give you a sense. But, bear in mind that when you look at that, one of those channels is industrial, and part of that is going to be foodservice. So, we sell on to somebody else that then processes for foodservice. But, I think that's the best place to look. Hi. This is Dean. We're not going to be able to comment on a customer by customer basis. What we're hoping for is a relatively U-shaped curve, long U-shaped curve coming out of this crisis, which will be really beneficial to the small business owner restaurants and distributors. We'd love to see their business really start to recover in the coming quarters, especially as states start to open up. As it relates to who is faring best. As I said before, our QSR customers are really those that are outperforming, because of the flexibility of their model in both historical abilities, either delivered through click and collect, takeout, drive-thru, et cetera. Hi. This is Dean. I'll stress -- your first point is really -- cannot be understated. So, -- it cannot be overstated. The uniformity with which our plants are governed, really being dictated by the experts, the CDC, the OSHA, USDA, is critical for us to both maintain industry standards high. We've actually had a few of our plants visited by folks like state government health officials and CDC. And they've actually asked to work with not only food industries coming back on line, but also other industries to show them how we've taken care of our team members. The second point about PPE, we moved very, very quickly, early in the process to secure PPE for our team members. But those go quickly in our business. And so, the other benefit of the executive order is really to make sure that we have long-term abundant supplies depending on how long this pandemic ultimately lasts, things like masks, hairnets et cetera. We've gone so far and sometimes just gave out masks to team members so that they can operate in their community where they know that there may be some latent disease, so that they can operate safely in the community and not bring that back into the plant. So, those are really the two main benefits of the order."

Along with Stewart, joining us in the room today is Dean Banks who joined the company at the beginning of the month and is beginning to transition to his new role as President of our company. Welcome Dean. We're pleased to report we delivered top and bottom-line growth in our first quarter and generated record Beef results. Before I speak to these results, I'd like to talk about our focus on sustainability to meet the growing global demand for protein that's why we recently announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos the creation of the Coalition for Global Protein. A combination of strategies and solutions including all forms of protein are needed to responsibly feed a world population expected to reach almost 10 billion in 2050 requiring an estimated doubling of the production of protein needed today. Our goal is to unite stakeholders across the food and agricultural sector to develop new and creative solutions to sustainably feed the world with affordable nutritious food. We believe this reflects positively on our strategy which is focused on sustaining our company and our world for future generations, while growing our business by delivering superior value to consumers and customers and fueling our growth and returns through commercial, operational, and financial excellence. Turning to our results, our overall first quarter was in line with expectations with adjusted earnings of $1.66 per share. Beef and Pork results were strong. Prepared Foods drove growth in retail consumption. The Chicken improved operationally, although continued to face soft pricing which weighed on results. Looking across the marketplace, consumption of our retail Prepared Food products has been outstanding. Both the Tyson core retail business lines which were up more than 5% and total Tyson retail up more than 3% outpaced volume and sales growth versus the top 10 retail food manufacturers in the 52 weeks ending December 28th. This growth contrasts with the total food and beverage category which was down 0.4% for the same period. We've now experienced six consecutive quarters of growth. Our core business lines are outpacing the categories with volume share growth of 1% and all core business lines are holding or growing share. In the Foodservice channel, our Foodservice Focus six product lines grew 3.5% and were twice the total broadline distribution channel growth of 1.6% over the last 13 weeks. The power of our Foodservice brands, innovation, and capabilities across all channels has set the stage for growth. In the last three months, Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage volume grew 10%; Tyson Red Label grew 17%; and the Tyson brand grew 8%. Now, let's take a look at our business segments. In Prepared Foods, growth and share performance has been outstanding, especially with our big brands. Retail innovation launched at the end of fiscal 2019 is performing well with velocities meeting or exceeding targets on the national launches of Jimmy Dean Biscuit Roll-Ups and Jimmy Dean Morning Combos with both demonstrating velocity performance in the top half of their respective categories. While still early, Biscuit Roll-Ups show potential for driving category growth. Prepared Foods profit margin in the first quarter was impacted by an $80 million increase in raw material costs driven by beef trim and hams. Some of this increase was offset by pricing though Prepared Foods may continue to experience volatile input costs. We continue to experience some operational effects from our recent ERP system implementation which impacted margins by roughly $40 million in the quarter. About half of this was discounted sales with the remainder related to inventory write-downs and donations. Although, the effects have persisted longer than anticipated, we continue to work aggressively to resolve them and we are seeing progress. In the alternative protein category, the Raised & Rooted brand is only the beginning of our plan to build the world's leading portfolio of plant protein products. In the back half of the year, we're planning multiple new launches across protein forms, brands, meal occasions and channels. Over time, we see these options as another stable protein complementing our core offerings. We're being practical and thoughtful in our approach to enable us to create better product experiences with healthier nutritious ingredients at affordable prices. Looking ahead for the Prepared Foods segment, we expect to maintain our momentum in the market. We will do this by continued investment behind our brands through marketing, promotions and innovation. And we will remain agile with pricing to offset input costs driven by the volatility of raw materials. For the fiscal year, we believe the Prepared Foods segment's adjusted operating margin will be 10% to 12%. Our Beef segment produced a record adjusted operating margin of 11.2% in the first quarter. The quality of domestic-fed cattle has been excellent. This makes every link of the beef supply chain more valuable, whether it's a producer, the packer or the retailer and results in a better product for consumers. Our premium programs continue to grow as a percentage of sales. Our customers and consumers are seeing the value in our quality and it's translating into increased revenue. Our Fresh Meats premium programs have nearly doubled over the last five years to approximately \u00a31 billion. I'm pleased to report that our Finney County, Kansas plant damaged by fire last August is now back to full operations. Beef exports are strong with the potential to be even stronger now that trade agreements have been formalized. I'd like to remind you however that our second quarter is typically our most challenging for Beef. In addition to the challenges caused by winter weather in the Midwest, the drought in Australia has forced a herd liquidation putting more beef on the global market. Looking ahead, exports from Australia are expected to decline substantially as the ongoing drought and the tragic fires are likely to delay their herd rebuilding. With Australian beef amounting to quarter of U.S. beef imports, this could be beneficial to our business. Our export sales continue to equal or exceed industry growth rates. For fiscal 2020, we're expecting our Beef segment's adjusted operating margin to meet the upper end of 6.5% to 7.5%. Moving to our Pork segment. Strong pork demand and solid operational execution along with ample hog supplies led to a 14% adjusted operating margin in Q1. Export markets were the primary driver for increased demand. We believe that we are at the very early stages of the global demand shifts that we've expected from African swine fever. We're filling additional orders to China and we've seen year-over-year increases nearly 600% in the first quarter and we're already benefiting from indirect shipments as we backfill in other markets. We've progressed towards a ractopamine-free hog supply. This will open up more markets to us as the need to move product globally increases. In fact, global demand for all proteins is increasing as ASF continues to reduce pork supplies in Asia. For fiscal 2020, we're expecting our Pork segment's adjusted operating margin to be 6% to 8%. Now turning to the Chicken segment. We're pleased that our execution is better and operations are on track to deliver $200 million year-over-year run rate improvement. However, pricing which has been weaker than expected was the primary driver of our return on sales in Q1, but softer pricing has persisted into the second quarter. All leading indicators point to domestic poultry supply growth and the USDA is projecting a 4% increase in chicken production. I previously indicated global protein suppliers being impacted by ASF, while demand continues to grow at about 2% per year. In light of ASF, we anticipate global demand will keep pace with U.S. supply growth as Chinese imports of U.S. chicken are expected to double. Domestically, we'll continue to innovate and drive demand in the frozen value-added space with products like Tyson Air Fried Chicken. This product launched last July with strong customer acceptance and is demonstrating dollar velocity performance in the top half of the category. Early data shows that the Tyson Air Fried Chicken is attracting new consumers and driving growth in this $2.6 billion category. Looking ahead in the Chicken segment, we expect an annual adjusted operating margin of 4% to 6% driven primarily by softer pricing and overall chicken supply. In International and Other, both our legacy and newly acquired businesses are contributing to our improved international performance. We see the potential to expand in these growth markets, which are estimated to drive 98% of global protein demand increases over the next five years with 70% of that growth coming from Asia. We have a business of scale and there are still synergies to unlock. We have high-quality assets and a strong team led by Chris Langholz who recently joined the company as President of International. Chris has an extensive background in global protein and we welcome him to the Tyson team. Our legacy International business are performing well increasing sales and earnings. The new acquisitions are providing great platforms for growth. We're committed to becoming the global leader in protein by serving emerging markets and strategic customers across channels and across segments. Across our businesses, trade deals are contributing to our optimism. We believe with improved access to global markets from recent trade deals, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the global marketplace. In addition to U.S. trade deals with Japan and South Korea, we're very pleased the Phase one trade agreement with China and the USMCA have both been signed. An important benefit of the deal with China is the inclusion of more protein eligible for shipment. We're shipping product to China and have more orders on the books. But keep in mind that tariffs that remain in place puts the U.S. at a pricing disadvantage in the Chinese market. If tariffs are lifted or reduced, we would likely see an acceleration of already increased global demand for U.S. pork, beef and chicken. We're closely monitoring news of the coronavirus. We're actively assessing what this outbreak may mean for us for our global business and preparing for the possibility of any impact. In China, we've been working with the government and have successfully restarted some of our operations. The financial impact is unknown at this time. With that I'll now ask Stewart to take us through the financials.\nStewart Glendinning: Thanks Noel and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results were inline with our expectations with earnings of $1.66 per share, up 5% from Q1, 2019. Operating income was $894 million, up 6% over last year. First quarter GAAP operating income was impacted $52 million or $0.11 per share for a restructuring charge and $16 million net of insurance proceeds or $0.03 per share for costs related to a fire at our beef plant in Finney County, Kansas. Sales in Q1 were up 6% to just over $10.8 billion with an 8.3% return on sales. Sales volume was up 4.7% and average sales price was up 1.4%. Our operating cash flows were $894 million for the quarter and liquidity was $1.4 billion at quarter end. Including cash of $497 million net debt was $11.2 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.7 times for the 12-month ending December 28. Net interest expense was $117 million in Q1. Capital expenditures were $312 million in the quarter and we continue to target an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital. Our capital allocation will continue to prioritize debt reduction while reinvesting in our business for organic growth buying back stock and increasing our dividend. In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $132 million. Weighted average shares outstanding were approximately $367 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 22.7% in the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization was $288 million. As Noel said, our newly acquired international businesses are contributing to the improvement in our International operations. Their contributions are inline with or better than our expectations, despite the high amortization and purchase price accounting loads placed on them. Noel has articulated our segment return on sales guidance which should give you an indication of how we expect our businesses to perform. Now I'd like to provide some additional commentary on our outlook. Keep in mind that fiscal 2020 is a 53-week year. However we have adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks. Net interest expense should approximate $450 million. We continue to project approximately $1.3 billion in CapEx for the fiscal year, as we progress with building additional processing capacity for case-ready fresh chicken, beef and pork and we plan to scale back CapEx when those projects are completed. We expect liquidity to remain above our $1 billion target. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%. I would like to remind you that Q2 is normally a weaker quarter for us and we have seen a slower than expected start in January. For Q2 fiscal year 2020, we are expecting lower earnings than Q1 driven by continued weak market conditions in chicken, higher raw material costs and some residual ERP impacts in Prepared Foods and normal seasonal cyclicality in beef and pork. When combined with the overall availability of protein a continuation of these factors will likely result in our earnings being lower than the same quarter last year. This is before any potential impacts to our business from coronavirus. Improvements in the back half are dependent upon achieving expected savings and pricing improvements in Chicken, managing to offset raw material cost increases in Prepared Foods and continued strong demand for beef and pork later in the year. That concludes my remarks and now we'll go back to Noel for additional commentary. Noel?\nNoel White: Thank you, Stewart. Supply-demand dynamics have become much more global and our diversified business model and global footprint put us where the growth is occurring and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. In addition, we're encouraged by potential increased, export demand and the resulting reduced domestic availability of proteins. In closing, our strong brands, strong team, world-class assets, great customers and a global footprint to meet growing demand for protein leave us well positioned for future success. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we're ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nNoel White: Good morning, Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Hi. I'm sure others will be focusing on the Chicken dynamics, but just to kick things off at a higher level, can you give us an update on where things stand with the trade agreements particularly with China? What's going on with the tariff situation? And what are you seeing in terms of international shipments? Because I know that it's -- there's things opening up around the world for you. How do you expect that to evolve over time?\nNoel White: Yeah. Actually we are very pleased that our government has come to trade agreements just since our last conference call with Japan and Korea, Phase one agreement with China with USMCA. So we're very pleased with the progress that our government has made. Shipments continue and interest has been strong. We are currently shipping and we have more orders on the books for China. And our business in the other countries that I mentioned continue to be strong as well not only those countries, but other countries around the world. So from a trade perspective, it looks very promising. And as you might have seen overnight some of the tariffs that have been in place with China were lowered by approximately 5%. So that's great progress as well.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And as a follow-up we have seen the pork cutout price start to increase over here as we would expect. We haven't seen much movement in terms of the grocery on-shelf pricing, which ultimately could start to drive the overall meat on the below part. Do you anticipate that those retail prices will start to increase on the Pork side and then start to bleed out into the other parts of the business as well?\nNoel White: Alexia, first of all, I think pork continues to be a great value in the marketplace. And whether it's beef or chicken, chicken is also very attractively priced and whether there's room to raise prices on pork I think it really depends on what happens to cutout over the course of the next 60 days or so. I don't think retailers are going to immediately going to change prices because of some short-term increases in wholesale prices. I think that if they believe that that will continue to be the case then they will. I think it's too soon to call.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nNoel White: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ken Zaslow with the Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.\nKen Zaslow: Hey, good morning everyone.\nNoel White: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Zaslow: Just have two questions. One is can you talk about your chicken operations outlook? The industry is clearly going -- is kind of soft, but can you parse out the difference between what happened Tyson internally issues and underlying fundamentals for the chicken industry? And where is that going to go? Again, the quarter is done second quarter is largely kind of in the books as well. But can you talk about where the outlook will go and how you kind of think about that?\nNoel White: Sure Ken. First of all, our chicken operations, if you remember last quarter I said that we expected a $200 million improvement year-over-year in 2020 versus 2019 purely from a performance standpoint. And I am pleased to say that we are on track for the run rate of capturing that $200 million. So our plants continue to perform better than what they were. However, the pricing environment on poultry has been relatively weak and that's obvious in public available data, so the improvements that we've captured purely from a performance standpoint has been either offset or more than offset by the weakness in wholesale pricing.\nKen Zaslow: So you think it's mostly the industry not your operations that has created a downside to your guidance?\nNoel White: Absolutely. Yes.\nKen Zaslow: Then my second question is just building on Alexia's question is, when you're thinking about the exports, can you tell me what you think the exports will increase for chicken beef and pork in 2020 and more importantly 2021? Are we looking at double-digit increases across the board? Are we looking at 20%? Like how do you think about this in terms of how the export picture will build over the next -- for each of the proteins?\nNoel White: Ken, I can't give you an exact number as to what the expectation of the increase is going to be. I think it will certainly increase. And if we take back through 2019, there was a run-up in hog prices in the spring and exports didn't material quite as quickly as what was expected. There were heavy shipments coming out of both South America and Europe to China. And then the Chinese stepped into the U.S. market and we saw the effect of that in the fall. And a lot of the product arrived and cleared in time for the Chinese New Year. There's product that continues to ship. There continues to be interest in pork and the same thing would be true with beef and with poultry. So interest has been strong. Demand has been good. And the other thing I mentioned on the call last quarter is that we expected to backfill into other markets. And that in fact has happened. Our shipments to some of the other countries have in fact increased. So it's not just China, it's to other countries around the world as well.\nKen Zaslow: Thank you.\nNoel White: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRob Moskow: Hi. Thank you. I had some questions about the chicken guidance. You lowered the margin estimate by about 200 basis points. But also in your prepared remarks, Noel, you said that you're now including the assumption that global demand will match the supply growth, which has also been increased to 4%. I think in your prior guidance you said, you were not going to include any ASF impact on the chicken business or on the business as a whole. Are we now assuming that there's an ASF, a positive ASF impact in the back half of your year? And then I had a follow-up.\nNoel White: Yes. We do think that there will be a positive impact Rob on exports. We are expecting the four production -- 4% production increase. We are expecting to continue to see growth in demand from an export standpoint not only to China but to other places in the world as well.\nRob Moskow: Okay. But it's just not enough to drive your overall chicken pricing higher to offset the excess supply here in the U.S.?\nNoel White: Yes. And Rob I think we need to keep in mind that when we talk about exports into the different markets that there's strength in certain products, there's weaknesses in certain products when we talk about chicken. So the USDA data would indicate that chicken breast pricing in particular has been weak. On the other hand there has been strength in other products such as boneless skinless thighs and tenders and wings. So it's not as simple as just thinking chicken, but it's specific parts that there's strength and weaknesses.\nRob Moskow: Sure. And here's the follow-up. The -- I've talked to industry participants about what's causing the excess supply. It looks like some of it is transitory related to favorable weather and grow-outs. Can you give us a sense as to whether you think this 4% U.S. supply growth sustains for another year for another two years? I mean, I can make the case that there's a lot of capacity coming online, so maybe 4% is the new number. But I could also see the argument that maybe we're coming to the end of a multiyear expansion in the industry.\nNoel White: Right. Rob, I -- first of all there was very favorable weather conditions as we came through fall for growing conditions. I think the weight of the chicken as an industry was up year-over-year. I know that ours was certainly heavier, heavier than what we originally projected and I just have to assume that that's probably the case with others in the industry as well. Historically, the U.S. increase over the course of time has averaged at about a 2% growth rate and that's a pretty well-kept pace with what the increase in demand has been. So over the course of 12 months it's hard for me to say, but I think over the course of time that we think in terms of about 2% that that's kind of where my mindset would be.\nRob Moskow: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nNoel White: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead.\nHeather Jones: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nNoel White: Good morning.\nHeather Jones: Good morning. So I want to stick with chicken and just dive a little deeper. You mentioned that you're on pace to generate the $200 million in operational improvements. And like you said, breast meat pricing has been weak. Now if we rewind a few years ago, Tyson was always well pretty consistently short breast meat but it seems like -- because the year-on-year deterioration in Tyson's chicken performance for this quarter was worse than the industry. So am I right in thinking that you guys are long more breast meat than you've been in the last couple of years? And if so is there any expectation that that should shift in coming quarters?\nNoel White: Good question Heather. When Rob asked the question about production increases and I mentioned that the weights were heavier than expected that is in fact true with us and breast meat production as well. So we did use more internally. We did not buy as much on the outside market as what we had originally projected or planned to. Corrections have been made Heather that our buy versus grow strategy remains intact. However in Q1, it was not exactly as we planned.\nHeather Jones: Okay. Thank you for that. And my follow-up is as far as -- how should we think about -- I mean pork exports to China have been pretty strong consistently and I would expect those to accelerate. But on the poultry side, just wondering if you could give us a sense of how you expect the cadence of those exports to be. The coronavirus seems to slow down the logistics some, but do you expect this to build as that February 14th agreement takes place? Or I mean, how should we -- how are you guys thinking about the cadence and exports to China of poultry specifically?\nNoel White: Heather every day brings something new. The news overnight was welcome. If anything I'd say that we're going to have quite a bit of volatility. As I mentioned demand continues to be -- or interest at least continues to be strong. There is certainly the need and coronavirus has just clouded that a bit frankly Heather. There has been disruptions. There's been disruptions in domestic production. There's been disruption at the ports. So that has skewed shipments receivables. I would expect that we get -- once we get past the coronavirus incident whenever that might be that, I do think that there's going to be a very strong demand coming out of that. But trying to estimate what that time period is going to be is not possible at this point.\nHeather Jones: Okay. Thank you so much.\nNoel White: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Yeah. Good morning, Noel, Stewart. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess, we've talked a lot about Chicken so I want to switch a little bit into Pork and Beef. So, clearly on Pork to start-off, I mean you've had a very strong first quarter 14% operating income margin, but nonetheless you kept the guidance unchanged at 6% to 8%. So, I mean simple arithmetic it looks like you're looking for a relative weakness on a sequential basis for the remainder of the year. And it's also curious because you've said on an earlier question that you now do take a little bit of ASF benefit into the back half of the Chicken segment so you're not taking anything into consideration for Pork, or is it just trying to be conservative, if you could give a little more clarity on the guidance in Pork.\nNoel White: Sure. Ben, our Q1 October, November, December is typically the strongest margin quarter for us and it's not unusual for us to drop off in Q2. So we're basically following the typical seasonal patterns that we would see. And normally we'll see things start to improve in Q2. And then through the summer it's not bad. And then in Q1, October, November, December it strengthens pretty substantially. So we're just projecting that the basic seasonal patterns that we've seen in the past.\nBen Theurer: And that is literally absent any ASF benefit though?\nNoel White: In this case yes.\nBen Theurer: Okay. And then on Beef. I mean, clearly you've highlighted it within the release that you still had obviously the operational headwind but just not being able to get enough volume through because of the closing of the Kansas plant and the fire that affected it. Now you're back in. Could you elaborate a little bit? Like, if things would have been normal how would Beef turned out? So if you \u2013 I mean, you've adjusted for it to a certain degree but how would your volume at the other Beef plants during the quarter where you printed the minus 8% if we take out the one that was shut down because of the fire? Just to see the underlying fundamentals on Beef.\nNoel White: Yeah. Ben, that's impossible to say what volumes would have been without the fire. I think the distinction was basically that the strength in our export demand and I think it's more of a demand story than restricted supply story. So don't know what supply would have been without the fire, but I do know that demand has been extraordinarily strong both domestically and from an export standpoint in Beef.\nBen Theurer: Okay. Perfect. I'll leave it here. Thank you very much.\nNoel White: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nNoel White: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: So I was hoping to just dig a little bit more on the Chicken business and really just make sure \u2013 just thinking about the different market segments there and the pricing and market pressure that you're facing. I mean, again, I think just going back to Heather's question on the buy versus grow and breast meat seems to be bearing a disproportionate amount of some of the market pressures of late. And just trying to think about how that's translating to \u2013 into your \u2013 whether it's the tray pack the small bird your further process business I wouldn't think that that impact is equal. I mean, especially where \u2013 I would think leg quarters you should have some benefit from better pricing. And as we think about 2020, just any comments on contracting for various foodservice institutional accounts how that \u2013 how those played out?\nNoel White: Yeah. Adam, first of all I can't talk about pricing. It's a very sensitive subject. Most of the pricing is concluded not all of it, but most of it. And I would say that, as we came through our Q1 and as we enter Q2 breast meat pricing in particular is weaker than I would have expected it to be. However, as I mentioned earlier there has been strength in other products. Leg quarter pricing frankly has been a bit erratic as we came through Q1 January, February and don't know at this point what March, April, May is going to hold. A lot of those prices are not yet settled so that would be purely speculate on my behalf. However, with breast meat USDA's data would say it's trading something below $1 right now so it's at or near historic lows. It presents a tremendous value both at retail and at foodservice. And typically when that happens you see some type of increase in either featuring or promotions at foodservice establishments. So I think that over the course of time and whether that's one month or six months, we're going to see increased promotion on those proteins that are of greatest value. And right now that would include chicken breast.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. And then just shifting gears a bit of a clarification question but maybe there's something in here. Just in the quarter in Prepared Foods your reported volume was down 3.1% yet you look at whether \u2013 the scan Nielsen data that we could track and what you reported on the slides in terms of the growth, both for retail and focus five foodservice items, there's growth. And I'm just trying to understand, kind of, the disparity between the reported segment growth on the volume side versus what you can see in the measured channels.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. I think, when you look at the -- this is Stewart. When you look at the reported volumes, those volumes reflect some channel shifts that we had between our segments. They don't account really for any profit on a total basis, so pretty immaterial. You see them in the quarter because of the kind of product. But the numbers we are giving you, in terms of the performance in the market, are more of the organic numbers that reflect the momentum of the business.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nNoel White: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: I wanted to ask about SAP. You had said that -- I appreciate the color on the call-out to the impact to Prepared Foods in the quarter. Obviously, you guys are making strides on improving the margins net raw material cost and net of SAP cost challenges. And the guidance for the balance of the year suggests that, that should continue margin expansion. So I'm just curious, if you could provide any color on how you expect the cadence of SAP impact to linger if at all. Should we see the magnitude diminish? And is it impacting any of the other segments beyond Prepared Foods?\nStewart Glendinning: Well, just to be clear, this was a system that was implemented for both Chicken and Prepared. We see the impact only in Prepared at the moment. We don't want to give any specific guidance on the timing for that. Know that we're working aggressively. We are managing the factors that influence the write-offs and the distressed inventory that we see. And we of course expect to see improvement as we move forward.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Great. And then, one question from me, on the Chicken segment. You talked about, Noel, making some corrections to being a bit longer on boneless skinless breast. Is that -- can you help us think about what those adjustments are, how quickly you can make them? And if this is a sensitive question, I understand. But, I think, on the facility front you guys have looking -- have been looking at opening the Humboldt facility later this year. Does the current supply environment impact that decision or the timing of that at all, to the extent you can comment?\nNoel White: You're right, Ben, that is a sensitive question. Now, the production in our Q1, it was heavier than it was originally projected. And we, as always, respond to things that we don't expect, so you can fully expect that to take place. And as far as timing of the Humboldt start-up, nothing has changed with that. The project is on schedule and on budget.\nStewart Glendinning: And one other thing -- sorry, Noel, if I can just go back to the previous question. I just want to make sure that I'm very clear. Ben, your question on, when we expect to see improvement, we have so far this quarter have seen run rates that have been consistent with last quarter. And just for clarity, as we're working on this, of course, we expect this not to be a permanent part of our business. I want to be really clear that, that improvement lies in front of us.\nBen Bienvenu: Very, very helpful. Thanks and best of luck.\nStewart Glendinning: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Piken: Thank you. And just wanted to touch base a little bit on some of the chicken sandwich wars, and basically, it seems like there's been a lot of talk about the success of those sandwich wars. And just wondering, like, is the dynamic within the chicken markets healthier, maybe, for like some of the smaller birds and maybe the tray pack? Or is there a spillover effect from the weakness, maybe, in some of the bigger bird breast meat markets? And can these sandwich wars maybe help the chicken market? How much?\nNoel White: Michael, with fast food, different customers use different-sized birds, so it's not possible to say that's advantaging one segment versus another. If we go back a couple of years ago, we saw hamburgers being heavily promoted. And, obviously, this last year that switched to chicken burgers and -- or chicken sandwiches and it looks like this year that we're going to see the same thing. And that's purely because of the value that chicken has right now. And ground pork and beef prices are higher. The lean beef, particularly lean imported beef, is up substantially due to the reasons I talked about in the script, with drought conditions and the shortage of supply coming on, on the imported side.\nMichael Piken: Okay, yes. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up here. I think one particularly large operator that you guys had serviced pretty heavily, is talking about potentially doing a pretty big promotion for chicken later this year. Like, is it possible, or what steps to take place, like, if there's not enough of like the smaller birds, like, can you guys chop up some of the bigger breast meat or the -- from the heavier birds to accommodate that product? Or how easy is it to do it? What steps does that entail? Thank you.\nNoel White: Well, okay. Michael first of all I cannot talk about what specific customers may or may not be doing. But I think that there will be sufficient supply, regardless on whatever customer that you might be referring to. So I don't see an issue from a supply standpoint but can't talk specifically about any specific customer.\nMichael Piken: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTom Palmer: Good morning. It's Tom Palmer on for Ken. Thanks for the question. I first wanted to clarify the Chicken guidance. Company is guiding to 4% to 6% EBIT margin, absent additional impacts from ASF. The prepared remarks and a lot of the answers today seem to focus on when pricing should get better this year from increased ASF-driven exports. So just given the first quarter results, which sounds like it's a slow start to the second quarter, what are the non-ASF drivers that would get the segment to 4% to 6%?\nNoel White: Well, first typically, as we go into Q3, Q4 \u2013 our Q3, Q4, we do see a seasonal improvement that it takes place. So as I talked about Pork, same thing is true with Chicken that once we get into a little warmer weather that people fire up their grills demand does increase. So we're projecting typical seasonal strength in Chicken as well.\nTom Palmer: Okay. I mean the quick math is if you're running at 2.5% you'd be north of 5.5% in kind of the second half I guess?\nNoel White: If that's what the math says, I guess that's what I would say.\nTom Palmer: Okay. And then just wanted to ask on the Beef side, I mean it's not a huge cup but you did lower supply expectations. Is this mainly related to end of the year, what you're seeing in terms of some of the cattle inventory? And do you think we would actually exit the fiscal year with year-over-year declines in supply, or flattish, just trying to get the picture there. Thanks.\nNoel White: Yes Simon cattle supply is basically flat year-over-year. Cattle and feeder are actually up some. But pork month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, it does impact pricing and availability. But through the course of the year it all evens out. So as we look at the balance of 2020, basically flat if not a slight increase over 2019. Same thing would be true in 2021 that we look at the calf crop and it would say that we will have equal if not slightly greater number in 2020 and then basically flat into 2021. And then as we move into 2022, 2023 it really depends on retention rate of peppers and other factors that we closely monitor. So answer to your question would be basically flat supplies, perhaps a slight increase in 2020.\nTom Palmer: Okay. Thanks.\nNoel White: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Noel I just want to get your thoughts kind of from a much higher level as it pertains to coronavirus and maybe some of the more medium to longer-term impacts. Have you guys done anything \u2013 any work or just around, if wet markets in China are curbed here over the next several months? Just what has that meant historically in terms of the Chinese consumer turning to more of a grocery store? And does that benefit the import market more than say it would if consumers were at the wet markets?\nNoel White: Yes. Peter I think if anything it's just going to accelerate the efforts that the Chinese have had to decrease the number of wet markets. I think that we'll continue to see modern grocery continue to grow in China. So it's an acceleration. I think both ASF and coronavirus will contribute to that. Short term, obviously there's going to be some impact from coronavirus but that will pass. So we think on a much longer-term basis, it's how we will service modern retail in China. And over the course of relatively short period of time, we think that that will probably take place, particularly with the initiatives that the government has in place.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And Stewart, maybe just a quick clarification on the Prepared Foods side. With \u2013 and I know this was asked earlier but just with the volumes down and I think you mentioned some of it was kind of intersegment changes. I mean, without any profit impact, is that something we should kind of continue to expect over the course of the year that that volume might just optically look negative because of the segment change?\nStewart Glendinning: No. In fact, you'll only see it in this quarter. Last year \u2013 really this took place a year ago. And because of the seasonality of this product you see a little bit more impact in the quarter. As I said in total, the volume is not material. And certainly the profit is completely immaterial.\nPeter Galbo: So on a go-forward basis we would expect to kind of see that Nielsen and then the data that you guys kind of kind of converge a little bit more with reported results?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes that's correct. I mean you also need to bear in mind that the various Nielsen numbers and the foodservice numbers that some of those represent a portion of the volume. And certainly Jon can provide a little bit of a reconciliation during the follow-up call.\nNoel White: Peter, I think the takeaway needs to be that -- I mentioned that our core lines grew something a little greater than 6%. We captured at least 1% additional share points. And the numbers are just clouded by this production that moved from one segment to the other. So overall, our retail business continues to be extraordinarily strong.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nNoel White: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead.\nHeather Jones: Thanks for taking follow-up. So Noel, just to clarify a comment you just made a few minutes ago. So the closure of the live markets that we've seen in some provinces in China, are you saying that you expect China's ongoing shift away from live markets wildlife trade to more like grocery channels, are you saying you expect that shift to happen -- you mentioned something over the short-term, are you expecting that shift to happen over the short-term you said?\nNoel White: No, what I said is that I thought that the shift moving from wet markets to modern retail that the combination of ASF and coronavirus would expedite that transition.\nHeather Jones: Okay. Okay. And my other follow-up is just going back to your comments earlier about the outlook for Beef as far as what's going on in Australia global demand. So it sounds like you have a bullish view on beef trim costs. So could you speak to what your expectations are for chicken feature at retail? Not asking about any specific customers, but just in general, is it your expectation that chicken feature will benefit from beef trim costs this year?\nNoel White: The short answer would be, yes, Heather. I think that when we look at value between the proteins chicken is a -- particularly, chicken breast right now is in fact a tremendous value. And pork frankly as well with the quantity of pork that's being generated despite the fact that exports are up. And ground beef attributable to an increase of imported lean is relatively high priced compared to the alternatives. So I would expect to see more features of chicken as we move into spring and summer.\nHeather Jones: Okay, awesome. Thank you so much.\nNoel White: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJake Nivasch: Hi. Thank you. This is Jake Nivasch on for Rob. Thanks for the follow-up. Just a quick one. Is there any reason why you guys didn't confirm the EPS guidance that -- set from last call?\nStewart Glendinning: Well, Jake, we didn't give any EPS guidance on the last call and we're not planning to give EPS guidance for this year.\nJake Nivasch: On the press release though didn't you guys say high single-digit growth?\nStewart Glendinning: No, we did not. We talked about what our long-term algorithm looked like, but we did not address specifically anything for 2020.\nJake Nivasch: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Yeah. Good morning again. I just wanted to follow-up on Prepared Foods. So you made very clear during the call you had obviously some costs associated because of the ERP implementation that's adjusted for, but you've also mentioned the $80 million headwind due to beef trim and ham. So I was looking up at least so far what the quarter runs compared to last year and it seems still there is a fairly significant headwind in terms of ham cost, which clearly would result -- would kind of drive towards relatively weakness because of that cost for Prepared Foods, but then a benefit in Pork. So what is your expectation, I mean within that broader concept for your internal COGS on beef and ham and how that should turn out through the year with or without ASF? Just to understand a little bit the dynamics on the margin recovery on Prepared Foods where this is coming from?\nNoel White: Sure. Ben, yes, I can address that. And there was a spike in prices of both 90% lean beef as well as in hams. And we do not intend to take pricing action unless we believe that there is a shift that's taking place in pricing. As you look at ham pricing as we enter the fall, they presented a pretty good value and then they move counter-seasonally higher to about $0.90 on a volume basis. And subsequent to that they've come back down in fact fairly sharply most recently at least in the last couple of weeks. That is opposed to imported lean beef. And if we do believe that there is a longer-term shift in pricing that's when we would take pricing action. But we're -- we typically do not take pricing action on what we believe could be a short-term impact. And it doesn't matter if it's hams or if it's pork bellies for bacon or trim, only if we think that that shift has taken place and expect that to continue.\nBen Theurer: Okay. So in other words, if it were to persist a little longer or come back, you would start thinking of price increases, which would still take some time to offset so you modelize like -- potentially would not get to your margin on Prepared Foods somewhere between 10% to 12%, but then you should more than offset that with better margins within Beef and Pork or you're likely going to be above what the current guidance is. Is that fair to assume?\nNoel White: I think that's a fair assessment, Ben.\nBen Theurer: Okay. Thank you very much.\nNoel White: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Noel White for any closing remarks.\nNoel White: Well thank you for your time today. And please join us online for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders which starts at 11:00 Eastern Time. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stewart Glendinning",
            "content": "Thanks Noel and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results were inline with our expectations with earnings of $1.66 per share, up 5% from Q1, 2019. Operating income was $894 million, up 6% over last year. First quarter GAAP operating income was impacted $52 million or $0.11 per share for a restructuring charge and $16 million net of insurance proceeds or $0.03 per share for costs related to a fire at our beef plant in Finney County, Kansas. Sales in Q1 were up 6% to just over $10.8 billion with an 8.3% return on sales. Sales volume was up 4.7% and average sales price was up 1.4%. Our operating cash flows were $894 million for the quarter and liquidity was $1.4 billion at quarter end. Including cash of $497 million net debt was $11.2 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.7 times for the 12-month ending December 28. Net interest expense was $117 million in Q1. Capital expenditures were $312 million in the quarter and we continue to target an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital. Our capital allocation will continue to prioritize debt reduction while reinvesting in our business for organic growth buying back stock and increasing our dividend. In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $132 million. Weighted average shares outstanding were approximately $367 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 22.7% in the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization was $288 million. As Noel said, our newly acquired international businesses are contributing to the improvement in our International operations. Their contributions are inline with or better than our expectations, despite the high amortization and purchase price accounting loads placed on them. Noel has articulated our segment return on sales guidance which should give you an indication of how we expect our businesses to perform. Now I'd like to provide some additional commentary on our outlook. Keep in mind that fiscal 2020 is a 53-week year. However we have adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks. Net interest expense should approximate $450 million. We continue to project approximately $1.3 billion in CapEx for the fiscal year, as we progress with building additional processing capacity for case-ready fresh chicken, beef and pork and we plan to scale back CapEx when those projects are completed. We expect liquidity to remain above our $1 billion target. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%. I would like to remind you that Q2 is normally a weaker quarter for us and we have seen a slower than expected start in January. For Q2 fiscal year 2020, we are expecting lower earnings than Q1 driven by continued weak market conditions in chicken, higher raw material costs and some residual ERP impacts in Prepared Foods and normal seasonal cyclicality in beef and pork. When combined with the overall availability of protein a continuation of these factors will likely result in our earnings being lower than the same quarter last year. This is before any potential impacts to our business from coronavirus. Improvements in the back half are dependent upon achieving expected savings and pricing improvements in Chicken, managing to offset raw material cost increases in Prepared Foods and continued strong demand for beef and pork later in the year. That concludes my remarks and now we'll go back to Noel for additional commentary. Noel? Yes. I think, when you look at the -- this is Stewart. When you look at the reported volumes, those volumes reflect some channel shifts that we had between our segments. They don't account really for any profit on a total basis, so pretty immaterial. You see them in the quarter because of the kind of product. But the numbers we are giving you, in terms of the performance in the market, are more of the organic numbers that reflect the momentum of the business. Yes. Thank you. Well, just to be clear, this was a system that was implemented for both Chicken and Prepared. We see the impact only in Prepared at the moment. We don't want to give any specific guidance on the timing for that. Know that we're working aggressively. We are managing the factors that influence the write-offs and the distressed inventory that we see. And we of course expect to see improvement as we move forward. And one other thing -- sorry, Noel, if I can just go back to the previous question. I just want to make sure that I'm very clear. Ben, your question on, when we expect to see improvement, we have so far this quarter have seen run rates that have been consistent with last quarter. And just for clarity, as we're working on this, of course, we expect this not to be a permanent part of our business. I want to be really clear that, that improvement lies in front of us. Thank you. No. In fact, you'll only see it in this quarter. Last year \u2013 really this took place a year ago. And because of the seasonality of this product you see a little bit more impact in the quarter. As I said in total, the volume is not material. And certainly the profit is completely immaterial. Yes that's correct. I mean you also need to bear in mind that the various Nielsen numbers and the foodservice numbers that some of those represent a portion of the volume. And certainly Jon can provide a little bit of a reconciliation during the follow-up call. Well, Jake, we didn't give any EPS guidance on the last call and we're not planning to give EPS guidance for this year. No, we did not. We talked about what our long-term algorithm looked like, but we did not address specifically anything for 2020."

            "content": "Thanks Jon and good morning everyone. Along with Stewart, joining us in the room today is Dean Banks who joined the company at the beginning of the month and is beginning to transition to his new role as President of our company. Welcome Dean. We're pleased to report we delivered top and bottom-line growth in our first quarter and generated record Beef results. Before I speak to these results, I'd like to talk about our focus on sustainability to meet the growing global demand for protein that's why we recently announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos the creation of the Coalition for Global Protein. A combination of strategies and solutions including all forms of protein are needed to responsibly feed a world population expected to reach almost 10 billion in 2050 requiring an estimated doubling of the production of protein needed today. Our goal is to unite stakeholders across the food and agricultural sector to develop new and creative solutions to sustainably feed the world with affordable nutritious food. We believe this reflects positively on our strategy which is focused on sustaining our company and our world for future generations, while growing our business by delivering superior value to consumers and customers and fueling our growth and returns through commercial, operational, and financial excellence. Turning to our results, our overall first quarter was in line with expectations with adjusted earnings of $1.66 per share. Beef and Pork results were strong. Prepared Foods drove growth in retail consumption. The Chicken improved operationally, although continued to face soft pricing which weighed on results. Looking across the marketplace, consumption of our retail Prepared Food products has been outstanding. Both the Tyson core retail business lines which were up more than 5% and total Tyson retail up more than 3% outpaced volume and sales growth versus the top 10 retail food manufacturers in the 52 weeks ending December 28th. This growth contrasts with the total food and beverage category which was down 0.4% for the same period. We've now experienced six consecutive quarters of growth. Our core business lines are outpacing the categories with volume share growth of 1% and all core business lines are holding or growing share. In the Foodservice channel, our Foodservice Focus six product lines grew 3.5% and were twice the total broadline distribution channel growth of 1.6% over the last 13 weeks. The power of our Foodservice brands, innovation, and capabilities across all channels has set the stage for growth. In the last three months, Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage volume grew 10%; Tyson Red Label grew 17%; and the Tyson brand grew 8%. Now, let's take a look at our business segments. In Prepared Foods, growth and share performance has been outstanding, especially with our big brands. Retail innovation launched at the end of fiscal 2019 is performing well with velocities meeting or exceeding targets on the national launches of Jimmy Dean Biscuit Roll-Ups and Jimmy Dean Morning Combos with both demonstrating velocity performance in the top half of their respective categories. While still early, Biscuit Roll-Ups show potential for driving category growth. Prepared Foods profit margin in the first quarter was impacted by an $80 million increase in raw material costs driven by beef trim and hams. Some of this increase was offset by pricing though Prepared Foods may continue to experience volatile input costs. We continue to experience some operational effects from our recent ERP system implementation which impacted margins by roughly $40 million in the quarter. About half of this was discounted sales with the remainder related to inventory write-downs and donations. Although, the effects have persisted longer than anticipated, we continue to work aggressively to resolve them and we are seeing progress. In the alternative protein category, the Raised & Rooted brand is only the beginning of our plan to build the world's leading portfolio of plant protein products. In the back half of the year, we're planning multiple new launches across protein forms, brands, meal occasions and channels. Over time, we see these options as another stable protein complementing our core offerings. We're being practical and thoughtful in our approach to enable us to create better product experiences with healthier nutritious ingredients at affordable prices. Looking ahead for the Prepared Foods segment, we expect to maintain our momentum in the market. We will do this by continued investment behind our brands through marketing, promotions and innovation. And we will remain agile with pricing to offset input costs driven by the volatility of raw materials. For the fiscal year, we believe the Prepared Foods segment's adjusted operating margin will be 10% to 12%. Our Beef segment produced a record adjusted operating margin of 11.2% in the first quarter. The quality of domestic-fed cattle has been excellent. This makes every link of the beef supply chain more valuable, whether it's a producer, the packer or the retailer and results in a better product for consumers. Our premium programs continue to grow as a percentage of sales. Our customers and consumers are seeing the value in our quality and it's translating into increased revenue. Our Fresh Meats premium programs have nearly doubled over the last five years to approximately \u00a31 billion. I'm pleased to report that our Finney County, Kansas plant damaged by fire last August is now back to full operations. Beef exports are strong with the potential to be even stronger now that trade agreements have been formalized. I'd like to remind you however that our second quarter is typically our most challenging for Beef. In addition to the challenges caused by winter weather in the Midwest, the drought in Australia has forced a herd liquidation putting more beef on the global market. Looking ahead, exports from Australia are expected to decline substantially as the ongoing drought and the tragic fires are likely to delay their herd rebuilding. With Australian beef amounting to quarter of U.S. beef imports, this could be beneficial to our business. Our export sales continue to equal or exceed industry growth rates. For fiscal 2020, we're expecting our Beef segment's adjusted operating margin to meet the upper end of 6.5% to 7.5%. Moving to our Pork segment. Strong pork demand and solid operational execution along with ample hog supplies led to a 14% adjusted operating margin in Q1. Export markets were the primary driver for increased demand. We believe that we are at the very early stages of the global demand shifts that we've expected from African swine fever. We're filling additional orders to China and we've seen year-over-year increases nearly 600% in the first quarter and we're already benefiting from indirect shipments as we backfill in other markets. We've progressed towards a ractopamine-free hog supply. This will open up more markets to us as the need to move product globally increases. In fact, global demand for all proteins is increasing as ASF continues to reduce pork supplies in Asia. For fiscal 2020, we're expecting our Pork segment's adjusted operating margin to be 6% to 8%. Now turning to the Chicken segment. We're pleased that our execution is better and operations are on track to deliver $200 million year-over-year run rate improvement. However, pricing which has been weaker than expected was the primary driver of our return on sales in Q1, but softer pricing has persisted into the second quarter. All leading indicators point to domestic poultry supply growth and the USDA is projecting a 4% increase in chicken production. I previously indicated global protein suppliers being impacted by ASF, while demand continues to grow at about 2% per year. In light of ASF, we anticipate global demand will keep pace with U.S. supply growth as Chinese imports of U.S. chicken are expected to double. Domestically, we'll continue to innovate and drive demand in the frozen value-added space with products like Tyson Air Fried Chicken. This product launched last July with strong customer acceptance and is demonstrating dollar velocity performance in the top half of the category. Early data shows that the Tyson Air Fried Chicken is attracting new consumers and driving growth in this $2.6 billion category. Looking ahead in the Chicken segment, we expect an annual adjusted operating margin of 4% to 6% driven primarily by softer pricing and overall chicken supply. In International and Other, both our legacy and newly acquired businesses are contributing to our improved international performance. We see the potential to expand in these growth markets, which are estimated to drive 98% of global protein demand increases over the next five years with 70% of that growth coming from Asia. We have a business of scale and there are still synergies to unlock. We have high-quality assets and a strong team led by Chris Langholz who recently joined the company as President of International. Chris has an extensive background in global protein and we welcome him to the Tyson team. Our legacy International business are performing well increasing sales and earnings. The new acquisitions are providing great platforms for growth. We're committed to becoming the global leader in protein by serving emerging markets and strategic customers across channels and across segments. Across our businesses, trade deals are contributing to our optimism. We believe with improved access to global markets from recent trade deals, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the global marketplace. In addition to U.S. trade deals with Japan and South Korea, we're very pleased the Phase one trade agreement with China and the USMCA have both been signed. An important benefit of the deal with China is the inclusion of more protein eligible for shipment. We're shipping product to China and have more orders on the books. But keep in mind that tariffs that remain in place puts the U.S. at a pricing disadvantage in the Chinese market. If tariffs are lifted or reduced, we would likely see an acceleration of already increased global demand for U.S. pork, beef and chicken. We're closely monitoring news of the coronavirus. We're actively assessing what this outbreak may mean for us for our global business and preparing for the possibility of any impact. In China, we've been working with the government and have successfully restarted some of our operations. The financial impact is unknown at this time. With that I'll now ask Stewart to take us through the financials. Thank you, Stewart. Supply-demand dynamics have become much more global and our diversified business model and global footprint put us where the growth is occurring and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. In addition, we're encouraged by potential increased, export demand and the resulting reduced domestic availability of proteins. In closing, our strong brands, strong team, world-class assets, great customers and a global footprint to meet growing demand for protein leave us well positioned for future success. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we're ready to begin Q&A. Good morning, Alexia. Yeah. Actually we are very pleased that our government has come to trade agreements just since our last conference call with Japan and Korea, Phase one agreement with China with USMCA. So we're very pleased with the progress that our government has made. Shipments continue and interest has been strong. We are currently shipping and we have more orders on the books for China. And our business in the other countries that I mentioned continue to be strong as well not only those countries, but other countries around the world. So from a trade perspective, it looks very promising. And as you might have seen overnight some of the tariffs that have been in place with China were lowered by approximately 5%. So that's great progress as well. Alexia, first of all, I think pork continues to be a great value in the marketplace. And whether it's beef or chicken, chicken is also very attractively priced and whether there's room to raise prices on pork I think it really depends on what happens to cutout over the course of the next 60 days or so. I don't think retailers are going to immediately going to change prices because of some short-term increases in wholesale prices. I think that if they believe that that will continue to be the case then they will. I think it's too soon to call. Very good. Thank you. Good morning, Ken. Sure Ken. First of all, our chicken operations, if you remember last quarter I said that we expected a $200 million improvement year-over-year in 2020 versus 2019 purely from a performance standpoint. And I am pleased to say that we are on track for the run rate of capturing that $200 million. So our plants continue to perform better than what they were. However, the pricing environment on poultry has been relatively weak and that's obvious in public available data, so the improvements that we've captured purely from a performance standpoint has been either offset or more than offset by the weakness in wholesale pricing. Absolutely. Yes. Ken, I can't give you an exact number as to what the expectation of the increase is going to be. I think it will certainly increase. And if we take back through 2019, there was a run-up in hog prices in the spring and exports didn't material quite as quickly as what was expected. There were heavy shipments coming out of both South America and Europe to China. And then the Chinese stepped into the U.S. market and we saw the effect of that in the fall. And a lot of the product arrived and cleared in time for the Chinese New Year. There's product that continues to ship. There continues to be interest in pork and the same thing would be true with beef and with poultry. So interest has been strong. Demand has been good. And the other thing I mentioned on the call last quarter is that we expected to backfill into other markets. And that in fact has happened. Our shipments to some of the other countries have in fact increased. So it's not just China, it's to other countries around the world as well. Yeah, thank you. Yes. We do think that there will be a positive impact Rob on exports. We are expecting the four production -- 4% production increase. We are expecting to continue to see growth in demand from an export standpoint not only to China but to other places in the world as well. Yes. And Rob I think we need to keep in mind that when we talk about exports into the different markets that there's strength in certain products, there's weaknesses in certain products when we talk about chicken. So the USDA data would indicate that chicken breast pricing in particular has been weak. On the other hand there has been strength in other products such as boneless skinless thighs and tenders and wings. So it's not as simple as just thinking chicken, but it's specific parts that there's strength and weaknesses. Right. Rob, I -- first of all there was very favorable weather conditions as we came through fall for growing conditions. I think the weight of the chicken as an industry was up year-over-year. I know that ours was certainly heavier, heavier than what we originally projected and I just have to assume that that's probably the case with others in the industry as well. Historically, the U.S. increase over the course of time has averaged at about a 2% growth rate and that's a pretty well-kept pace with what the increase in demand has been. So over the course of 12 months it's hard for me to say, but I think over the course of time that we think in terms of about 2% that that's kind of where my mindset would be. Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Good question Heather. When Rob asked the question about production increases and I mentioned that the weights were heavier than expected that is in fact true with us and breast meat production as well. So we did use more internally. We did not buy as much on the outside market as what we had originally projected or planned to. Corrections have been made Heather that our buy versus grow strategy remains intact. However in Q1, it was not exactly as we planned. Heather every day brings something new. The news overnight was welcome. If anything I'd say that we're going to have quite a bit of volatility. As I mentioned demand continues to be -- or interest at least continues to be strong. There is certainly the need and coronavirus has just clouded that a bit frankly Heather. There has been disruptions. There's been disruptions in domestic production. There's been disruption at the ports. So that has skewed shipments receivables. I would expect that we get -- once we get past the coronavirus incident whenever that might be that, I do think that there's going to be a very strong demand coming out of that. But trying to estimate what that time period is going to be is not possible at this point. Thank you. Sure. Ben, our Q1 October, November, December is typically the strongest margin quarter for us and it's not unusual for us to drop off in Q2. So we're basically following the typical seasonal patterns that we would see. And normally we'll see things start to improve in Q2. And then through the summer it's not bad. And then in Q1, October, November, December it strengthens pretty substantially. So we're just projecting that the basic seasonal patterns that we've seen in the past. In this case yes. Yeah. Ben, that's impossible to say what volumes would have been without the fire. I think the distinction was basically that the strength in our export demand and I think it's more of a demand story than restricted supply story. So don't know what supply would have been without the fire, but I do know that demand has been extraordinarily strong both domestically and from an export standpoint in Beef. Thank you, Ben. Good morning. Yeah. Adam, first of all I can't talk about pricing. It's a very sensitive subject. Most of the pricing is concluded not all of it, but most of it. And I would say that, as we came through our Q1 and as we enter Q2 breast meat pricing in particular is weaker than I would have expected it to be. However, as I mentioned earlier there has been strength in other products. Leg quarter pricing frankly has been a bit erratic as we came through Q1 January, February and don't know at this point what March, April, May is going to hold. A lot of those prices are not yet settled so that would be purely speculate on my behalf. However, with breast meat USDA's data would say it's trading something below $1 right now so it's at or near historic lows. It presents a tremendous value both at retail and at foodservice. And typically when that happens you see some type of increase in either featuring or promotions at foodservice establishments. So I think that over the course of time and whether that's one month or six months, we're going to see increased promotion on those proteins that are of greatest value. And right now that would include chicken breast. Good morning, Ben. You're right, Ben, that is a sensitive question. Now, the production in our Q1, it was heavier than it was originally projected. And we, as always, respond to things that we don't expect, so you can fully expect that to take place. And as far as timing of the Humboldt start-up, nothing has changed with that. The project is on schedule and on budget. Michael, with fast food, different customers use different-sized birds, so it's not possible to say that's advantaging one segment versus another. If we go back a couple of years ago, we saw hamburgers being heavily promoted. And, obviously, this last year that switched to chicken burgers and -- or chicken sandwiches and it looks like this year that we're going to see the same thing. And that's purely because of the value that chicken has right now. And ground pork and beef prices are higher. The lean beef, particularly lean imported beef, is up substantially due to the reasons I talked about in the script, with drought conditions and the shortage of supply coming on, on the imported side. Well, okay. Michael first of all I cannot talk about what specific customers may or may not be doing. But I think that there will be sufficient supply, regardless on whatever customer that you might be referring to. So I don't see an issue from a supply standpoint but can't talk specifically about any specific customer. Well, first typically, as we go into Q3, Q4 \u2013 our Q3, Q4, we do see a seasonal improvement that it takes place. So as I talked about Pork, same thing is true with Chicken that once we get into a little warmer weather that people fire up their grills demand does increase. So we're projecting typical seasonal strength in Chicken as well. If that's what the math says, I guess that's what I would say. Yes Simon cattle supply is basically flat year-over-year. Cattle and feeder are actually up some. But pork month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, it does impact pricing and availability. But through the course of the year it all evens out. So as we look at the balance of 2020, basically flat if not a slight increase over 2019. Same thing would be true in 2021 that we look at the calf crop and it would say that we will have equal if not slightly greater number in 2020 and then basically flat into 2021. And then as we move into 2022, 2023 it really depends on retention rate of peppers and other factors that we closely monitor. So answer to your question would be basically flat supplies, perhaps a slight increase in 2020. Thank you. Yes. Peter I think if anything it's just going to accelerate the efforts that the Chinese have had to decrease the number of wet markets. I think that we'll continue to see modern grocery continue to grow in China. So it's an acceleration. I think both ASF and coronavirus will contribute to that. Short term, obviously there's going to be some impact from coronavirus but that will pass. So we think on a much longer-term basis, it's how we will service modern retail in China. And over the course of relatively short period of time, we think that that will probably take place, particularly with the initiatives that the government has in place. Peter, I think the takeaway needs to be that -- I mentioned that our core lines grew something a little greater than 6%. We captured at least 1% additional share points. And the numbers are just clouded by this production that moved from one segment to the other. So overall, our retail business continues to be extraordinarily strong. Thank you. No, what I said is that I thought that the shift moving from wet markets to modern retail that the combination of ASF and coronavirus would expedite that transition. The short answer would be, yes, Heather. I think that when we look at value between the proteins chicken is a -- particularly, chicken breast right now is in fact a tremendous value. And pork frankly as well with the quantity of pork that's being generated despite the fact that exports are up. And ground beef attributable to an increase of imported lean is relatively high priced compared to the alternatives. So I would expect to see more features of chicken as we move into spring and summer. Thank you. Sure. Ben, yes, I can address that. And there was a spike in prices of both 90% lean beef as well as in hams. And we do not intend to take pricing action unless we believe that there is a shift that's taking place in pricing. As you look at ham pricing as we enter the fall, they presented a pretty good value and then they move counter-seasonally higher to about $0.90 on a volume basis. And subsequent to that they've come back down in fact fairly sharply most recently at least in the last couple of weeks. That is opposed to imported lean beef. And if we do believe that there is a longer-term shift in pricing that's when we would take pricing action. But we're -- we typically do not take pricing action on what we believe could be a short-term impact. And it doesn't matter if it's hams or if it's pork bellies for bacon or trim, only if we think that that shift has taken place and expect that to continue. I think that's a fair assessment, Ben. Thank you. Well thank you for your time today. And please join us online for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders which starts at 11:00 Eastern Time. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Megan Britt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nMegan Britt: Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call for Tyson Foods. Prepared remarks today will be provided by Donnie King, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stewart Glendinning, EVP, and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, David Bray, Group President Poultry, Noelle O'mara, Group President Prepared Foods, and Shane Miller, Group President Fresh Meats will join the live Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks and these are available on the Investor Relations section of the Tyson website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which may cause actual results to differ materially from our current projections. Please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimer on slide 2, as well as our SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections. Please note that references to earnings per share, operating income, and operating margin, and our remarks are on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise noted. For reconciliations on these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release. I'll now turn the call over to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thank you, Megan. I'll start by saying that the safety of our team members continue to be our top priority, and I'm very pleased that we now have a team in the U.S. that is fully vaccinated. As we focus on meeting the needs of our customers and consumers, vaccination is the best way that we can protect our team members from the impacts related to COVID-19 and ensure business continuity. Earlier today, we reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth in a challenging year. Our performance was supported by continued strength in consumer demand for protein. Our retail core business lines which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park have driven strong share growth in the retail channel, delivering 13 quarters of consecutive growth. Continued recovery in the food service channel led by QSRs, also supported our strong results. Overall, we saw our volume recovery in the second half from the pandemic lows to finish the fiscal year only slightly down. We are taking several deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes including investing behind capacities, brand, and product innovation, and our team members. Our investments in team members include our successful vaccination mandate as well as automation and technology initiatives that I'll discuss in a moment. The construction of the 12 new plants that we've mentioned previously are progressing well, and once complete, will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and growing global demand for protein. These new capacities include 9 chicken plants, 2 case-ready beef and pork plants, and 1 new bacon plant. In parallel to our actions to improve volume, we have also worked to recover inflation through pricing, achieving a 13 % price improvement for the fiscal year and a 24 % increase for the fourth quarter. In this dynamic environment, we will be aggressive in monitoring inflation and driving price recovery activities. And the diversity of our portfolio showed its value again this quarter as demonstrated by earnings performance in our beef segment supported the delivery of a strong fiscal year earnings results. Our performance has allowed us to build financial strength. Our Balance Sheet is strong, resilient, and provides Tyson the optionality needed to pursue strategic growth priorities. And to that point, our investment in future growth across our portfolio continue. We demonstrated resilience in fiscal year 2021, and we are entering fiscal 2022 with tremendous momentum. Our results demonstrate the dedication of our global team, the importance of our diverse portfolio strategy, and our ability to meet consumer demand across proteins, channels, and meal occasions. Now turning to financial results, let me give you some highlights overall. I was pleased with both a strong quarter and full-year. Sales improved 20 % in the fourth quarter and 11 % during the full year. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price. Average sales price trends reflect successful pricing strategies during the ongoing inflationary environment, but we still have opportunities specifically in prepared foods, where we delivered softer results than anticipated. Like many other companies, we were faced with a range of higher levels of inflation; notably higher grains, labor, meat, and transportation costs. Our teams have worked together with our customers to pass along that inflation through price increases. On volume, we saw improvement in the second half relative to the same period last year. Volumes were up 3 % for the second half or nearly 350 million pounds. Although we're working diligently to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and ability to achieve optimal mix across our processing footprint. Having said that, we're taking aggressive actions as a team to address the labor constraints, and we're seeing improvement. We delivered solid operating income performance, up 26 % during the fourth quarter and 42 % for the full year. This performance was largely due to strength in our beef segment, where continued strong consumer demand and ample cattle supply have driven higher earnings. Overall, our operating income performance translated to earnings per share of $2.30 for the fourth quarter, up 35 %, and $8.28 for the full year, up 53 %. Looking at our results on volume. We're taking aggressive actions to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. For the fiscal year, our volume was down slightly. Customer demand during the fiscal '21 outpaced our ability to supply products, but we're working aggressively to fill that void. We recognize how important service levels are to our customers, and we're committed to improving our fill rates and reliability of supply. With respect to supply, we have focused on ensuring our ability to maintain business continuity, and our team has been resilient in the face of numerous supply chain challenges. As we look towards fiscal '22, improving volumes will be key to delivering against our commitments. We expect to grow our total Company volumes by 2% to 3% next year, outpacing overall protein consumption growth. A large percentage of that growth will come from the chicken segment. And across our business, we're working to optimize our product portfolio, remove complexities, enhance capacities, and pursue operational improvement initiatives to deliver against these volume growth objectives. Moving now to Slide 6, we acknowledge the challenging and competitive labor environment, and it's no secret that we want to be the most sought after place to work. We fully understand that this starts with an unrelenting focus on safety every minute, every shift, every day. The health, safety, and wellness of our team members has been and will continue to be our top priority. So, I'd like to take a minute to stop and commend our team members and our leadership team for doing their part to keep themselves, their colleagues, their families, and their communities safe, which has helped us reach our vaccination goals. But vaccines and investments in COVID-19 protection measures are certainly not the only actions that we've taken to become the most sought after place to work. To ensure that every Tyson team member feels as though they can bring their true and complete self to work each day, we've invested behind diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. And we also understand the importance of a strong compensation offering, and we believe that we hold a leadership position in this space. We have raised wages and across our business today, we pay an average of $24 per hour, which includes full medical, vision, dental, and other benefits like access to retirement plan and sick pay, and we will continue to explore other innovative benefit offerings that remove barriers and make our team members lives easier. We're also accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make existing roles safer and easier while reducing cost. We're confident that our actions will increase Tyson's staffing levels and position us for volume growth. Relating to operational excellence and market competitiveness, today, we are announcing the launch of a new productivity program, designed to drive a better, faster, and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The program is targeted to deliver 1 billion in recurring productivity savings of the end of fiscal '24 relative to fiscal 2021 cost baseline. These savings are included in the guidance expectations as Stewart will share in a moment. Execution of the effort will be supported by a program management office that will ensure delivery of key project milestones and report on savings achievements connected to 3 imperatives. The first is operational and functional excellence and is targeted to deliver greater than $300 million in recurring savings. This includes functional efficiency efforts in finance, HR, and procurement that are focused on applying best practices to reduce cost. The second is digital solutions, which is targeted to deliver more than $250 million in recurring savings. We'll achieve this goal by leveraging new digital solutions like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to drive efficiency and operations, supply chain planning, logistics, and warehousing. For example, we're using technology to ensure that our shipments are optimally loaded to say freight costs and enhance customer service levels. In many ways, the pandemic has already accelerated our push to more digital footing and our commitment in this space will continue that focus. The third is automation. We will leverage automation and robotics technologies to automate difficult and higher turnover positions. For example, we have substantial opportunity to automate the deboned process within our poultry harvest facilities using a combination of both third-party and proprietary technologies. Chicken remains a top priority for me personally and for our Company. We continue to execute against our roadmap to bring operating income margin to at least the 5 % to 7 % range on a run rate basis by mid fiscal '22. Our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. The first imperative is to be the most sought after place to work. I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. This will ensure that we have the right levels of staffing to fulfill our customer orders on time and in full. The second imperative is to improve operational performance. Critical to improving operational performance is maximizing our fixed cost of leverage, which means having enough birds in our internal networks to run our plants full. Reconfiguring and optimizing our existing footprint, we can increase our harvest capacity by more than 10 % without building another plant. In addition, we have clear initiatives to remove complexity from our plants, reduce transportation and handling, and minimize waste. Our operational improvements will unlock significant unused capacity in our network and take advantage of the fixed cost leverage. Each of these initiatives will support leading operational performance from our chicken business in the future. Patch rates have impacted our ability to do this, and we've shared the initiatives underway to correct this. Our new mail roll-out is progressing as planned, and we believe we've hit the inflection point that will lead to sequential improvements through the entirety of fiscal 2022. The new mail roll-out at our pullet farms is nearly complete, and we continue to observe improved hatch rates associated with these new mails. We've also mentioned how strengthened spot prices for commodity chicken products throughout the fiscal year has put our buy-versus-grow program at a relative disadvantage versus history. From Q3 to Q4, we again reduced our rate of outside purchases, this time by nearly 30 %. The final imperative is to service our customers, on time and in full. Tyson's branded value-added product offerings have continued to gain share during both the fourth quarter and the latest 52 weeks and new capacity expansions will help us maintain momentum. Inflation has clearly had an impact on the business. Our commercial teams have successfully pursued inflation justified pricing, delivering top-line growth for the business to offset the cost increases. As rates of inflation continue, so will our pricing actions. Whether in equivalent level of emphasis on disciplined operational execution and volume throughput. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow volumes, and be the best chicken business. The plan we have in place is still the right plan, and our level of confidence, conviction, and excitement as the team continue to grow. Looking forward to fiscal year 2022, I feel confident our ability to drive value creation. We have strong consumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels, and a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. Our priorities are clear. Winning with customers and consumers, winning with team members, and winning with excellence in execution. With these priorities as our guide, we're taking aggressive actions to accelerate our growth relative to the overall market, improve operating margins, and drive stronger returns on invested capital. We are committed to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety, and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment every shift, every day, every location, with no exceptions. We have shown that we are willing to take bold actions in support of this commitment. Second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better serve demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales, by focusing our product portfolio and by adding capacity to meet demand. We expect our volume to outpace the market in the intermediate term. Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our check-in segment. This starts by returning our operating margin to the 5 % to 7 % level by the middle of fiscal 2022. Fourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence, and investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our new productivity program. We are working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy, enhanced decision-making speed across the organization. Finally, to address expected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business through both organic investments and strategic M&A. On capital alone, we expect to invest $2 billion in fiscal year 2022 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. Tyson has the right portfolio, the consumer-driven insight, and the scale and the capabilities to win in the marketplace across proteins, channels and meal occasions. We also have the financial strength to invest behind our business to accelerate growth and to maintain our momentum. I look forward to sharing with you our progress as we work through the year, and I'll be sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in a few weeks. I will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail.\nStewart Glendinning: Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary about total Company financial results. We're pleased to report a strong overall finish to the year. Sales were up approximately 20 % in the fourth quarter, largely a function of our successful pricing initiatives that were pursued to offset inflationary pressures. Volumes were down 4 % during the fourth quarter, primarily due to labor challenges, hampering our efforts to fully benefit from strong retail demand and recovery in food service. Fourth quarter operating income of nearly $1.2 billion was up 26 % due to continued strong performance in our beef business. For the full year, operating income improved in nearly $4.3 billion up 42 %. Driven by the strength in operating income, fourth-quarter EPS grew 35 % to $2.30 with the full-year up 53 % to $8.28. Slide 11 bridges our total Company sales for fiscal year '21. Sales dollars were up across all segments. As you can see, the most substantial sales dollars benefit came from the Beef segment, which saw market conditions that led to a wider than historical cutout margin. At the same time, we saw price increases across the business to offset the high levels of inflation we faced. Looking at our channel results, sales at retail drove over $1 billion of top-line improvement versus last year, even after exceptionally strong volumes in the comparable period. Improvements in sales through the food service channel drove an increase of $1.6 billion and our fiscal year export sales were nearly $1 billion stronger than the prior year. As we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. Slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was about $1.3 billion higher than fiscal 2020. As I mentioned previously, volumes were down slightly during the year, primarily a result of a challenging labor environment. Our pricing actions and strength in the Beef segment led to approximately $5.6 billion of sales price mix benefit, which more than offset the higher COGS price mix of $4.6 billion. We saw inflation across the business. Notable areas were in wages, grain costs, live animal costs, and pork, meat cost, and prepared foods, and freight costs across the enterprise. Incremental direct COVID-19 costs were favorable by approximately $200 million during the year. Also, our total spending at $335 million was still substantial. The decrease was driven primarily by cycling one-time bonuses that were paid last year. And a large portion of that was reinvested in permanent wage increases for our team members this year. Lower one-time bonus costs were partially offset by higher testing and vaccination costs incurred during fiscal 2021. While these costs are expected to reduce in fiscal '22, we will continue to spend against initiatives to keep our team members safe. And finally, SG&A was over $100 million [Indiscernible] to prior year, which was largely a result of a net benefit associated with the beef supplier fraud. Now, moving to the beef segment. Segment and sales were over $5 billion for the quarter up 26 % versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products. Offsetting higher sales prices were higher cattle costs up more than 20 % during the fourth quarter. We had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. And we have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs. Sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago, driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion or 22.9% for the fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. While our Beef segment experienced strong results during the quarter and fiscal year, we're still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput due to labor challenges, which we expect to normalize over the course of fiscal '22. Now, let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 14. Segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 30 % versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased more than 40 %. Our volumes were down relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $78 million for the quarter down 52 % versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined to 4.7% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 7 % relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down 5.7% in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in food service more than offset by labor challenges. Sales growth outpaced volume growth, driven by inflation justified pricing and better sales mix. During the fourth quarter, retail core business lines experienced the 13th straight quarter of volume share growth driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong brand execution by our team. Operating margins for the segment were 1.7% or $39 million for the fourth quarter. A slowdown in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw material input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter. For the full-year, operating income margin was 7.6% or $672 million. As we mentioned last quarter, the ongoing inflationary environment created a meaningful headwind for Prepared Foods during the fourth quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging, and labor have increased our cost of production. We've executed pricing, revenue management, and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. We expect to take continued pricing actions to ensure that any inflationary cost increases that our business incurs are passed along. Our pricing has lagged inflation, but we expect to recover those cost increases during fiscal '22. Moving into the Chicken segment's results, sales were $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter, up 21 %. Volumes improved 1.3% in the quarter. has strong consumer demand offset both labor challenges and the detrimental impact of a fire at our hands build rendering facility. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes, and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal '22 as the hatch rate recovers, and we operate our plants more efficiently. Average sales price improved over 20 % in the fourth quarter and 11.4% for the fiscal year compared to the same periods last year. This increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation. Our pricing has admittedly lagged our realization of cost inflation, but we made tremendous progress in the last few months to close that gap and are now seeing those benefits. We have restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal '21 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions. Chicken experienced an operating loss of $113 million in the fourth quarter. The segment earned $24 million representing an operating margin of 0.2% for the fiscal year 2021. Operating income was negatively impacted by $945 million of higher feed ingredient costs, grow out expenses, and outside meat purchases. For the fourth quarter, feed ingredients with $325 million higher than the same period last year. Segment performance also reflects net derivative losses of $75 million during the fourth quarter, which was a $120 million worse than the same period last year. Turning to Slide 17. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially delivered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.2 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA as we paid down $2 billion of debt while growing our earnings and cash flow. Investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. Each of these leaders will support strong return generation for our shareholders. We will also continue to explore parts to optimize our portfolio through M&A, through the lens of the value creation and shareholder return. Finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We're pleased to announce that last week our board approved a $0.06 increase to our annual dividend payment, now totaling $1.84 per Class A share. Let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. We currently anticipate total Company sales between $49 billion and $51 billion, which translate to sales growth of between 5 % and 7 %. We expect 2 % to 3 % volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full. Our new productivity initiatives is expected to deliver $300 to $400 million of savings during fiscal '22, driven by operational and functional excellence initiatives. The roll-out of digital solutions across the enterprise and extensive automation projects that are currently underway. Now, as we look at the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect a meaningful increase in CapEx spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles. We currently anticipate CapEx spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal '22, an increase of roughly $800 million. This investment will support our initiatives to meet global protein demand growth into the future, allow us to gain share and will deliver strong financial returns for our shareholders. Excluding the impact of changes from potential tax legislation, we currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23 %. We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $380 million because of intentional deleveraging during fiscal '21. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our target while net leverage is expected to remain well below 2 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. It is important to note though that over the last 2 years, working capital has been a source of cash. We don't expect this to be the case in fiscal '22. Moving forward, our business growth where we require increased working capital, which combined with deferred tax payments under the CARES Act, taxes on the gain of the pet treats divestiture, litigation settlements, and other discrete items will lead to a substantial use of cash during fiscal 2022. Now, let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to that total Company performance. Prepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7 % and 9 %. We will remain disciplined and agile in our pricing initiatives to ensure that any additional inflationary pressures are passed along to customers, while also working diligently to deliver productivity savings to reduce costs. We expect the Beef segment to continue to show strength due to prolonged industry dynamics, leading to segment margins of between 9 % and 11 %. We expect the front half for the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year. In chicken, our operational turnaround is working, and we still expect to achieve run-rate profitability of 5 % to 7 % by the middle of the year. We expect this will be achieved through sequential quarterly margin improvements during the first half of the year, resulting in full-year margins that fall between 5 % to 7 % of our expected at the lower end of that range. In pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21, equating to a margin of between 5 % and 7 %. In International and other, we expect margins of 2 % to 3 % as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability. Our segments individually and an aggregate have clear in compelling role within Tyson's portfolio strategy. They deliver diverse counter cyclical performance that supports the Company's long-term earnings objectives and delivers strong value for shareholders. I will now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&A instructions. Megan?\nMegan Britt: Thanks, Stewart. We'll now move to your questions. Please recall that our caution on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And at this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And the first question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, please go ahead.\nBen Bienvenu: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nStewart Glendinning: Morning.\nDonnie King: Morning.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to ask within the commentary on the guidance, the productivity savings of $300 million to $400 million for this year and $1 billion by the end of 2024, could you talk about how much of that you expect to be realized on a net basis to the bottom line and how much of it might be reinvested back into the business to drive growth?\nStewart Glendinning: Ben, good morning, Stewart here. Look, we're trying to drive for as much of it as possible to the bottom line, but keep in mind that our assumptions around what's going to drop to the bottom line are already embedded in the guidance that we've given you by segment, but that's the short story.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, perfect. And then if I look at the balance sheet, your -- even with a pretty substantial increase in capital expenditures for 2022, you're going to have a cash build potentially. So, I know, Stewart, you noted some commentary on the business, the working capital being a use of cash in 2022; could you talk about what you expect that use of cash to look like so that we can get a sense of what the cash balance at year end looks like? And then along the same lines, you talked about reinvestment in M&A; what is your prioritization of that relative to potentially share repurchase given that you've upped the authorization there?\nStewart Glendinning: Okay. Right. Let me unpack that a little bit -- yes. Look, we're super pleased with the way the year has worked out. This is really a diverse portfolio that's delivered a great result and that's driven the increase in cash. So sitting at 1.2 times leverage, we've got $1 billion of debt that will come through this year. We're planning to pay that down. We also, as you called out, are going to have a much larger expenditure on CapEx, which is going to be great for our investors. And as our business grows, that's going to consume some more working capital -- regular working capital. In addition to that, we've got a number of one-off payments that we expect to pay out this year, which are pretty meaningful. And to characterize that as around a billion dollars of deferred taxes related to the CARES Act, taxes that are owed on the sale of the pet business, as well as some payout of the litigation accruals that you've seen in our books.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay.\nStewart Glendinning: To M&A, maybe the last question on an M&A versus buyback. Look, it's a normal course. We don't comment on any specific M&A, but we've shared the levers in our business. We have successfully pulled all those levers over the last number of years, and I think that's been a good effect. We don't imagine that we're going to change that this year.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Fair enough. Great. Thanks and look forward to catching up with you guys at the Investor Day.\nStewart Glendinning: Thank you.\nDonnie King: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Good morning, Donnie, Stewart.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nBen Theurer: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the results. Now, just to unfold one thing and maybe you can help us a little bit on what you're planning into 2022. So, clearly, it feels like a lot of your growth in the quarter was impacted by lack of labor, be it in beef, be it in pork. I mean, you've pointed out in the segment commentary that there was a lot around labor shortage, and we know you've been invested in people, but what do you have to do looking into 2022 to overcome these headwinds on the labor market, just in order to get actually the volume out -- you want to get out? Because it seems like you have the assets but you don't have the people to process. Is that a fair assumption?\nDonnie King: Let me take that, Stewart, and good morning. Labor has been very challenging throughout the year, but as we've mentioned in the script earlier, we're seeing a light at the end of this tunnel. We're seeing our ability to get plant staffed, -- I think from a poultry perspective. For example, we're almost fully staffed since November 1, we've made great progress across Prepared Foods and our beef and pork businesses, so we're gaining on that post the close of our vaccine mandate. So we're very optimistic about '22. But in addition to having a labor shortfall, which is constrained capacity, we've also had just capacity shortfall in some key categories. For example, ready-to-eat products that would be for the more value-added poultry and also for Prepared Foods. And again, we're just now bringing on 2 new case-ready beef and pork plants to enable us to have more capacity in there in a startup mode. So yes, labor has been a challenge. We're seeing progress. We're very excited about '22 from that perspective. We believe we've got the worst behind us and we're looking forward to that, but we're also -- we got 12 new plants going or under construction to deliver more capacity, and we have strong demand for that. And so, we look forward to what that will deliver for us not only this year, but also in the coming years.\nBen Theurer: And then within Prepared Foods, clearly, we're seeing the headwinds from some of the input cost most here and just you holding back a little bit on pushing through price with that operating income margin adjusted down to a little less than 2 %. Now, the guidance for next year basically implies something flat. Does that mean on over the course of the year, would you just think about still headwinds in the first half and as pricing comes through in the second half, we're going to see that picking up a little bit or how should we think about the cadence of margins into 2022 in the Prepared Foods business?\nDonnie King: Hi, Ben. I'll make a couple of comments and I'll pass that onto our expert, Noelle O'mara, who leads our Prepared Foods businesses. And so it's -- you'd characterize much of it. We're trying to absorb the rapid inflation, predominantly in pork products and meat. And as we go with this branded portfolio that we have to the marketplace, it's no different than any other CPHE (ph) Company has dealt with. You're trying to balance share and price, and it takes a little bit of time, unlike the commodity portion of our business, say beef and pork, and takes a little more time to get that executed. We're looking for ways, always looking for ways to try to expedite that process but it takes a bit to be able to get customers aligned, to be able to get promotional and those activities aligned. But let me stop with that and I'll toss it over to Noelle to add some color as well.\nNoelle O\u2019mara: Sure. Thanks, Donnie. As we mentioned, demand continues to be incredibly strong across the portfolio. Our Q4 performance was impacted because of the inflationary environment accelerating faster than anticipated. Despite the unprecedented inflationary headwinds, the actions that we took in the second half of '21 and the beginning here of '22, I expect will allow us to offset the headwinds and drive sequential improvements in profitability.\nBen Theurer: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nDonnie King: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nStewart Glendinning: Morning, Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Donnie and Noelle, I'd like to get your thoughts on this. As you're taking a lot more pricing in Prepared and across the rest of the portfolio, just what are you seeing from a consumer perspective in terms of trade down? Is our elasticity still kind of holding or I should say, holding at an inelastic level or are you starting to see just some of that roll through? And how do you think about the end of '22 as prices continue to go up?\nNoelle O\u2019mara: Let me take that. Demand continues to be strong across the portfolio on both retail and food service. We're pleased with the market performance we're seeing despite the price increases. Elasticity has been less than historical models would've predicted. We're seeing penetration in buy-rate increases versus pre - COVID, levels across categories, as Donnie referenced. We've had our 13th consecutive quarter of share growth, but we'll continue to learn and adapt as more landscape as all.\nPeter Galbo: That's helpful. Thank you. And then Donnie, in terms of the productivity plan and the CapEx, is there a way for us to think about it? You used some helpful detail on the slides, but just to think about it by segment?\nDonnie King: Well, let me start. Peter was saying, it applies to all segments and the first part of the program has to do with operational and functional excellence. And quite frankly, that is really doing our jobs better, taking out ways to removing bureaucracy. And that's primarily targeted against our finance, human resources, and procurement groups; is executing at a much higher level. There's another component that is digital solutions and that's about $250 million in recurring savings. That's more on the operational side, that supply chain planning, logistics, and warehousing, so you can think of that in that bucket, and that's across all businesses. In fact, the first 2 are across all businesses. And then third, automation, leveraging robotics and technology and we're spending a significant portion of the $2 billion in capital that we're spending. A disproportionate amount of that is going against capacity expansion in these 12 plants that we talked about over the next 3 years. But, in addition to that, it's to put automation and technology and to eliminate difficult, higher turnover jobs. Take, for example, debone automation, whether it be for the white meat or dark meat. Think about in terms of material handling and you would see more of that in our Prepared Foods group. And then you've got -- if we think about outside the U.S. then we just have a -- I'd say a plethora of automation and technology, and a digital footprint as we build those plants up outside of the U.S.\nOperator: The next question will come from a Anoori Naughton with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAnoori Naughton: Hi. Good morning. We wanted to get some additional color on some of the chicken initiatives you discussed. You talked about optimization efforts increasing the harvest capacity by 10 %. Over what time-frame are you thinking you'll be able to achieve that level of capacity expansion? And does the run rate EBITDA margin of 5 % to 7 % already contemplate that higher fixed cost leverage from these efforts?\nDonnie King: Great question. Let me -- I'll start out and then give you some very top-line stuff and I'll flip it over to David Bray who leads our Poultry group. Think of this in terms of the 5 % to 7 % being a waypoint and we've communicated that we think by the middle part of '22 that that's where we will be. That's not the goal, that's the waypoint, and we backed into that. But if you think about those building blocks that are necessary to get there and beyond, it's really starting with volume. And we've talked a lot about the hatch issue that we've had in the male and as we move into '22, we're already seeing great results. Remember this male that we put in is not new to the world, it's 1 we've used and delivered great results for years, so we have a great deal of confidence in that. But it's also efficiency, it's about running a plant at capacity and not having to go to the outside to buy as much boneless or skinless breast meat as we have in '21. And then labor, I mean, I mentioned earlier that we're back to near complete staffing and we're seeing some really, really good result from that. And our team is excited in terms of just the efficiency and improvement we've seen since completing our vaccine mandate on November 1st. But this comes down to execution story and volume is absolutely critical to getting us to the waypoint of 5 to 7, but also in terms of taking us into the future. And with that, let me flip it over to David. He may add a little more color to that.\nDavid Bray: Yes, just a little bit of color, Donnie. Thank you very much for the opportunity. And again, I think it is critical for us to state that volume is a critical pillar for that. But we also have a very structured success program that we built across our organization where we're focused on being the most sought-after place to work, where we're focused on servicing our customer, growing our optimal products and brands, and performing with the best. Hatch is a component of that and again we are seeing sequential week-over-week improvement and feel good about the plan that we have in place relative to the hatch. We are also working on other imperatives within our business and a lot of this really began within the Q4 timeframe. We're increasing our investment in dark meat debone capacity. There was also significant price investment -- or improvement that we realized within the quarter. And ultimately, we're optimizing our plant efficiency ahead of our increased harvest. Improvements are coming from price, mix, volume, spend, and labor. In short, we are driving operational excellence across our poultry segment and we are aligned on that plan. I will tell you we have the right plan and we have the right people to make sure that we execute on the fundamentals of our business.\nOperator: The next question will come from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nNoelle O\u2019mara: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Can I ask, first of all, about the labor cost implications for the longer-term. You're obviously spending up, presumably raising wage rates, and so on. How much do you expect the entire labor cost to be above pre -pandemic level once all the dust has settled? And then I have a follow-up.\nDonnie King: Thank you for the question. I would tell you that as we stated, we have to win with team members. We have to be the most sought after place to work, and we've done a number of things already to try to do that. It's the recognition that the workforce today, they have many options and there are a few people chasing the number of jobs that are actually out there. And so as we've talked internally, we're not trying to talk the labor problem for America, we're trying to solve it for Tyson Foods. And we want to give people an option. We want to give them a better option. And we think the key to the staffing plants, but more importantly, being able to serve it's customers and execute at high-level, absolutely starts with people. So the $24 an hour includes a number of things, but it's the benefits that go with that. We've had to enhance a number of those things, do things like scheduling different. Differences meaning multiple shifts or being very creative at each location. Childcare is a component of that. We've experimented with on-site health clinic, is another we've experimented with but we're trying to be creative and trying to make sure that we're positioned well, to have a place people want to come to work. And we see that as being critical to our future success. And so that's what we're doing, $24 an hour. I will tell you that's maybe leading in the marketplace, but it's also a competitive wage, and so we want to be on the lean side of that. And so that is our intent, that's how you can think about it as we think about labor going forward. We see that as the cost of inflation and the cost of labor going forward.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you. And just as you look out to fiscal '22, what do you see as the biggest uncertainties and risks this year? It sounds that you're fairly confident in the checking margin recovery; but across the business, what do you see is the biggest uncertainties from distance back to today.\nDonnie King: Sure. I would tell you that in all my years of being in this business, there are always rifts that come up. The one thing I am certain of is as we get into '22, we will -- there's going to be something happen, we hadn't anticipated. If you go back to this time a year ago, we thought we had a pretty solid plan around in poultry around grain pricing, or pricing relative to grain. And then we saw a tremendous increase in the cost of grain and we were sitting with a fixed pricing on so much. So, those type of things happen, but I can tell you and why we're excited, is that we've adjusted our pricing model. And so that we the derisk it, not only for us, but also for our customers. So that when there is inflation, then we are in a position. We can adjust pricing with those customers and our relationships with them are really second to none and these have been really good conversations. It's been a win-win approach in these conversations and we're proud of that. And it starts with that relationship with the customer. So we've moved and derisked our model relative to pricing and inflation and that, we believe, puts us in a better position. In terms of the labor, I don't know how to anticipate a new COVID variant or something that the vaccine might not protect against, but I can tell you that we took a bold action to do everything we knew to do to protect team members, and we saw it as an investment and a derisking of our business just by having a vaccinated workforce. And so we believe that's 1 less thing we'll have to deal with this year. That's 1 less thing we're seeing in terms of complexity to our business.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: The next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nStewart Glendinning: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: Morning. So maybe just a bit of a clarification question on the guidance as we think about what's embedded in the segment margin assumptions. Can you help us think, at the total Company level, what level of non-raw material inflation is assumed for things around logistics and labor, and packaging too in there? And as well, what is assumed on a year-on-year basis for feed costs in the Chicken segment?\nDonnie King: Thanks, Adam. I'll start with it and I'll pass it over to Stewart. He can cover, maybe, in greater detail on some of those non-grain. We've positioned ourselves from a Poultry perspective as well as from a Prepared Foods perspective so that we can respond to inflation; whether it be grain, labor, transportation, warehousing costs which are the biggest ones. Packaging, and ingredients have all gone up in price as well. In fact, I would -- it might be easier for me to tell you what hasn't -- say, what component hasn't seen inflation in this past year. But we think we've got our model positioned to adjust for that; around pricing and responsiveness, and we don't expect customers to pay for our inefficiencies. But we'd like to think that we have relationships with customers that allow us to be able to take to them part -- inflation that we see in the marketplace and be able to pass that on ultimately to the consumer. So that's the way we've thought about our model. That's how we've adjusted our model. And it's been a year along, really. A year-long event doing that. And we're in a pretty good place right now. With respect to chicken, I think based on today's current level of inflation, we have currently caught up with that inflation with pricing across the Chicken segment. We're putting that pricing in place in Prepared Foods, and of course, our commodity businesses of Beef and Pork, those respond more rapidly to inflation. And so those are working as designed as well. Stewart, would you like to add any color to that?\nStewart Glendinning: Sure, Donnie. Adam, just a couple of points to make here. So first of all, we had a question early on about the savings. That's the $300 to $400 million that's coming through as a benefit in the year. We shared with you that obviously volume is increasing, so you're going to see some increase from volume. And of course, we're continuing to pass through price and have the benefit of some mix. When you look at the top-line of the business, though, keep in mind and actually look at the costs, keep in mind the guidance around Beef, which is lower than last year, right? And for Beef, you should expect to see both crowd-out ball and you should expect to see the cattle cost increase and that's going to be part of it. A couple of other things to keep in mind, there are ingredient costs that are outside of grains. Things like cooking oils, you've seen the price of oils have increased. Distribution is up. And we've had 13 strong quarters of share gain in our Prepared Foods business. And that business will likely invest money behind our brands this year to make sure that kind of momentum continues. So that probably will run through the big guidance.\nAdam Samuelson: All right, that's really helpful. And then on the productivity, you talked about -- look, it's a bit more of a gross productivity action where you hope to capture as much as you can to the bottom-line or you choose to re-invest, but can you help frame how the scope of the spend that productivity is going after. Obviously, it wouldn't have that much impact on some of the direct raw materials in terms of the feed ingredients, or cattle, or hog that you buy. What's the right denominator to think about the scope of the savings? [Indiscernible] over a couple of years.\nStewart Glendinning: Yeah, it's complicated in our business costs because you've got all the commodity, meat inputs, so you either pull those off, but I don't know that I've got a great number to put to you to get that. What I would go back to is your starting point, which is -- that you -- we hope that this drops. Our initial -- not-a-hook strategy, actually. We have a very strong game plan, here to drive these costs to the bottom line. And they're part of our equation for next year. And you'll see that and that's part of our guidance. The shape of next year looks good. Prepared Foods and Chicken, both showing improvement, strong improvement from the fourth quarter. Beef still expecting a very strong year despite lower numbers than we had this year. So I think the shape of things looks good. Those savings are embedded in the forecast that I've given.\nDonnie King: Stewart, if I may answer or add one more thing to that. These -- every one of these savings that we've talked about over the next 3 years, we have a program management office, and we track that to the bottom line. We have built that into our '22 plan and if you look at the out years of '23 and '24, we've also built that into operating income. We did not count it unless we could show it hitting the operating income line of the business. This is -- we did -- we've done our work here to make sure this was not a sleight of hand, but a true delivering of results. And more importantly, delivering of a much, much better process all the way around.\nAdam Samuelson: I appreciate all that color. I will pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ken Zaslow with Bank of America, Montreal.\nKen Zaslow: Good morning, everyone.\nStewart Glendinning: Morning, Ken.\nDonnie King: Good morning, Ken.\nNoelle O\u2019mara: Good morning.\nKen Zaslow: Just have a couple of jobs apparently, Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, but a couple of questions. You said you cover ed -- you actually covered costs with pricing on the Chicken business as of now. Help me understand. So does that mean that the issues right now are really operational issues? And then as you move into the new year, you're going to price on top of that as your pricing contracts come to anniversary? Is that how to think about it or did I misunderstand?\nDonnie King: I think it -- Ken, thanks. I think it's probably more of a point in time. My comment was, as of today, we have our pricing at a point where it covers the cost of inflation. We've also had, during the most recent quarter, we've had issues with the labor availability and inefficiencies associated with that but we're now staffed. I've mentioned that in terms of a go-forward position. We will be fully staffed and, again, I'm speaking of Chicken here, but we will be fully staffed, we'll be far more efficient. David and his team are laser focused on the executional excellence in the business, and we're seeing great progress in there. And Noelle and her team have prepared to doing exactly the same thing. So we're optimistic going forward. We believe the worst is behind us and we're excited about what we're seeing in our Q1 and what we'll see for the year. It's very much in line with what we project.\nKen Zaslow: So just to understand that, what is for the next year or 2 is really in your control as you align more with industry on the pricing and the cost structure -- on the cost, not the cost structure, but more right now, it is internal improvements that will drive the next year or 2 versus you are now relatively capturing what the market is giving to you on the pricing versus the cost side. Is that a fair assessment?\nDonnie King: It's fair and largely accurate. Of the all thing I would add about that is in some of the more branded part of the portfolio, there's typically a lag between inflation and it's point we're able to get pricing, and we're looking constantly at ways to try to shorten that cycle with our customers. So think of that as being the differentiator there. But I would tell you much of what we have to do and the way we structured our model, executional excellence, and our call that out specifically in the script, it will be a top of mind to all of us across all businesses and functions at Tyson.\nKen Zaslow: If I could squeeze in 1 more and then I'll leave it there.\nDonnie King: Sure.\nKen Zaslow: When you put in the capital spending that you're doing, and I know we all have to think about 2022, but when we think about 2023, 2024; what do you think the returns on that would be? And does that enhance either the stability of your model or the growth algorithm of your model as you are now deploying enough capital that it's almost like an acquisition, right? You're not actually making acquisition, but you're putting enough capital there, there should be a return on that, that may be something changes in 2023, 2024. And I will leave it there and I appreciate your time.\nDonnie King: I will start with that. And Stewart may want to add something to it, but the spend that we have, the return on that invested capital, we certainly understand that we've had a few issues in delivering that over the past; but I will tell you that return on invested capital is a part of the entire leadership team's scorecard. So we're approving those dollars as spend against a demand that is known and a return that is that is known. And so we feel very confident about the returns on those businesses and we're not concerned about the fact that we're going to get a really, really good return on that investment. In fact, we think it, versus other options, is a much better return; but it's still ours to ultimately still have to execute.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Ken, just a couple of things. So first of all, we're targeting double-digit returns, and let us shape via the guidance as we move forward, so you get the timing of that right; but, I mean, we have strong returns here. In terms of the algorithm, it's going to do 2 things for us: first of all, it's bringing some of the savings, we're talking about in $300 to $400 million. It is providing a better and safer workplace for our team members. And let's not forget that there's going to be considerable expansion of capacity here, particularly in the international business on a percentage basis, so that is going to procure that future growth. We feel great about it, the numbers are big; but 1 thing about internal CapEx, you know exactly where you're putting the money. You know exactly what you're getting for.\nKen Zaslow: Great. I appreciate it, guys. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nDonnie King: Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking again soon and hope to hear from you at our Investor Day on December 9th. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stewart Glendinning",
            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary about total Company financial results. We're pleased to report a strong overall finish to the year. Sales were up approximately 20 % in the fourth quarter, largely a function of our successful pricing initiatives that were pursued to offset inflationary pressures. Volumes were down 4 % during the fourth quarter, primarily due to labor challenges, hampering our efforts to fully benefit from strong retail demand and recovery in food service. Fourth quarter operating income of nearly $1.2 billion was up 26 % due to continued strong performance in our beef business. For the full year, operating income improved in nearly $4.3 billion up 42 %. Driven by the strength in operating income, fourth-quarter EPS grew 35 % to $2.30 with the full-year up 53 % to $8.28. Slide 11 bridges our total Company sales for fiscal year '21. Sales dollars were up across all segments. As you can see, the most substantial sales dollars benefit came from the Beef segment, which saw market conditions that led to a wider than historical cutout margin. At the same time, we saw price increases across the business to offset the high levels of inflation we faced. Looking at our channel results, sales at retail drove over $1 billion of top-line improvement versus last year, even after exceptionally strong volumes in the comparable period. Improvements in sales through the food service channel drove an increase of $1.6 billion and our fiscal year export sales were nearly $1 billion stronger than the prior year. As we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. Slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was about $1.3 billion higher than fiscal 2020. As I mentioned previously, volumes were down slightly during the year, primarily a result of a challenging labor environment. Our pricing actions and strength in the Beef segment led to approximately $5.6 billion of sales price mix benefit, which more than offset the higher COGS price mix of $4.6 billion. We saw inflation across the business. Notable areas were in wages, grain costs, live animal costs, and pork, meat cost, and prepared foods, and freight costs across the enterprise. Incremental direct COVID-19 costs were favorable by approximately $200 million during the year. Also, our total spending at $335 million was still substantial. The decrease was driven primarily by cycling one-time bonuses that were paid last year. And a large portion of that was reinvested in permanent wage increases for our team members this year. Lower one-time bonus costs were partially offset by higher testing and vaccination costs incurred during fiscal 2021. While these costs are expected to reduce in fiscal '22, we will continue to spend against initiatives to keep our team members safe. And finally, SG&A was over $100 million [Indiscernible] to prior year, which was largely a result of a net benefit associated with the beef supplier fraud. Now, moving to the beef segment. Segment and sales were over $5 billion for the quarter up 26 % versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products. Offsetting higher sales prices were higher cattle costs up more than 20 % during the fourth quarter. We had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. And we have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs. Sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago, driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion or 22.9% for the fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. While our Beef segment experienced strong results during the quarter and fiscal year, we're still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput due to labor challenges, which we expect to normalize over the course of fiscal '22. Now, let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 14. Segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 30 % versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased more than 40 %. Our volumes were down relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $78 million for the quarter down 52 % versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined to 4.7% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 7 % relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down 5.7% in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in food service more than offset by labor challenges. Sales growth outpaced volume growth, driven by inflation justified pricing and better sales mix. During the fourth quarter, retail core business lines experienced the 13th straight quarter of volume share growth driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong brand execution by our team. Operating margins for the segment were 1.7% or $39 million for the fourth quarter. A slowdown in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw material input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter. For the full-year, operating income margin was 7.6% or $672 million. As we mentioned last quarter, the ongoing inflationary environment created a meaningful headwind for Prepared Foods during the fourth quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging, and labor have increased our cost of production. We've executed pricing, revenue management, and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. We expect to take continued pricing actions to ensure that any inflationary cost increases that our business incurs are passed along. Our pricing has lagged inflation, but we expect to recover those cost increases during fiscal '22. Moving into the Chicken segment's results, sales were $3.9 billion for the fourth quarter, up 21 %. Volumes improved 1.3% in the quarter. has strong consumer demand offset both labor challenges and the detrimental impact of a fire at our hands build rendering facility. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes, and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal '22 as the hatch rate recovers, and we operate our plants more efficiently. Average sales price improved over 20 % in the fourth quarter and 11.4% for the fiscal year compared to the same periods last year. This increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation. Our pricing has admittedly lagged our realization of cost inflation, but we made tremendous progress in the last few months to close that gap and are now seeing those benefits. We have restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal '21 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions. Chicken experienced an operating loss of $113 million in the fourth quarter. The segment earned $24 million representing an operating margin of 0.2% for the fiscal year 2021. Operating income was negatively impacted by $945 million of higher feed ingredient costs, grow out expenses, and outside meat purchases. For the fourth quarter, feed ingredients with $325 million higher than the same period last year. Segment performance also reflects net derivative losses of $75 million during the fourth quarter, which was a $120 million worse than the same period last year. Turning to Slide 17. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially delivered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.2 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA as we paid down $2 billion of debt while growing our earnings and cash flow. Investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. Each of these leaders will support strong return generation for our shareholders. We will also continue to explore parts to optimize our portfolio through M&A, through the lens of the value creation and shareholder return. Finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We're pleased to announce that last week our board approved a $0.06 increase to our annual dividend payment, now totaling $1.84 per Class A share. Let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. We currently anticipate total Company sales between $49 billion and $51 billion, which translate to sales growth of between 5 % and 7 %. We expect 2 % to 3 % volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full. Our new productivity initiatives is expected to deliver $300 to $400 million of savings during fiscal '22, driven by operational and functional excellence initiatives. The roll-out of digital solutions across the enterprise and extensive automation projects that are currently underway. Now, as we look at the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect a meaningful increase in CapEx spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles. We currently anticipate CapEx spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal '22, an increase of roughly $800 million. This investment will support our initiatives to meet global protein demand growth into the future, allow us to gain share and will deliver strong financial returns for our shareholders. Excluding the impact of changes from potential tax legislation, we currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23 %. We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $380 million because of intentional deleveraging during fiscal '21. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our target while net leverage is expected to remain well below 2 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. It is important to note though that over the last 2 years, working capital has been a source of cash. We don't expect this to be the case in fiscal '22. Moving forward, our business growth where we require increased working capital, which combined with deferred tax payments under the CARES Act, taxes on the gain of the pet treats divestiture, litigation settlements, and other discrete items will lead to a substantial use of cash during fiscal 2022. Now, let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to that total Company performance. Prepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7 % and 9 %. We will remain disciplined and agile in our pricing initiatives to ensure that any additional inflationary pressures are passed along to customers, while also working diligently to deliver productivity savings to reduce costs. We expect the Beef segment to continue to show strength due to prolonged industry dynamics, leading to segment margins of between 9 % and 11 %. We expect the front half for the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year. In chicken, our operational turnaround is working, and we still expect to achieve run-rate profitability of 5 % to 7 % by the middle of the year. We expect this will be achieved through sequential quarterly margin improvements during the first half of the year, resulting in full-year margins that fall between 5 % to 7 % of our expected at the lower end of that range. In pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21, equating to a margin of between 5 % and 7 %. In International and other, we expect margins of 2 % to 3 % as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability. Our segments individually and an aggregate have clear in compelling role within Tyson's portfolio strategy. They deliver diverse counter cyclical performance that supports the Company's long-term earnings objectives and delivers strong value for shareholders. I will now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&A instructions. Megan? Morning. Ben, good morning, Stewart here. Look, we're trying to drive for as much of it as possible to the bottom line, but keep in mind that our assumptions around what's going to drop to the bottom line are already embedded in the guidance that we've given you by segment, but that's the short story. Okay. Right. Let me unpack that a little bit -- yes. Look, we're super pleased with the way the year has worked out. This is really a diverse portfolio that's delivered a great result and that's driven the increase in cash. So sitting at 1.2 times leverage, we've got $1 billion of debt that will come through this year. We're planning to pay that down. We also, as you called out, are going to have a much larger expenditure on CapEx, which is going to be great for our investors. And as our business grows, that's going to consume some more working capital -- regular working capital. In addition to that, we've got a number of one-off payments that we expect to pay out this year, which are pretty meaningful. And to characterize that as around a billion dollars of deferred taxes related to the CARES Act, taxes that are owed on the sale of the pet business, as well as some payout of the litigation accruals that you've seen in our books. To M&A, maybe the last question on an M&A versus buyback. Look, it's a normal course. We don't comment on any specific M&A, but we've shared the levers in our business. We have successfully pulled all those levers over the last number of years, and I think that's been a good effect. We don't imagine that we're going to change that this year. Thank you. Morning, Peter. Good morning. Sure, Donnie. Adam, just a couple of points to make here. So first of all, we had a question early on about the savings. That's the $300 to $400 million that's coming through as a benefit in the year. We shared with you that obviously volume is increasing, so you're going to see some increase from volume. And of course, we're continuing to pass through price and have the benefit of some mix. When you look at the top-line of the business, though, keep in mind and actually look at the costs, keep in mind the guidance around Beef, which is lower than last year, right? And for Beef, you should expect to see both crowd-out ball and you should expect to see the cattle cost increase and that's going to be part of it. A couple of other things to keep in mind, there are ingredient costs that are outside of grains. Things like cooking oils, you've seen the price of oils have increased. Distribution is up. And we've had 13 strong quarters of share gain in our Prepared Foods business. And that business will likely invest money behind our brands this year to make sure that kind of momentum continues. So that probably will run through the big guidance. Yeah, it's complicated in our business costs because you've got all the commodity, meat inputs, so you either pull those off, but I don't know that I've got a great number to put to you to get that. What I would go back to is your starting point, which is -- that you -- we hope that this drops. Our initial -- not-a-hook strategy, actually. We have a very strong game plan, here to drive these costs to the bottom line. And they're part of our equation for next year. And you'll see that and that's part of our guidance. The shape of next year looks good. Prepared Foods and Chicken, both showing improvement, strong improvement from the fourth quarter. Beef still expecting a very strong year despite lower numbers than we had this year. So I think the shape of things looks good. Those savings are embedded in the forecast that I've given. Morning, Ken. Yes. Ken, just a couple of things. So first of all, we're targeting double-digit returns, and let us shape via the guidance as we move forward, so you get the timing of that right; but, I mean, we have strong returns here. In terms of the algorithm, it's going to do 2 things for us: first of all, it's bringing some of the savings, we're talking about in $300 to $400 million.

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan. I'll start by saying that the safety of our team members continue to be our top priority, and I'm very pleased that we now have a team in the U.S. that is fully vaccinated. As we focus on meeting the needs of our customers and consumers, vaccination is the best way that we can protect our team members from the impacts related to COVID-19 and ensure business continuity. Earlier today, we reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. We delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth in a challenging year. Our performance was supported by continued strength in consumer demand for protein. Our retail core business lines which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park have driven strong share growth in the retail channel, delivering 13 quarters of consecutive growth. Continued recovery in the food service channel led by QSRs, also supported our strong results. Overall, we saw our volume recovery in the second half from the pandemic lows to finish the fiscal year only slightly down. We are taking several deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes including investing behind capacities, brand, and product innovation, and our team members. Our investments in team members include our successful vaccination mandate as well as automation and technology initiatives that I'll discuss in a moment. The construction of the 12 new plants that we've mentioned previously are progressing well, and once complete, will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and growing global demand for protein. These new capacities include 9 chicken plants, 2 case-ready beef and pork plants, and 1 new bacon plant. In parallel to our actions to improve volume, we have also worked to recover inflation through pricing, achieving a 13 % price improvement for the fiscal year and a 24 % increase for the fourth quarter. In this dynamic environment, we will be aggressive in monitoring inflation and driving price recovery activities. And the diversity of our portfolio showed its value again this quarter as demonstrated by earnings performance in our beef segment supported the delivery of a strong fiscal year earnings results. Our performance has allowed us to build financial strength. Our Balance Sheet is strong, resilient, and provides Tyson the optionality needed to pursue strategic growth priorities. And to that point, our investment in future growth across our portfolio continue. We demonstrated resilience in fiscal year 2021, and we are entering fiscal 2022 with tremendous momentum. Our results demonstrate the dedication of our global team, the importance of our diverse portfolio strategy, and our ability to meet consumer demand across proteins, channels, and meal occasions. Now turning to financial results, let me give you some highlights overall. I was pleased with both a strong quarter and full-year. Sales improved 20 % in the fourth quarter and 11 % during the full year. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price. Average sales price trends reflect successful pricing strategies during the ongoing inflationary environment, but we still have opportunities specifically in prepared foods, where we delivered softer results than anticipated. Like many other companies, we were faced with a range of higher levels of inflation; notably higher grains, labor, meat, and transportation costs. Our teams have worked together with our customers to pass along that inflation through price increases. On volume, we saw improvement in the second half relative to the same period last year. Volumes were up 3 % for the second half or nearly 350 million pounds. Although we're working diligently to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and ability to achieve optimal mix across our processing footprint. Having said that, we're taking aggressive actions as a team to address the labor constraints, and we're seeing improvement. We delivered solid operating income performance, up 26 % during the fourth quarter and 42 % for the full year. This performance was largely due to strength in our beef segment, where continued strong consumer demand and ample cattle supply have driven higher earnings. Overall, our operating income performance translated to earnings per share of $2.30 for the fourth quarter, up 35 %, and $8.28 for the full year, up 53 %. Looking at our results on volume. We're taking aggressive actions to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. For the fiscal year, our volume was down slightly. Customer demand during the fiscal '21 outpaced our ability to supply products, but we're working aggressively to fill that void. We recognize how important service levels are to our customers, and we're committed to improving our fill rates and reliability of supply. With respect to supply, we have focused on ensuring our ability to maintain business continuity, and our team has been resilient in the face of numerous supply chain challenges. As we look towards fiscal '22, improving volumes will be key to delivering against our commitments. We expect to grow our total Company volumes by 2% to 3% next year, outpacing overall protein consumption growth. A large percentage of that growth will come from the chicken segment. And across our business, we're working to optimize our product portfolio, remove complexities, enhance capacities, and pursue operational improvement initiatives to deliver against these volume growth objectives. Moving now to Slide 6, we acknowledge the challenging and competitive labor environment, and it's no secret that we want to be the most sought after place to work. We fully understand that this starts with an unrelenting focus on safety every minute, every shift, every day. The health, safety, and wellness of our team members has been and will continue to be our top priority. So, I'd like to take a minute to stop and commend our team members and our leadership team for doing their part to keep themselves, their colleagues, their families, and their communities safe, which has helped us reach our vaccination goals. But vaccines and investments in COVID-19 protection measures are certainly not the only actions that we've taken to become the most sought after place to work. To ensure that every Tyson team member feels as though they can bring their true and complete self to work each day, we've invested behind diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. And we also understand the importance of a strong compensation offering, and we believe that we hold a leadership position in this space. We have raised wages and across our business today, we pay an average of $24 per hour, which includes full medical, vision, dental, and other benefits like access to retirement plan and sick pay, and we will continue to explore other innovative benefit offerings that remove barriers and make our team members lives easier. We're also accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make existing roles safer and easier while reducing cost. We're confident that our actions will increase Tyson's staffing levels and position us for volume growth. Relating to operational excellence and market competitiveness, today, we are announcing the launch of a new productivity program, designed to drive a better, faster, and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The program is targeted to deliver 1 billion in recurring productivity savings of the end of fiscal '24 relative to fiscal 2021 cost baseline. These savings are included in the guidance expectations as Stewart will share in a moment. Execution of the effort will be supported by a program management office that will ensure delivery of key project milestones and report on savings achievements connected to 3 imperatives. The first is operational and functional excellence and is targeted to deliver greater than $300 million in recurring savings. This includes functional efficiency efforts in finance, HR, and procurement that are focused on applying best practices to reduce cost. The second is digital solutions, which is targeted to deliver more than $250 million in recurring savings. We'll achieve this goal by leveraging new digital solutions like artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to drive efficiency and operations, supply chain planning, logistics, and warehousing. For example, we're using technology to ensure that our shipments are optimally loaded to say freight costs and enhance customer service levels. In many ways, the pandemic has already accelerated our push to more digital footing and our commitment in this space will continue that focus. The third is automation. We will leverage automation and robotics technologies to automate difficult and higher turnover positions. For example, we have substantial opportunity to automate the deboned process within our poultry harvest facilities using a combination of both third-party and proprietary technologies. Chicken remains a top priority for me personally and for our Company. We continue to execute against our roadmap to bring operating income margin to at least the 5 % to 7 % range on a run rate basis by mid fiscal '22. Our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. The first imperative is to be the most sought after place to work. I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. This will ensure that we have the right levels of staffing to fulfill our customer orders on time and in full. The second imperative is to improve operational performance. Critical to improving operational performance is maximizing our fixed cost of leverage, which means having enough birds in our internal networks to run our plants full. Reconfiguring and optimizing our existing footprint, we can increase our harvest capacity by more than 10 % without building another plant. In addition, we have clear initiatives to remove complexity from our plants, reduce transportation and handling, and minimize waste. Our operational improvements will unlock significant unused capacity in our network and take advantage of the fixed cost leverage. Each of these initiatives will support leading operational performance from our chicken business in the future. Patch rates have impacted our ability to do this, and we've shared the initiatives underway to correct this. Our new mail roll-out is progressing as planned, and we believe we've hit the inflection point that will lead to sequential improvements through the entirety of fiscal 2022. The new mail roll-out at our pullet farms is nearly complete, and we continue to observe improved hatch rates associated with these new mails. We've also mentioned how strengthened spot prices for commodity chicken products throughout the fiscal year has put our buy-versus-grow program at a relative disadvantage versus history. From Q3 to Q4, we again reduced our rate of outside purchases, this time by nearly 30 %. The final imperative is to service our customers, on time and in full. Tyson's branded value-added product offerings have continued to gain share during both the fourth quarter and the latest 52 weeks and new capacity expansions will help us maintain momentum. Inflation has clearly had an impact on the business. Our commercial teams have successfully pursued inflation justified pricing, delivering top-line growth for the business to offset the cost increases. As rates of inflation continue, so will our pricing actions. Whether in equivalent level of emphasis on disciplined operational execution and volume throughput. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow volumes, and be the best chicken business. The plan we have in place is still the right plan, and our level of confidence, conviction, and excitement as the team continue to grow. Looking forward to fiscal year 2022, I feel confident our ability to drive value creation. We have strong consumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels, and a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. Our priorities are clear. Winning with customers and consumers, winning with team members, and winning with excellence in execution. With these priorities as our guide, we're taking aggressive actions to accelerate our growth relative to the overall market, improve operating margins, and drive stronger returns on invested capital. We are committed to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety, and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment every shift, every day, every location, with no exceptions. We have shown that we are willing to take bold actions in support of this commitment. Second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better serve demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales, by focusing our product portfolio and by adding capacity to meet demand. We expect our volume to outpace the market in the intermediate term. Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our check-in segment. This starts by returning our operating margin to the 5 % to 7 % level by the middle of fiscal 2022. Fourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence, and investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our new productivity program. We are working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy, enhanced decision-making speed across the organization. Finally, to address expected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business through both organic investments and strategic M&A. On capital alone, we expect to invest $2 billion in fiscal year 2022 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. Tyson has the right portfolio, the consumer-driven insight, and the scale and the capabilities to win in the marketplace across proteins, channels and meal occasions. We also have the financial strength to invest behind our business to accelerate growth and to maintain our momentum. I look forward to sharing with you our progress as we work through the year, and I'll be sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in a few weeks. I will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail. Morning. Thank you. Good morning. Let me take that, Stewart, and good morning. Labor has been very challenging throughout the year, but as we've mentioned in the script earlier, we're seeing a light at the end of this tunnel. We're seeing our ability to get plant staffed, -- I think from a poultry perspective. For example, we're almost fully staffed since November 1, we've made great progress across Prepared Foods and our beef and pork businesses, so we're gaining on that post the close of our vaccine mandate. So we're very optimistic about '22. But in addition to having a labor shortfall, which is constrained capacity, we've also had just capacity shortfall in some key categories. For example, ready-to-eat products that would be for the more value-added poultry and also for Prepared Foods. And again, we're just now bringing on 2 new case-ready beef and pork plants to enable us to have more capacity in there in a startup mode. So yes, labor has been a challenge. We're seeing progress. We're very excited about '22 from that perspective. We believe we've got the worst behind us and we're looking forward to that, but we're also -- we got 12 new plants going or under construction to deliver more capacity, and we have strong demand for that. And so, we look forward to what that will deliver for us not only this year, but also in the coming years. Hi, Ben. I'll make a couple of comments and I'll pass that onto our expert, Noelle O'mara, who leads our Prepared Foods businesses. And so it's -- you'd characterize much of it. We're trying to absorb the rapid inflation, predominantly in pork products and meat. And as we go with this branded portfolio that we have to the marketplace, it's no different than any other CPHE (ph) Company has dealt with. You're trying to balance share and price, and it takes a little bit of time, unlike the commodity portion of our business, say beef and pork, and takes a little more time to get that executed. We're looking for ways, always looking for ways to try to expedite that process but it takes a bit to be able to get customers aligned, to be able to get promotional and those activities aligned. But let me stop with that and I'll toss it over to Noelle to add some color as well. Thank you. Good morning. Well, let me start. Peter was saying, it applies to all segments and the first part of the program has to do with operational and functional excellence. And quite frankly, that is really doing our jobs better, taking out ways to removing bureaucracy. And that's primarily targeted against our finance, human resources, and procurement groups; is executing at a much higher level. There's another component that is digital solutions and that's about $250 million in recurring savings. That's more on the operational side, that supply chain planning, logistics, and warehousing, so you can think of that in that bucket, and that's across all businesses. In fact, the first 2 are across all businesses. And then third, automation, leveraging robotics and technology and we're spending a significant portion of the $2 billion in capital that we're spending. A disproportionate amount of that is going against capacity expansion in these 12 plants that we talked about over the next 3 years. But, in addition to that, it's to put automation and technology and to eliminate difficult, higher turnover jobs. Take, for example, debone automation, whether it be for the white meat or dark meat. Think about in terms of material handling and you would see more of that in our Prepared Foods group. And then you've got -- if we think about outside the U.S. then we just have a -- I'd say a plethora of automation and technology, and a digital footprint as we build those plants up outside of the U.S. Great question. Let me -- I'll start out and then give you some very top-line stuff and I'll flip it over to David Bray who leads our Poultry group. Think of this in terms of the 5 % to 7 % being a waypoint and we've communicated that we think by the middle part of '22 that that's where we will be. That's not the goal, that's the waypoint, and we backed into that. But if you think about those building blocks that are necessary to get there and beyond, it's really starting with volume. And we've talked a lot about the hatch issue that we've had in the male and as we move into '22, we're already seeing great results. Remember this male that we put in is not new to the world, it's 1 we've used and delivered great results for years, so we have a great deal of confidence in that. But it's also efficiency, it's about running a plant at capacity and not having to go to the outside to buy as much boneless or skinless breast meat as we have in '21. And then labor, I mean, I mentioned earlier that we're back to near complete staffing and we're seeing some really, really good result from that. And our team is excited in terms of just the efficiency and improvement we've seen since completing our vaccine mandate on November 1st. But this comes down to execution story and volume is absolutely critical to getting us to the waypoint of 5 to 7, but also in terms of taking us into the future. And with that, let me flip it over to David. He may add a little more color to that. Good morning. Thank you for the question. I would tell you that as we stated, we have to win with team members. We have to be the most sought after place to work, and we've done a number of things already to try to do that. It's the recognition that the workforce today, they have many options and there are a few people chasing the number of jobs that are actually out there. And so as we've talked internally, we're not trying to talk the labor problem for America, we're trying to solve it for Tyson Foods. And we want to give people an option. We want to give them a better option. And we think the key to the staffing plants, but more importantly, being able to serve it's customers and execute at high-level, absolutely starts with people. So the $24 an hour includes a number of things, but it's the benefits that go with that. We've had to enhance a number of those things, do things like scheduling different. Differences meaning multiple shifts or being very creative at each location. Childcare is a component of that. We've experimented with on-site health clinic, is another we've experimented with but we're trying to be creative and trying to make sure that we're positioned well, to have a place people want to come to work. And we see that as being critical to our future success. And so that's what we're doing, $24 an hour. I will tell you that's maybe leading in the marketplace, but it's also a competitive wage, and so we want to be on the lean side of that. And so that is our intent, that's how you can think about it as we think about labor going forward. We see that as the cost of inflation and the cost of labor going forward. Sure. I would tell you that in all my years of being in this business, there are always rifts that come up. The one thing I am certain of is as we get into '22, we will -- there's going to be something happen, we hadn't anticipated. If you go back to this time a year ago, we thought we had a pretty solid plan around in poultry around grain pricing, or pricing relative to grain. And then we saw a tremendous increase in the cost of grain and we were sitting with a fixed pricing on so much. So, those type of things happen, but I can tell you and why we're excited, is that we've adjusted our pricing model. And so that we the derisk it, not only for us, but also for our customers. So that when there is inflation, then we are in a position. We can adjust pricing with those customers and our relationships with them are really second to none and these have been really good conversations. It's been a win-win approach in these conversations and we're proud of that. And it starts with that relationship with the customer. So we've moved and derisked our model relative to pricing and inflation and that, we believe, puts us in a better position. In terms of the labor, I don't know how to anticipate a new COVID variant or something that the vaccine might not protect against, but I can tell you that we took a bold action to do everything we knew to do to protect team members, and we saw it as an investment and a derisking of our business just by having a vaccinated workforce. And so we believe that's 1 less thing we'll have to deal with this year. That's 1 less thing we're seeing in terms of complexity to our business. Good morning. Thanks, Adam. I'll start with it and I'll pass it over to Stewart. He can cover, maybe, in greater detail on some of those non-grain. We've positioned ourselves from a Poultry perspective as well as from a Prepared Foods perspective so that we can respond to inflation; whether it be grain, labor, transportation, warehousing costs which are the biggest ones. Packaging, and ingredients have all gone up in price as well. In fact, I would -- it might be easier for me to tell you what hasn't -- say, what component hasn't seen inflation in this past year. But we think we've got our model positioned to adjust for that; around pricing and responsiveness, and we don't expect customers to pay for our inefficiencies. But we'd like to think that we have relationships with customers that allow us to be able to take to them part -- inflation that we see in the marketplace and be able to pass that on ultimately to the consumer. So that's the way we've thought about our model. That's how we've adjusted our model. And it's been a year along, really. A year-long event doing that. And we're in a pretty good place right now. With respect to chicken, I think based on today's current level of inflation, we have currently caught up with that inflation with pricing across the Chicken segment. We're putting that pricing in place in Prepared Foods, and of course, our commodity businesses of Beef and Pork, those respond more rapidly to inflation. And so those are working as designed as well. Stewart, would you like to add any color to that? Stewart, if I may answer or add one more thing to that. These -- every one of these savings that we've talked about over the next 3 years, we have a program management office, and we track that to the bottom line. We have built that into our '22 plan and if you look at the out years of '23 and '24, we've also built that into operating income. We did not count it unless we could show it hitting the operating income line of the business. This is -- we did -- we've done our work here to make sure this was not a sleight of hand, but a true delivering of results. And more importantly, delivering of a much, much better process all the way around. Good morning, Ken. I think it -- Ken, thanks. I think it's probably more of a point in time. My comment was, as of today, we have our pricing at a point where it covers the cost of inflation. We've also had, during the most recent quarter, we've had issues with the labor availability and inefficiencies associated with that but we're now staffed. I've mentioned that in terms of a go-forward position. We will be fully staffed and, again, I'm speaking of Chicken here, but we will be fully staffed, we'll be far more efficient. David and his team are laser focused on the executional excellence in the business, and we're seeing great progress in there. And Noelle and her team have prepared to doing exactly the same thing. So we're optimistic going forward. We believe the worst is behind us and we're excited about what we're seeing in our Q1 and what we'll see for the year. It's very much in line with what we project. It's fair and largely accurate. Of the all thing I would add about that is in some of the more branded part of the portfolio, there's typically a lag between inflation and it's point we're able to get pricing, and we're looking constantly at ways to try to shorten that cycle with our customers. So think of that as being the differentiator there. But I would tell you much of what we have to do and the way we structured our model, executional excellence, and our call that out specifically in the script, it will be a top of mind to all of us across all businesses and functions at Tyson. Sure. I will start with that. And Stewart may want to add something to it, but the spend that we have, the return on that invested capital, we certainly understand that we've had a few issues in delivering that over the past; but I will tell you that return on invested capital is a part of the entire leadership team's scorecard. So we're approving those dollars as spend against a demand that is known and a return that is that is known. And so we feel very confident about the returns on those businesses and we're not concerned about the fact that we're going to get a really, really good return on that investment. In fact, we think it, versus other options, is a much better return; but it's still ours to ultimately still have to execute. Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking again soon and hope to hear from you at our Investor Day on December 9th. Have a great day."

            "content": "Yes, just a little bit of color, Donnie. Thank you very much for the opportunity. And again, I think it is critical for us to state that volume is a critical pillar for that. But we also have a very structured success program that we built across our organization where we're focused on being the most sought-after place to work, where we're focused on servicing our customer, growing our optimal products and brands, and performing with the best. Hatch is a component of that and again we are seeing sequential week-over-week improvement and feel good about the plan that we have in place relative to the hatch. We are also working on other imperatives within our business and a lot of this really began within the Q4 timeframe. We're increasing our investment in dark meat debone capacity. There was also significant price investment -- or improvement that we realized within the quarter. And ultimately, we're optimizing our plant efficiency ahead of our increased harvest. Improvements are coming from price, mix, volume, spend, and labor. In short, we are driving operational excellence across our poultry segment and we are aligned on that plan. I will tell you we have the right plan and we have the right people to make sure that we execute on the fundamentals of our business."

Our Q4 performance was impacted because of the inflationary environment accelerating faster than anticipated. Despite the unprecedented inflationary headwinds, the actions that we took in the second half of '21 and the beginning here of '22, I expect will allow us to offset the headwinds and drive sequential improvements in profitability. Let me take that. Demand continues to be strong across the portfolio on both retail and food service. We're pleased with the market performance we're seeing despite the price increases. Elasticity has been less than historical models would've predicted. We're seeing penetration in buy-rate increases versus pre - COVID, levels across categories, as Donnie referenced. We've had our 13th consecutive quarter of share growth, but we'll continue to learn and adapt as more landscape as all. Good morning. Good morning."

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thank you Megan.  As many of you know, I\u2019ve been a Tyson team member for close to four decades, and in that time I\u2019ve led every business segment. We\u2019ve always believed in our mission and the vision of John W. Tyson, who founded this company nearly a century ago because he wanted to find a better way to feed a growing country. Today on my first earnings call as CEO, I am incredibly proud to stand alongside our team members to continue that legacy. It\u2019s an interesting time to be in this industry and we have a leadership team that together can capitalize on the strengths of this company and the opportunities ahead.  Let\u2019s begin with a view of our overall performance this quarter. First, our retail performance - 12 consecutive quarters of retail share gains in our core business line is driven by strength of our brands along with solid execution from our team. We are in a market that has demonstrated strong demand for protein and people are reaching most for brands they trust. Our billion-dollar brands - Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farms have driven strong share growth with consumers buying more than ever before.  Second, we saw in the third quarter growing volume in food service channels as reopening and recovery continues. We saw uptick from outlets nationwide reflected in our sales, which we were up $1.3 billion for the quarter. Our broad production and distribution network is well positioned to meet this growing demand.  Third, the diversity of our portfolio demonstrated its value during the quarter. Led by beef, we delivered an exceptional result as strong U.S. and export demand coupled with ample cattle supply supported elevated margins in that business.  Fourth, we continue to build financial strength. This quarter, we used higher operating cash flow to reduce debt. The steps we\u2019ve taken position us with a very strong balance sheet and high levels of liquidity. Finally, we are investing in future growth across our portfolio. We\u2019re in the process of bringing 12 new plants online globally to address capacity constraints and growing demand.  In all, Tyson delivered a strong quarter. As we look to the future, we want to build on these strengths. Let\u2019s look at how we plan to do that. First, we have built a solid footing to drive consistent results. Our strengths include a diverse portfolio, well known, trusted brands, scale in meaningful markets, and an exceptionally strong balance sheet.  Second, labor is our number one challenge, so we have continued our focus on improving our team member experience without compromising their health and safety. We are accelerating efforts to make Tyson the most sought after place to work because we know how important team members are to our business. One of the ways we\u2019re doing this is to accelerate our investments in automation and technology. This not only helps us to eliminate more difficult, hard to fill tasks, but also re-skills our labor profile to enable their contributions to more value-added activities. Third, we are actively working to recover volume from pandemic lows and in doing so improve the reliability we offer our customers. Dynamic and evolving channel demand continues to create operational complexity. We took steps earlier this year to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and to accelerate our speed to market by getting our sales teams closer to their customers. There is more to do, however, and so our work here continues. Fourth, our focus on operational excellence and disciplined cost management is especially important during periods of continued market volatility and increasing inflationary pressures. As you will hear today, we continue to be laser focused in making progress in restoring the competitiveness of our chicken segment. We are also accelerating actions across our enterprise to become more operationally excellent. Finally, we will continue to optimize our balance sheet which will give us optionality as we prioritize the delivery of shareholder value.  Turning to Slide 5, we improved our sales and earnings performance this quarter. The results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-protein, multi-channel portfolio. Sales improved 25% in third quarter and 8% year to date, reflecting the improved volumes which are up 10% for the quarter and flat year-to-date. It also reflects effective pricing strategies in all of our segments during this inflationary environment.  We delivered strong operating earnings performance resulting in approximately $1.4 billion in operating income for the quarter. This represents an 81% increase compared to prior year and translates to $2.70 in earnings per share. Our earnings reflect our three key priorities: one, to be the go-to supplier for customers and consumers; two, to be the most sought after place to work; and three, to be operationally excellent.  We want to be the most sought after place to work. This starts with an unrelenting focus on safety every minute, every shift, every day. Health and safety have been and will continue to be our top priority. We have a history of using all the tools at our disposal to protect our team members, and the vaccine is no different. As many of you will have seen, last week we announced that Tyson will require COVID-19 vaccinations for our entire U.S. workforce by November 1. We do this now because the delta variant is more contagious and getting vaccinated is the single most effective thing people can do to protect themselves, their families and their communities. We have raised wages in many markets to ensure we\u2019re competitive and are exploring other ways to make Tyson the most sought after place to work in the communities where we operate. For example, we are piloting childcare facilities at some of our plants and we have opened medical clinics to make healthcare more accessible to team members and their families. Finally, we are accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make the team members\u2019 jobs easier. We look forward to providing more detail on our automation and technology road map at our upcoming investor day. We\u2019re taking aggressive actions to add new capacity to meet demand, adjust our product mix by plant, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. We are listening to our customers and are committed to improving reliability of supply.  In the third quarter, we improved volume levels across all segments. In prepared foods, we continued to optimize our product portfolio, remove processing and supply chain complexity, and prioritize products with the highest demand, resulting in lower cost and better service to our customers. In beef, ample cattle supply, heavier animal weights and strong demand have driven volumes higher year to date. In pork, our volumes are up year to date versus pandemic lows. We are pleased to have additional capacity coming online at Eagle Mountain, Utah and Columbia, South Carolina. Both facilities are expected to grow our prepackaged beef and pork products. In chicken, volume declined year to date despite improved food service demand led by QSRs. We also saw sustained retail demand, including the frozen value-added poultry category. Limited capacity and persistent labor challenges have impacted customer fill rates in this segment; however, our new plant in Humboldt, Tennessee continues to ramp up production, including harvest capacity. This ramp-up is helping us improve customer fill rates. Chicken remains a top priority for me and for our company. We continue to execute against our road map to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range by mid fiscal \u201922. Our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top tier performance. We are making progress. The first imperative is to be the most sought after place to work. I\u2019ve outlined the investments we\u2019re making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments.  The second imperative is to improve operational performance. Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of lower hatch rates on our chicken operations. We have begun to deploy new male parent stock. Where this stock has been deployed, hatch rates are improving. We expect the full roll-out of this breeder stock to be complete this fall with harvest capacity improvements occurring by mid fiscal \u201922.  Our rate of outside meat purchases has declined 25% versus last quarter and will continue to decline as hatch rates and utilization improve. We have identified opportunities to reduce mix complexity across our chicken footprint, which will help us operate more efficiently. The final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. We\u2019re pleased by the continued share performance of our value-added products like Tyson chicken nuggets, crispy strips and air fried. We gained share during the third quarter and the last 52 weeks. Looking ahead, we expect further growth and as a result, we\u2019re investing in line upgrades and increased capacity to drive branded product growth.  We have increased prices to help offset significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. Pricing improved nearly 16% in the quarter versus the comparable period last year. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our business, and be the best chicken company, period. Part of being customer-centric means being as efficient as possible in taking costs out where you can without compromising our ability to execute against our strategic and operational priorities. We have ongoing efforts across the business to reduce costs, but we must also find new, innovative ways to be better and stronger. This means investing in advances like automation and artificial intelligence to deliver productivity gains and competitive advantage. We have already delivered strong productivity gains in fiscal year \u201921. Across our business, we are looking to build upon the strength of those actions in the months and years to come, which we will detail at the investor day later this year. These improvements come at a time when we are investing heavily in capacity expansions across segments to better with our partners and meet long term demand.  I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail.\nStewart Glendinning: Thank you Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. Sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter. Volumes were up 9.7% primarily due to strength in retail and the ongoing food service recovery. Average sales price was also up about 17% largely due to strong results in our beef segment, the mix benefit from retail volume, and the partial recovery of raw material inflation in net sales price.  Operating income was up 81% in the third quarter due to continued strong performance in our beef business. Chicken and prepared foods also improved their respective segment earnings, while pork earnings were down versus the comparable period a year ago.  Year to date operating income for the total company improved by 49%. Earnings per share grew 93% in the third quarter due largely to strength in operating income, specifically within our beef segment. EPS was up 61% on a year-to-date basis. We performed well despite a challenging operating environment that spanned tough labor availability, significant inflationary pressures on raw material costs, global supply chain challenges, and an evolving demand backdrop.  Slide 11 bridges our total company sales on a year-to-date basis. We delivered growth in the retail channel along all reporting segments which, in aggregate, accounted for more than $1 billion in sales improvement over the year-to-date period and more than $300 million in the third quarter versus the respective comparable periods.  Moving to food service, sales improved by approximately $1.3 billion in the third quarter, leading to a year-to-date improvement for the channel of nearly $1 billion compared to the same period last year. Exports were up over 18% versus the comparable period, led by beef where sales improved by more than $350 million on a year-to-date basis. Asia has been a key driver of beef export strength. We\u2019ve also seen some strength in industrial, particularly in beef and pork, and finally year-to-date sales grew $79 million or approximately 6% in our international business. This business is a growth priority for Tyson and we continue to invest to develop further capacities and capabilities in new markets to meet growing global consumer demand for protein products. Current capacity expansions across seven international locations are expected to dramatically increase our fully cooked production capabilities. These investments are fully aligned to our strategic growth priorities and when complete will enhance our international processing capacity by close to 30% versus fiscal 2020. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the company\u2019s top line growth year to date. We are carefully managing the current inflationary pressures through pricing actions as well as commercial and operational excellence with emphasis on productivity and cost. We know that our price recovery efforts relative to inflation must be matched by equal aggressiveness on productivity.  Slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income. Production inefficiencies and low labor availability resulted in total company volumes roughly flat to the comparable period a year ago; however, we are encouraged by the volume improvement we are seeing across our segments in the third quarter. Price mix benefited substantially in the year-to-date period from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong beef segment performance, and continued retail strength across segments.  Operating income was partially offset by $2.2 billion in increased cost of goods sold for the period, reflecting meaningful inflation in raw material and supply chain costs. Feed ingredients, labor, packaging and freight are all key components of this COGS increase, which we\u2019re working to mitigate.  On a comparative basis, SG&A benefited from the $56 million loss in the year-to-date fiscal 2020 period as compared to a $55 million gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, associated with the cattle supplier incident. This was in addition to certain reductions in trade spend and travel costs.  Moving into the chicken segment results, sales were $3.5 billion for the third quarter, up 12%. Volumes were also up in the quarter due to continued strength in retail, improving demand through food service and segment-wide operational improvements. These were partially offset by COVID-related production inefficiencies.  Average sales price was up 15% in the quarter due to favorable mix, sustained retail volume, and strong supply and demand fundamentals. Our reported price improvement also reflects actions we took to cover the inflationary pressures seen from higher grain, labor, and freight costs. Our conversations with customers on widespread inflationary pressures have been productive and we\u2019ll continue to partner with customers to ensure we receive a fair return on our products while working to deliver service levels and fill rates that meet or exceed their expectations. Operating income was $27 million in the third quarter and $137 million on a fiscal year-to-date basis, both stronger than comparable periods a year ago. This represents an operating margin of 1.3% year to date. Fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $410 million of higher feed ingredient costs as well as $210 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. For the third quarter, feed ingredients were $270 million higher while grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases were $110 million higher. Segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the third quarter of $125 million and $235 million on a year-to-date basis, both versus the respective comparable periods. These results are associated with realized gains as well as open positions.  Moving now to prepared foods, sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 14% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was up 4.5% in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in food service. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by the pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending, and better sales mix.  Segment operating income was $150 million for the quarter, up over 3% versus the prior year. Year-to-date operating income was $633 million, up 23% versus the prior year period. Operating margins for the segment were 6.5% for the third quarter, a decline of 60 basis points versus the comparable year-ago period. The slow-down in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year were driven by significant increases in raw material input costs; however, on a year-to-date basis, our operating margin of 9.6% was up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable pricing and lower commercial spend. Demand for the balance of the year is expected to remain elevated at retail with volumes continuing to exceed pre-COVID levels and food service continuing to recover. During the third quarter, core business lines experienced volume share growth of 90 basis points while dollar share grew 70 basis points. We continue to believe that the ongoing inflationary environment will create a meaningful headwind for prepared foods in the upcoming quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor are all challenging our cost of production. To offset inflationary pressure, we\u2019re focused on pricing, revenue management, and commercial spend optimization while ensuring the continued build of brand equity through marketing and trade support.  Moving to the beef segment, segment sales were over $4.9 billion for the quarter, up 36% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products with average sales price up 12% for the quarter. We had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. Mounting drought conditions in the western United States cattle growing region as well as elevated costs for grain also drove some cattle supply liquidation. We have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal \u201922 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs.  Sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago, driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion for the quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cut-out. This was partially offset by higher operating costs.  Operating margins for the segment improved 520 basis points to 22.6% for the third quarter. While our beef segment experienced tremendous results on a year-to-date basis, we\u2019re still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput within our beef plants due to labor challenges; meanwhile, drought conditions and elevated grain prices are creating incremental costs and risks for cattle producers. Until these conditions stabilize and within the constraints I\u2019ve mentioned, we will work to maximize our beef processing capacity to provide a reliable outlook for our livestock farmers and adequate product supply for customers and consumers. Now let\u2019s move onto the pork segment on Slide 16. Third quarter results reflect higher hog costs and operating expenses that weren\u2019t fully offset through pork cut-out. Segment sales were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 54% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased more than 39% while volumes were also up relative to the same period last year.  Segment operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 37% versus the comparable period. Overall operating margins for the segment declined by 570 basis points to 3.9% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. Through the end of this calendar year, lower projected 2021 pork production and strong consumer demand are expected to support hog prices well above 2020 levels.  Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Given the continued strength in our beef segment and ongoing inflationary pressures that are partially being recovered through price, we\u2019re raising our sales guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $46 billion to $47 billion. At the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance to hold. Key risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor cost and availability, grain costs in the chicken segment, raw material costs for each of our businesses, and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meats.  We\u2019re slightly revising our outlook on effective tax rate to approximately 22.5%. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the potential implications of new legislation, but we do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year.  While our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged, liquidity during the third quarter improved substantially to $3.4 billion and has since benefited from $1.2 billion of pre-tax proceeds from the divestiture of our pet treats business in early July.  Finally, we expect our COVID-related costs, which totaled $55 million in the quarter, to be approximately $325 million for the year. As a reminder, some of the costs that were previously described as COVID-related have evolved to become structural.  Turning to Slide 18, in pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially de-levered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. Each of these levers individually and in aggregate will support strong return generation for our shareholders. We will also continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through M&A through the lens of value creation and shareholder return.  Finally, we are committed to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. In short, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business as both strong and diverse, and we expect our capital allocation framework to deliver solid returns for our shareholders in the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thanks Stewart. To close, our priorities are clear: being the most sought after place to work, being our customers\u2019 go-to supplier, and doing so while driving operational and functional excellence across all areas of our business. There\u2019s a lot to be excited about. We look forward to discussing where we\u2019re headed during our upcoming investor day and hope you can join us. Thank you for your interest today in Tyson Foods. Megan?\nMegan Britt: Thanks Donnie. We\u2019ll now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A.  Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. \nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey guys, good morning. Thank you for taking the question.\nStewart Glendinning: Morning Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Donnie, maybe if we could just start reiterating the back half \u201922 chicken outlook of 5% to 7%. Based on your prepared comments, a lot of things are starting to move slowly but in the right direction, so I guess the question is what prevents that from getting pulled forward a bit? Is it just that these hatch related issues just take much more time, the automation doesn\u2019t kick in until later into \u201922, or does something else change incrementally, and maybe really around the labor picture, has it gotten worse since the last time we spoke?\nDonnie King: Thanks for that question, Peter. Let me start with this - as we look forward, the fundamentals of our business look good going forward. We have strong retail and food service demand. We haven\u2019t changed our approach - chicken is our top priority for me and for our company. We continue to execute our plan, that hasn\u2019t changed, and that starts with staffing our plants and servicing our customers, and we have to be the most competitive chicken business, but we also want to grow the business. We are committed to top tier performance. We\u2019re committed to the 5% to 7% AOI by mid-FY22 that we talked about earlier, and we\u2019re committed to becoming the most sought after place to work, and we talked a lot about that in the prepare remarks. We\u2019ve increased wages, and this includes a benefit up to $22 an hour. We\u2019ve instituted flexible work schedules and shifts. We\u2019re piloting childcare and onsite health clinics for our team members and their families. We\u2019re solving transportation problems for our team members. We\u2019re investing heavily in automation and technology and trying to automate those most difficult and higher turnover jobs.  I talked last time, just so you can understand the basis of this, the seven levers of our business in chicken are price, volume, mix, labor, [indiscernible] in live, and so let me touch on each of those for a moment. In our live operations, the plan to improve hatch is well underway. The new males will be in place by this fall, as we talked about 2Q. We will see harvest capacity increase by mid-fiscal \u201922, so here is kind of the formula, that better hatch equals more birds, which equals more volume which equals better service which equals a better cost structure, which equals better performance and ultimately better results for us. But until then, to your point and your question, we are improving hatch and harvest volumes now. Even with these headwinds, we are better than an average company by a sizeable margin in our live production area, and we\u2019ll get sequentially better between now and mid-\u201922.  If I look at spend, we talked a lot last time about outside purchases, and Stewart mentioned earlier that we decreased that by 25%, although at a higher price. The thing that is challenging now is we\u2019re paying a lot of overtime because of the inefficiency associated with labor, which is absenteeism and turnover. We\u2019ve had inflation on all inputs. We believe grain in our cost of goods will crest in early Q4 - in fact, it has based on the forward-looking curve. This is in our cost of goods. We\u2019ve seen great improvements in our cost management and our execution by our team. Much of that has been masked by inflation. Then go to labor - labor is our single biggest issue we face, not only in chicken but also in our other businesses. We\u2019ve increased wages and created flexible shifts and childcare onsite clinics. The delta variant has been a disruptor - we were on a good trajectory and then the delta variant showed up, and we\u2019ve taken a step back as a result of that. We\u2019ve got plans to mitigate that, but the health and safety of our team members is our highest priority. We are more inefficient than we have historically been, certainly a big part of what we have to solve, but essentially it takes us six days to get five days\u2019 worth of work. I will tell you that execution has improved sequentially through the year.  Our volumes\u2019 up in the quarter. [Indiscernible] as our finished good sales. Volume is negatively impacted by harvesting below plan, which we\u2019ve talked about, as a result of hatch. We started this year with a plan to grow the business and grow our head and grow our sales, but our by-product and export sales are our biggest misses from a volume perspective. We will see volume increase between now and mid-\u201922 - that\u2019s in hatch, that\u2019s in head harvest, and that\u2019s in volume to our plants.  From a mix standpoint, we\u2019ve added volume. Value-added volume is very strong - that\u2019s ready-to-eat product, that\u2019s par fry product, that\u2019s our frozen value-added branded products. That\u2019s the heart and soul of our business in chicken. We are at capacity with strong retail and food service demand. As Stewart referenced earlier, we\u2019re adding lines and plants to address very strong demand.  Our pricing is up 16% in the quarter. Most of this increase came in June and even more in July. We worked with our customers and they\u2019ve been very responsive. Our relationships are very strong with our customers. We\u2019ve been successful in getting pricing. Grain also at the same time has continued to escalate and pricing will certainly lag the cost in this scenario. We\u2019re just simply asking for fair market value for these products. Long story short, we are executing better, we are performing better. We have a great deal of inflation led by grain, but we\u2019ve gotten pricing around and so as we move into every month and quarter from here, I would expect us to be sequentially better, and that 5% to 7% that we talked about by mid-\u201922, we\u2019re committed to that and we stand with that number.\nPeter Galbo: Great, thanks Donnie. That\u2019s very helpful, just all of the detail there. For the follow-up question, Stewart, I guess what\u2019s changed in your prepared comments around prepared foods? Last quarter, I think you had talked about the inflation coming through, maybe it\u2019s accelerated a bit, but that you\u2019d be turning on that spending in the back half of the year, and maybe that wasn\u2019t the case in 3Q and more so in 4Q, so is there just a change there and maybe when can we expect that to start to flow through more? Thanks.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes, thanks. We did turn that on Q3 - it was one of the downward levers as we had to dial back in, in the retail space, so it\u2019s already running through the numbers. It\u2019s earlier in the year where you saw the benefit, and the back half of the year you\u2019re going to see the increases, and that\u2019s part of what\u2019s in our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead with your questions.\nKen Zaslow: Hey, good morning guys.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nKen Zaslow: Just a quick follow-up. You know, the parent stock that\u2019s being rolled out fairly quickly, which is actually positive, can you talk about how confident you are that it will take and that there will not be any issues, that the hatch rates and the productivity will be in line with your expectations, and if there are any risks in how you see it? That\u2019s my first question.\nDonnie King: Sure, thanks Ken. As you know, we talked about the fact that this would be phased in starting and completing by, let\u2019s call it fall. That work is underway, and we have converted some of the male stock and we\u2019ve seen some results associated with that. Everything we have seen thus far would be in line with what we expected, and we see no reason to expect any disruption from that. From that standpoint, everything looks good. It looks like it\u2019s on track to deliver what the--the timing that we\u2019ve talked about thus far. \nKen Zaslow: Great. Just to flip to the other side, the beef business, for the last year or so, between COVID and unfortunately your fire, it seems like there\u2019s been a lot of cattle that just hasn\u2019t [indiscernible] as quickly as people may have expected, so although we maybe going through an underlying contraction, there seems to be a lot more cattle out there through probably at least--you know, through the winter, if not through 2022. Would you agree with that, would you kind of put parameters around that? How do you see that? Then as a follow-up to that, the export side with China and Japan, the trade policies, that seems to be--and a shortage of Australian beef, that seems like there\u2019s a duration to the export picture as well. I\u2019ll leave it there, and I appreciate your time.\nDonnie King: You bet, Ken. Let me say this, and I think your view of beef, where we had ample cattle supplies and where we had really strong demand, we were constricted in the middle based on labor availability. I talked about this in chicken earlier, but in our beef business it essentially takes us six days to get five days\u2019 worth of work, so the inefficiency associated with that allowed cattle to back up on the ranch and in feed lots. Here\u2019s what we know as we look into \u201922. Fed supplies are expected to be down about half a percent, June cattle on feed is projected to be up 1.9%. There has been some herd liquidation in the west and northern plains, which according to Cattlefacts is about 33% of the U.S. cow calf production is in this drought area, but \u201922 is looking good. Is it going to be at the same level at which we were--where we are in \u201921? Probably not, I don\u2019t think it will be that good. I think it will be better than historical returns, and I\u2019m talking that 1% to 3% which we\u2019ve talked about forever. It\u2019ll be north of that, we think, but we think all in all beef will have a very nice year in \u201922.  In terms of exports, to the other part of your question, Asian growth is still solid. U.S. grain fed beef is preferred around the world and, as you mentioned, key global beef suppliers are rebuilding herds in Australia, Brazil and Canada, so all of that is true, so strong export demand for us as well as domestic.\nKen Zaslow: Okay, I appreciate it as always.\nDonnie King: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nBen Theurer: Thank you very much, good morning Donnie and Stewart. The first question is on what your plans are within the prepared foods business, just more structurally. Clearly we\u2019re seeing how pricing is coming through and impacting your beef and pork results, but that obviously puts a lot of pressure on prepared foods, and you\u2019ve talked about the input cost pressure by the end of the year. So far we\u2019re running at about a 9.5% bridge, but you\u2019ve always talked about this 10% to 12% range, so what is it, what keeps you away from being more aggressive on pricing within the prepared foods business, to really pass on more of that internal inflationary pressure you\u2019re seeing on the ingredients side, just to bring it back to the low teens levels, but I think guidance as well for the year is just below that 10% level. Just to understand what needs to be seen in the market so you\u2019re going to be able to put pricing through.\nDonnie King: Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Ben. We\u2019re still very proud of our prepared foods business, and if I look at the detail behind this, demand is expected to remain elevated. Retail orders, for example, are up 30% versus pre-COVID levels. Food service is showing a sequential improvement as well. We have seen accelerating and unprecedented inflation, so what do you do about that? Well, we have significant food service pricing already in the market. Retail pricing will be in the market by September 5. Inflation is up about 14% during our 3Q and 9% year-to-date. We\u2019ve had--just like other businesses, we\u2019ve had labor and absenteeism and turnover in the business, we have a number of open positions, so that certainly has made us inefficient, and so we\u2019ve got aggressive pricing going on. Aggressive revenue management and commercial spend management will help mitigate a portion of these inflationary impacts. We\u2019ll have to get more price, but we\u2019re comfortable that over time that our prepared foods is a double-digit business for us, and it\u2019s just costs are hitting us faster that we can get pricing at this point.\nBen Theurer: Perfect, and then my follow-up question is around the capital allocation. You\u2019ve mentioned M&A would be one of the opportunities. Could you, without obviously going into specifics, but could you explore a little bit of where you think you would have to invest? Is it on the international business, is it investing into new facilities or just acquiring new facilities to sort of broaden the footprint in a certain segment? Just to understand a little bit where your focus would be from an M&A perspective. \nStewart Glendinning: Yes, this is Stewart, I\u2019ll pick that up. I think in terms of the specifics from M&A, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve talked to what specific places we\u2019re going to put the money, but let\u2019s just talk about overall our view of capital allocation. First of all, we really feel great about the current position of our balance sheet. Our liquidity was $3.4 billion coming out of the quarter - that was before we took the receipt of the $1.2 billion from pet, and we did repay about $500 million worth of debt subsequent to the end of the quarter, so the balance sheet is very healthy. From an investment standpoint, one of the things that we talked about both in the prepared remarks and in last quarter is that we expect to invest behind our business. We have significant opportunities to invest in expanding our capacity, and I spoke this morning about international, that that will be a growth area for us. The capex that\u2019s going into the international space and new facilities will expand their capacity by 30% when compared to last year - that\u2019s a big deal, and I think when you look at the rest of our business, Donnie spoke this morning about automation, and you\u2019re seeing that both across prepared foods as well as in our chicken business, which will certainly help our labor, it will help our efficiency. Then you look at where we\u2019re putting money in terms of new facilities. Humboldt has gone live, we\u2019ve got a new case-ready facility in Utah that will be coming online shortly, as well as one in South Carolina, so we\u2019ve got a pretty active internal agenda. If something on the outside presents itself that we think makes sense for our investors, then we\u2019ll obviously take a look at that. Hopefully that gives you a flavor for where we\u2019re investing our money.\nBen Theurer: Perfect, thanks Stewart.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thank you. I\u2019ve got a couple questions, one on the retail side, Donnie. You said that pricing is having trouble keeping up with the inflation, but you do have an increase coming in September. To what extent does that fully offset all the inflation you\u2019ve seen, or should you need another price increase right after that because it\u2019s an upward sloping curve?\nDonnie King: Thanks Robert. What you\u2019ve said--I mean, you quoted everything I said earlier, but with retail with the branded portfolio, it can take a little bit longer to get pricing in. We typically don\u2019t disclose that kind of information about when we\u2019d do it, but here\u2019s generally the way we think about this, is that when raw materials--when inputs go up, pricing has to go up, particularly in an environment where we have such rapid and accelerating inflation. We have little choice but to go and to--we certainly have to be competitive, but we certainly have to get pricing to cover the increase in inputs, and we\u2019re doing that and we\u2019re doing that very methodically. We\u2019re looking at all the metrics around that as we do that, but we\u2019re doing it in a very responsible way. Noelle O\u2019Mara and her team are managing that around the clock.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. It sounds like it\u2019s--well, I\u2019m not sure what that means, Donnie. If the inflation that you experienced in the middle of this year is being offset by pricing on September 5, like you say, but it sounds like inflation continues to rise, can I say that that\u2019s a fair statement? \nStewart Glendinning: Maybe just a couple things. I\u2019m going to just jump in and give you a couple of facts here. Actually if you looked at inflation, the biggest driver for prepared foods as being the input costs of commodities, and of course for prepared foods that mostly is pork, you\u2019ve got that along with the increase in that spend, which I referred to later. In terms of thinking about price, I think what Donnie\u2019s saying is when we think that commodities are going up, or any inputs are going up, we\u2019re going to match that with pricing. That pricing may not follow exactly the track of input inflation, but you also need to think about how that input inflation can move along. When we\u2019ve got labor cost increases which are going into our workforce, you should think about those as more permanent, of course, but you\u2019ve seen these cycles around commodities and you\u2019ll have to take a view of what you think pork, the cost of pork will do over the course of next year. If pork comes off, then that will be a help to us; if pork doesn\u2019t come off, then I think Donnie\u2019s point is that we will continue to take price to match the nature of the cost that\u2019s coming to us.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, great. I appreciate it. On food service, obviously continued sequential improvement and then big improvement versus a year ago. How are your customers viewing the next three to six months? Do they view reopening pace continuing to accelerate or are there concerns about the delta variant slowing things down, and to what extent are you back to 2019 levels in terms of food service?\nDonnie King: Well food service, from everyone I\u2019ve talked to, based on what we see from a demand perspective is very strong. We\u2019re at or near across all businesses, and some are even above from food service, from let\u2019s call it pre-COVID levels in \u201919. I don\u2019t know that anyone fully understands what\u2019s going to happen with the delta variant, and there is certainly some concern about that; but everyone I talk to in food service is optimistic about the future and for their businesses in particular.\nRobert Moskow: Great. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey, thanks so much. Good morning everybody. \nStewart Glendinning: Morning Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to ask about the decision to mandate the COVID vaccines in your facilities, and really from the standpoint of knowing that labor is exceptionally tight, does that create a dynamic where it potentially makes labor more tight or is the net impact of that, you know, it gives you enough certainty around your ability to have continuity in running your facilities that in some ways it kind of [indiscernible] the labor dynamic when you think about trying to get the chicken margins back up and managing your plants at target utilization rates?\nDonnie King: Sure, thank you Ben. As we\u2019ve talked a lot, even in our prepared remarks today but they didn\u2019t just start today, the health and safety of our team is our highest priority. If you go back and look even in the beginnings of the pandemic, Tyson did a number of things to protect our team members; in fact, I would tell you we did everything we knew to do to protect our team members, that was our highest priority, to mask mandates to barriers within plants to social distancing to staggering shifts to temperature sensors and health screenings prior to going to work every day. We did everything that we knew to do. With the new vaccine, it\u2019s a new tool. We believe that vaccine is the most effective thing, the most effective tool available today. We\u2019ve studied the data, we\u2019ve researched it to the nth degree, and we\u2019re confident in doing that, and so we mandated that because we thought it would be irresponsible not to do that and irresponsible not to protect our team members in every way that we could.  Now there could be some short term impacts, but I think they certainly will be offset by long term benefit in doing this, so that\u2019s the position that we have taken. It\u2019s out of just an abundance of caution and care for our team members.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, thanks for that. My second question is on the chicken business. You talked about the critical path to achieving the margin targets you have for middle of next fiscal year. Could I ask about it from a capacity utilization standpoint? I know you have Humboldt coming online and ramping up to capacity. In the years past, I think your utilization rate has been 89%, 90% or so. When you think about the full year for 2022, is that too high of a water mark to hit on capacity utilization, or should we think about maybe you getting back to that level by the end of fiscal 2022? How should we think about the ramp of getting back to those utilization rates? \nDonnie King: Yes, great question Ben. A couple things with respect to that. When we started fiscal \u201921, we had plans in place to increase our harvest head based on capacity utilization, based on demand that we already had, and with the hatch issues, certainly that created a shortfall in terms of head for our business, and then we\u2019d go outside and start buying. As we have changed this male out and we are starting to see results of that, that will ultimately end up in more head for us to harvest, which is exactly our plan to--we already have that product sold, but I would expect as we move into \u201922 and beyond, that you\u2019ll see our capacity utilization increase at Tyson from a harvest perspective, and all that will be in service to supporting our value-added branded portfolio.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, thanks and best of luck.\nDonnie King: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson\u2019s line from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. \nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: I guess my first question is really on that last point, Donnie, around capacity utilization in poultry. I\u2019m just trying to think about how quickly and how far you could push it. If I\u2019m looking the last 10-K based on a five-day week, the poultry business was at an 84% operating rate in fiscal \u201920. I\u2019d imagine it probably was leaking lower than that in fiscal \u201921 given some of the hatch issues. I\u2019m just trying to just dimensionalize where do we think that\u2019s actually going? You guys are about 20% of the industry, so if there\u2019s a meaningful change in your own internal production and hatch, it starts to have some meaningful impacts at the industry level in terms of available live supply. Any way you could help frame that?\nDonnie King: Sure Adam, I think you described it very well and in a lot of ways even answered this. You talked about based on what you saw, that it was 84%. Well, obviously 84% capacity utilization in a protein business is not a good number - we acknowledge that. It certainly has cost implications for your product and in fact can keep you uncompetitive in that space, so we acknowledge that. There is a number of--we need a number of head, you can do the math on how much outside meat we\u2019re purchasing based on volume, and you could probably convert that to head. I mean, one of the things that we could--the quick math would tell you is that being able to run those products through our plants and being able to debone those chickens and go into our further processed assets, and at the same time get credit for all the by-products through the ingredient solution group and then have the ability with our One Tyson approach to being able to sell export leg quarters and paws and so forth, along with just the further processing volume increases that we would get, all of that adds up to a much better cost scenario and a much better performance in our chicken business.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Then the follow-up on an unrelated topic, California has their Prop 12 mandate supposedly coming into effect on January 1 and has implications in terms of the pork that\u2019s supplied into the California market. Wondering how, if at all, we should be thinking about the impact of that both to your pork and prepared foods businesses next year.\nDonnie King: Yes, great question Adam. As we look at Prop 12, it\u2019s about 4% of total production - that\u2019s not significant for us today. Tyson is currently aligning and incentivizing suppliers where appropriate. We can do multiple programs simultaneously, including Prop 12, so it\u2019s not something we\u2019re excited about but we can align suppliers and we can certainly provide the raw material to service our customers in that way.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay, I appreciate the color. I\u2019ll pass it on, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein . Please go ahead with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning everyone. \nDonnie King: Good morning Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Can I ask first of all about labor costs - they\u2019ve obviously escalating, I think you talked about $22 an hour. I\u2019m just wondering how much of an increase you\u2019re expecting on a permanent basis. I know that right now with overtime and incremental payments, it\u2019s probably higher than the long term level, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for how much it\u2019s going up relative to pre-COVID levels.\nDonnie King: There is a pretty significant increase and a pretty significant cost increase associated with that, but in a lot of respects the market is doing its job. Based on availability of labor as being in shorter supply, it\u2019s going up and I don\u2019t see any reduction in that. We believe we\u2019re in a good place. We believe we are at the top of the market, if you will, in terms of jobs similar to this. We certainly are very competitive in all the communities where we have assets producing protein, so we\u2019re comfortable with where we are but it certainly has increased.  But in order to get people into your production location, it\u2019s more than just wage. I want to make that clear. We have to do other things, and I outlined a number of those things that we\u2019re doing around childcare, transportation, onsite clinics, providing a safe place to work, flexible shifts and number of shifts in a week. It\u2019s a combination of all those things and doing all those things well, so when you hear us talk about being the most sought after place to work, those are the type of things that we have to do in order to be able to service our customers and grow our business.\nAlexia Howard: Great, and as a follow-up, just a quick one, of the $325 million in incremental COVID costs expected this year, you talked about a certain proportion of that becoming permanent. Can you quantify that?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes Alexia, it\u2019s Stewart. First of all, we feel good about COVID sequentially going down $65 million or so in the quarter, so that\u2019s about half. We\u2019ve seen sort a progressive--the progression has sort of been 50%, but we think over the course of the year the structural costs are going to be counted in around $200 million or more. But understand that\u2019s in our run rate, right, so anything that has become structural, you\u2019re already seeing it\u2019s flowing through the numbers. I wouldn\u2019t think about that in terms of all of a sudden that\u2019s going to be added to next year. A lot of that are the labor increases that Donnie was talking to.\nAlexia Howard: Very helpful, thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll be concluding today\u2019s question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Donnie King for any closing remarks. \nDonnie King: Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We hope you and your families stay healthy and safe, and we\u2019ll look forward to speaking again soon. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Stewart Glendinning",
            "content": "Thank you Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. Sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter. Volumes were up 9.7% primarily due to strength in retail and the ongoing food service recovery. Average sales price was also up about 17% largely due to strong results in our beef segment, the mix benefit from retail volume, and the partial recovery of raw material inflation in net sales price.  Operating income was up 81% in the third quarter due to continued strong performance in our beef business. Chicken and prepared foods also improved their respective segment earnings, while pork earnings were down versus the comparable period a year ago.  Year to date operating income for the total company improved by 49%. Earnings per share grew 93% in the third quarter due largely to strength in operating income, specifically within our beef segment. EPS was up 61% on a year-to-date basis. We performed well despite a challenging operating environment that spanned tough labor availability, significant inflationary pressures on raw material costs, global supply chain challenges, and an evolving demand backdrop.  Slide 11 bridges our total company sales on a year-to-date basis. We delivered growth in the retail channel along all reporting segments which, in aggregate, accounted for more than $1 billion in sales improvement over the year-to-date period and more than $300 million in the third quarter versus the respective comparable periods.  Moving to food service, sales improved by approximately $1.3 billion in the third quarter, leading to a year-to-date improvement for the channel of nearly $1 billion compared to the same period last year. Exports were up over 18% versus the comparable period, led by beef where sales improved by more than $350 million on a year-to-date basis. Asia has been a key driver of beef export strength. We've also seen some strength in industrial, particularly in beef and pork, and finally year-to-date sales grew $79 million or approximately 6% in our international business. This business is a growth priority for Tyson and we continue to invest to develop further capacities and capabilities in new markets to meet growing global consumer demand for protein products. Current capacity expansions across seven international locations are expected to dramatically increase our fully cooked production capabilities. These investments are fully aligned to our strategic growth priorities and when complete will enhance our international processing capacity by close to 30% versus fiscal 2020. Overall, we're pleased with the company's top line growth year to date. We are carefully managing the current inflationary pressures through pricing actions as well as commercial and operational excellence with emphasis on productivity and cost. We know that our price recovery efforts relative to inflation must be matched by equal aggressiveness on productivity.  Slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income. Production inefficiencies and low labor availability resulted in total company volumes roughly flat to the comparable period a year ago; however, we are encouraged by the volume improvement we are seeing across our segments in the third quarter. Price mix benefited substantially in the year-to-date period from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong beef segment performance, and continued retail strength across segments.  Operating income was partially offset by $2.2 billion in increased cost of goods sold for the period, reflecting meaningful inflation in raw material and supply chain costs. Feed ingredients, labor, packaging and freight are all key components of this COGS increase, which we're working to mitigate.  On a comparative basis, SG&A benefited from the $56 million loss in the year-to-date fiscal 2020 period as compared to a $55 million gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, associated with the cattle supplier incident. This was in addition to certain reductions in trade spend and travel costs.  Moving into the chicken segment results, sales were $3.5 billion for the third quarter, up 12%. Volumes were also up in the quarter due to continued strength in retail, improving demand through food service and segment-wide operational improvements. These were partially offset by COVID-related production inefficiencies.  Average sales price was up 15% in the quarter due to favorable mix, sustained retail volume, and strong supply and demand fundamentals. Our reported price improvement also reflects actions we took to cover the inflationary pressures seen from higher grain, labor, and freight costs. Our conversations with customers on widespread inflationary pressures have been productive and we'll continue to partner with customers to ensure we receive a fair return on our products while working to deliver service levels and fill rates that meet or exceed their expectations. Operating income was $27 million in the third quarter and $137 million on a fiscal year-to-date basis, both stronger than comparable periods a year ago. This represents an operating margin of 1.3% year to date. Fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $410 million of higher feed ingredient costs as well as $210 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. For the third quarter, feed ingredients were $270 million higher while grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases were $110 million higher. Segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the third quarter of $125 million and $235 million on a year-to-date basis, both versus the respective comparable periods. These results are associated with realized gains as well as open positions.  Moving now to prepared foods, sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 14% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was up 4.5% in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in food service. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by the pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending, and better sales mix.  Segment operating income was $150 million for the quarter, up over 3% versus the prior year. Year-to-date operating income was $633 million, up 23% versus the prior year period. Operating margins for the segment were 6.5% for the third quarter, a decline of 60 basis points versus the comparable year-ago period. The slow-down in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year were driven by significant increases in raw material input costs; however, on a year-to-date basis, our operating margin of 9.6% was up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable pricing and lower commercial spend. Demand for the balance of the year is expected to remain elevated at retail with volumes continuing to exceed pre-COVID levels and food service continuing to recover. During the third quarter, core business lines experienced volume share growth of 90 basis points while dollar share grew 70 basis points. We continue to believe that the ongoing inflationary environment will create a meaningful headwind for prepared foods in the upcoming quarter. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor are all challenging our cost of production. To offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management, and commercial spend optimization while ensuring the continued build of brand equity through marketing and trade support.  Moving to the beef segment, segment sales were over $4.9 billion for the quarter, up 36% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included strong domestic and export demand for beef products with average sales price up 12% for the quarter. We had ample livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. Mounting drought conditions in the western United States cattle growing region as well as elevated costs for grain also drove some cattle supply liquidation. We have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal '22 and currently believe it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs.  Sales volume for the quarter was up year-over-year due to continued strong demand in contrast to a soft comparable period a year ago, driven by lower production volumes. We delivered segment operating income of $1.1 billion for the quarter. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cut-out. This was partially offset by higher operating costs.  Operating margins for the segment improved 520 basis points to 22.6% for the third quarter. While our beef segment experienced tremendous results on a year-to-date basis, we're still not at optimal levels of capacity throughput within our beef plants due to labor challenges; meanwhile, drought conditions and elevated grain prices are creating incremental costs and risks for cattle producers. Until these conditions stabilize and within the constraints I've mentioned, we will work to maximize our beef processing capacity to provide a reliable outlook for our livestock farmers and adequate product supply for customers and consumers. Now let's move onto the pork segment on Slide 16. Third quarter results reflect higher hog costs and operating expenses that weren't fully offset through pork cut-out. Segment sales were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 54% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased more than 39% while volumes were also up relative to the same period last year.  Segment operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 37% versus the comparable period. Overall operating margins for the segment declined by 570 basis points to 3.9% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. Through the end of this calendar year, lower projected 2021 pork production and strong consumer demand are expected to support hog prices well above 2020 levels.  Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Given the continued strength in our beef segment and ongoing inflationary pressures that are partially being recovered through price, we're raising our sales guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $46 billion to $47 billion. At the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance to hold. Key risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor cost and availability, grain costs in the chicken segment, raw material costs for each of our businesses, and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meats.  We're slightly revising our outlook on effective tax rate to approximately 22.5%. We'll continue to monitor the potential implications of new legislation, but we do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year.  While our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged, liquidity during the third quarter improved substantially to $3.4 billion and has since benefited from $1.2 billion of pre-tax proceeds from the divestiture of our pet treats business in early July.  Finally, we expect our COVID-related costs, which totaled $55 million in the quarter, to be approximately $325 million for the year. As a reminder, some of the costs that were previously described as COVID-related have evolved to become structural.  Turning to Slide 18, in pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we have substantially de-levered our business over the past 12 months, reducing leverage to 1.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Investing organically in our business will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. Each of these levers individually and in aggregate will support strong return generation for our shareholders. We will also continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through M&A through the lens of value creation and shareholder return.  Finally, we are committed to return cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. In short, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business as both strong and diverse, and we expect our capital allocation framework to deliver solid returns for our shareholders in the future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Donnie. Morning Peter. Yes, thanks. We did turn that on Q3 - it was one of the downward levers as we had to dial back in, in the retail space, so it's already running through the numbers. It's earlier in the year where you saw the benefit, and the back half of the year you're going to see the increases, and that's part of what's in our guidance. Yes, this is Stewart, I'll pick that up. I think in terms of the specifics from M&A, I don't think we've talked to what specific places we're going to put the money, but let's just talk about overall our view of capital allocation. First of all, we really feel great about the current position of our balance sheet. Our liquidity was $3.4 billion coming out of the quarter - that was before we took the receipt of the $1.2 billion from pet, and we did repay about $500 million worth of debt subsequent to the end of the quarter, so the balance sheet is very healthy. From an investment standpoint, one of the things that we talked about both in the prepared remarks and in last quarter is that we expect to invest behind our business. We have significant opportunities to invest in expanding our capacity, and I spoke this morning about international, that that will be a growth area for us. The capex that's going into the international space and new facilities will expand their capacity by 30% when compared to last year - that's a big deal, and I think when you look at the rest of our business, Donnie spoke this morning about automation, and you're seeing that both across prepared foods as well as in our chicken business, which will certainly help our labor, it will help our efficiency. Then you look at where we're putting money in terms of new facilities. Humboldt has gone live, we've got a new case-ready facility in Utah that will be coming online shortly, as well as one in South Carolina, so we've got a pretty active internal agenda. If something on the outside presents itself that we think makes sense for our investors, then we'll obviously take a look at that. Hopefully that gives you a flavor for where we're investing our money. Maybe just a couple things. I'm going to just jump in and give you a couple of facts here. Actually if you looked at inflation, the biggest driver for prepared foods as being the input costs of commodities, and of course for prepared foods that mostly is pork, you've got that along with the increase in that spend, which I referred to later. In terms of thinking about price, I think what Donnie's saying is when we think that commodities are going up, or any inputs are going up, we're going to match that with pricing. That pricing may not follow exactly the track of input inflation, but you also need to think about how that input inflation can move along. When we've got labor cost increases which are going into our workforce, you should think about those as more permanent, of course, but you've seen these cycles around commodities and you'll have to take a view of what you think pork, the cost of pork will do over the course of next year. If pork comes off, then that will be a help to us; if pork doesn't come off, then I think Donnie's point is that we will continue to take price to match the nature of the cost that's coming to us. Morning Ben. Yes Alexia, it's Stewart. First of all, we feel good about COVID sequentially going down $65 million or so in the quarter, so that's about half. We've seen sort a progressive--the progression has sort of been 50%, but we think over the course of the year the structural costs are going to be counted in around $200 million or more. But understand that's in our run rate, right, so anything that has become structural, you're already seeing it's flowing through the numbers. I wouldn't think about that in terms of all of a sudden that's going to be added to next year. A lot of that are the labor increases that Donnie was talking to."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thank you Megan.  As many of you know, I've been a Tyson team member for close to four decades, and in that time I've led every business segment. We've always believed in our mission and the vision of John W. Tyson, who founded this company nearly a century ago because he wanted to find a better way to feed a growing country. Today on my first earnings call as CEO, I am incredibly proud to stand alongside our team members to continue that legacy. It's an interesting time to be in this industry and we have a leadership team that together can capitalize on the strengths of this company and the opportunities ahead.  Let's begin with a view of our overall performance this quarter. First, our retail performance - 12 consecutive quarters of retail share gains in our core business line is driven by strength of our brands along with solid execution from our team. We are in a market that has demonstrated strong demand for protein and people are reaching most for brands they trust. Our billion-dollar brands - Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farms have driven strong share growth with consumers buying more than ever before.  Second, we saw in the third quarter growing volume in food service channels as reopening and recovery continues. We saw uptick from outlets nationwide reflected in our sales, which we were up $1.3 billion for the quarter. Our broad production and distribution network is well positioned to meet this growing demand.  Third, the diversity of our portfolio demonstrated its value during the quarter. Led by beef, we delivered an exceptional result as strong U.S. and export demand coupled with ample cattle supply supported elevated margins in that business.  Fourth, we continue to build financial strength. This quarter, we used higher operating cash flow to reduce debt. The steps we've taken position us with a very strong balance sheet and high levels of liquidity. Finally, we are investing in future growth across our portfolio. We're in the process of bringing 12 new plants online globally to address capacity constraints and growing demand.  In all, Tyson delivered a strong quarter. As we look to the future, we want to build on these strengths. Let's look at how we plan to do that. First, we have built a solid footing to drive consistent results. Our strengths include a diverse portfolio, well known, trusted brands, scale in meaningful markets, and an exceptionally strong balance sheet.  Second, labor is our number one challenge, so we have continued our focus on improving our team member experience without compromising their health and safety. We are accelerating efforts to make Tyson the most sought after place to work because we know how important team members are to our business. One of the ways we're doing this is to accelerate our investments in automation and technology. This not only helps us to eliminate more difficult, hard to fill tasks, but also re-skills our labor profile to enable their contributions to more value-added activities. Third, we are actively working to recover volume from pandemic lows and in doing so improve the reliability we offer our customers. Dynamic and evolving channel demand continues to create operational complexity. We took steps earlier this year to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and to accelerate our speed to market by getting our sales teams closer to their customers. There is more to do, however, and so our work here continues. Fourth, our focus on operational excellence and disciplined cost management is especially important during periods of continued market volatility and increasing inflationary pressures. As you will hear today, we continue to be laser focused in making progress in restoring the competitiveness of our chicken segment. We are also accelerating actions across our enterprise to become more operationally excellent. Finally, we will continue to optimize our balance sheet which will give us optionality as we prioritize the delivery of shareholder value.  Turning to Slide 5, we improved our sales and earnings performance this quarter. The results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-protein, multi-channel portfolio. Sales improved 25% in third quarter and 8% year to date, reflecting the improved volumes which are up 10% for the quarter and flat year-to-date. It also reflects effective pricing strategies in all of our segments during this inflationary environment.  We delivered strong operating earnings performance resulting in approximately $1.4 billion in operating income for the quarter. This represents an 81% increase compared to prior year and translates to $2.70 in earnings per share. Our earnings reflect our three key priorities: one, to be the go-to supplier for customers and consumers; two, to be the most sought after place to work; and three, to be operationally excellent.  We want to be the most sought after place to work. This starts with an unrelenting focus on safety every minute, every shift, every day. Health and safety have been and will continue to be our top priority. We have a history of using all the tools at our disposal to protect our team members, and the vaccine is no different. As many of you will have seen, last week we announced that Tyson will require COVID-19 vaccinations for our entire U.S. workforce by November 1. We do this now because the delta variant is more contagious and getting vaccinated is the single most effective thing people can do to protect themselves, their families and their communities. We have raised wages in many markets to ensure we're competitive and are exploring other ways to make Tyson the most sought after place to work in the communities where we operate. For example, we are piloting childcare facilities at some of our plants and we have opened medical clinics to make healthcare more accessible to team members and their families. Finally, we are accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make the team members' jobs easier. We look forward to providing more detail on our automation and technology road map at our upcoming investor day. We're taking aggressive actions to add new capacity to meet demand, adjust our product mix by plant, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. We are listening to our customers and are committed to improving reliability of supply.  In the third quarter, we improved volume levels across all segments. In prepared foods, we continued to optimize our product portfolio, remove processing and supply chain complexity, and prioritize products with the highest demand, resulting in lower cost and better service to our customers. In beef, ample cattle supply, heavier animal weights and strong demand have driven volumes higher year to date. In pork, our volumes are up year to date versus pandemic lows. We are pleased to have additional capacity coming online at Eagle Mountain, Utah and Columbia, South Carolina. Both facilities are expected to grow our prepackaged beef and pork products. In chicken, volume declined year to date despite improved food service demand led by QSRs. We also saw sustained retail demand, including the frozen value-added poultry category. Limited capacity and persistent labor challenges have impacted customer fill rates in this segment; however, our new plant in Humboldt, Tennessee continues to ramp up production, including harvest capacity. This ramp-up is helping us improve customer fill rates. Chicken remains a top priority for me and for our company. We continue to execute against our road map to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range by mid fiscal '22. Our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top tier performance. We are making progress. The first imperative is to be the most sought after place to work. I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments.  The second imperative is to improve operational performance. Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of lower hatch rates on our chicken operations. We have begun to deploy new male parent stock. Where this stock has been deployed, hatch rates are improving. We expect the full roll-out of this breeder stock to be complete this fall with harvest capacity improvements occurring by mid fiscal '22.  Our rate of outside meat purchases has declined 25% versus last quarter and will continue to decline as hatch rates and utilization improve. We have identified opportunities to reduce mix complexity across our chicken footprint, which will help us operate more efficiently. The final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. We're pleased by the continued share performance of our value-added products like Tyson chicken nuggets, crispy strips and air fried. We gained share during the third quarter and the last 52 weeks. Looking ahead, we expect further growth and as a result, we're investing in line upgrades and increased capacity to drive branded product growth.  We have increased prices to help offset significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. Pricing improved nearly 16% in the quarter versus the comparable period last year. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our business, and be the best chicken company, period. Part of being customer-centric means being as efficient as possible in taking costs out where you can without compromising our ability to execute against our strategic and operational priorities. We have ongoing efforts across the business to reduce costs, but we must also find new, innovative ways to be better and stronger. This means investing in advances like automation and artificial intelligence to deliver productivity gains and competitive advantage. We have already delivered strong productivity gains in fiscal year '21. Across our business, we are looking to build upon the strength of those actions in the months and years to come, which we will detail at the investor day later this year. These improvements come at a time when we are investing heavily in capacity expansions across segments to better with our partners and meet long term demand.  I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail. Thanks Stewart. To close, our priorities are clear: being the most sought after place to work, being our customers' go-to supplier, and doing so while driving operational and functional excellence across all areas of our business. There's a lot to be excited about. We look forward to discussing where we're headed during our upcoming investor day and hope you can join us. Thank you for your interest today in Tyson Foods. Megan? Thanks for that question, Peter. Let me start with this - as we look forward, the fundamentals of our business look good going forward. We have strong retail and food service demand. We haven't changed our approach - chicken is our top priority for me and for our company. We continue to execute our plan, that hasn't changed, and that starts with staffing our plants and servicing our customers, and we have to be the most competitive chicken business, but we also want to grow the business. We are committed to top tier performance. We're committed to the 5% to 7% AOI by mid-FY22 that we talked about earlier, and we're committed to becoming the most sought after place to work, and we talked a lot about that in the prepare remarks. We've increased wages, and this includes a benefit up to $22 an hour. We've instituted flexible work schedules and shifts. We're piloting childcare and onsite health clinics for our team members and their families. We're solving transportation problems for our team members. We're investing heavily in automation and technology and trying to automate those most difficult and higher turnover jobs.  I talked last time, just so you can understand the basis of this, the seven levers of our business in chicken are price, volume, mix, labor, [indiscernible] in live, and so let me touch on each of those for a moment. In our live operations, the plan to improve hatch is well underway. The new males will be in place by this fall, as we talked about 2Q. We will see harvest capacity increase by mid-fiscal '22, so here is kind of the formula, that better hatch equals more birds, which equals more volume which equals better service which equals a better cost structure, which equals better performance and ultimately better results for us. But until then, to your point and your question, we are improving hatch and harvest volumes now. Even with these headwinds, we are better than an average company by a sizeable margin in our live production area, and we'll get sequentially better between now and mid-'22.  If I look at spend, we talked a lot last time about outside purchases, and Stewart mentioned earlier that we decreased that by 25%, although at a higher price. The thing that is challenging now is we're paying a lot of overtime because of the inefficiency associated with labor, which is absenteeism and turnover. We've had inflation on all inputs. We believe grain in our cost of goods will crest in early Q4 - in fact, it has based on the forward-looking curve. This is in our cost of goods. We've seen great improvements in our cost management and our execution by our team. Much of that has been masked by inflation. Then go to labor - labor is our single biggest issue we face, not only in chicken but also in our other businesses. We've increased wages and created flexible shifts and childcare onsite clinics. The delta variant has been a disruptor - we were on a good trajectory and then the delta variant showed up, and we've taken a step back as a result of that. We've got plans to mitigate that, but the health and safety of our team members is our highest priority. We are more inefficient than we have historically been, certainly a big part of what we have to solve, but essentially it takes us six days to get five days' worth of work. I will tell you that execution has improved sequentially through the year.  Our volumes' up in the quarter. [Indiscernible] as our finished good sales. Volume is negatively impacted by harvesting below plan, which we've talked about, as a result of hatch. We started this year with a plan to grow the business and grow our head and grow our sales, but our by-product and export sales are our biggest misses from a volume perspective. We will see volume increase between now and mid-'22 - that's in hatch, that's in head harvest, and that's in volume to our plants.  From a mix standpoint, we've added volume. Value-added volume is very strong - that's ready-to-eat product, that's par fry product, that's our frozen value-added branded products. That's the heart and soul of our business in chicken. We are at capacity with strong retail and food service demand. As Stewart referenced earlier, we're adding lines and plants to address very strong demand.  Our pricing is up 16% in the quarter. Most of this increase came in June and even more in July. We worked with our customers and they've been very responsive. Our relationships are very strong with our customers. We've been successful in getting pricing. Grain also at the same time has continued to escalate and pricing will certainly lag the cost in this scenario. We're just simply asking for fair market value for these products. Long story short, we are executing better, we are performing better. We have a great deal of inflation led by grain, but we've gotten pricing around and so as we move into every month and quarter from here, I would expect us to be sequentially better, and that 5% to 7% that we talked about by mid-'22, we're committed to that and we stand with that number. Good morning. Sure, thanks Ken. As you know, we talked about the fact that this would be phased in starting and completing by, let's call it fall. That work is underway, and we have converted some of the male stock and we've seen some results associated with that. Everything we have seen thus far would be in line with what we expected, and we see no reason to expect any disruption from that. From that standpoint, everything looks good. It looks like it's on track to deliver what the--the timing that we've talked about thus far. You bet, Ken. Let me say this, and I think your view of beef, where we had ample cattle supplies and where we had really strong demand, we were constricted in the middle based on labor availability. I talked about this in chicken earlier, but in our beef business it essentially takes us six days to get five days' worth of work, so the inefficiency associated with that allowed cattle to back up on the ranch and in feed lots. Here's what we know as we look into '22. Fed supplies are expected to be down about half a percent, June cattle on feed is projected to be up 1.9%. There has been some herd liquidation in the west and northern plains, which according to Cattlefacts is about 33% of the U.S. cow calf production is in this drought area, but '22 is looking good. Is it going to be at the same level at which we were--where we are in '21? Probably not, I don't think it will be that good. I think it will be better than historical returns, and I'm talking that 1% to 3% which we've talked about forever. It'll be north of that, we think, but we think all in all beef will have a very nice year in '22.  In terms of exports, to the other part of your question, Asian growth is still solid. U.S. grain fed beef is preferred around the world and, as you mentioned, key global beef suppliers are rebuilding herds in Australia, Brazil and Canada, so all of that is true, so strong export demand for us as well as domestic. Thank you. Yes, that's a great question, Ben. We're still very proud of our prepared foods business, and if I look at the detail behind this, demand is expected to remain elevated. Retail orders, for example, are up 30% versus pre-COVID levels. Food service is showing a sequential improvement as well. We have seen accelerating and unprecedented inflation, so what do you do about that? Well, we have significant food service pricing already in the market. Retail pricing will be in the market by September 5. Inflation is up about 14% during our 3Q and 9% year-to-date. We've had--just like other businesses, we've had labor and absenteeism and turnover in the business, we have a number of open positions, so that certainly has made us inefficient, and so we've got aggressive pricing going on. Aggressive revenue management and commercial spend management will help mitigate a portion of these inflationary impacts. We'll have to get more price, but we're comfortable that over time that our prepared foods is a double-digit business for us, and it's just costs are hitting us faster that we can get pricing at this point. Thanks Robert. What you've said--I mean, you quoted everything I said earlier, but with retail with the branded portfolio, it can take a little bit longer to get pricing in. We typically don't disclose that kind of information about when we'd do it, but here's generally the way we think about this, is that when raw materials--when inputs go up, pricing has to go up, particularly in an environment where we have such rapid and accelerating inflation. We have little choice but to go and to--we certainly have to be competitive, but we certainly have to get pricing to cover the increase in inputs, and we're doing that and we're doing that very methodically. We're looking at all the metrics around that as we do that, but we're doing it in a very responsible way. Noelle O'Mara and her team are managing that around the clock. Well food service, from everyone I've talked to, based on what we see from a demand perspective is very strong. We're at or near across all businesses, and some are even above from food service, from let's call it pre-COVID levels in '19. I don't know that anyone fully understands what's going to happen with the delta variant, and there is certainly some concern about that; but everyone I talk to in food service is optimistic about the future and for their businesses in particular. Sure, thank you Ben. As we've talked a lot, even in our prepared remarks today but they didn't just start today, the health and safety of our team is our highest priority. If you go back and look even in the beginnings of the pandemic, Tyson did a number of things to protect our team members; in fact, I would tell you we did everything we knew to do to protect our team members, that was our highest priority, to mask mandates to barriers within plants to social distancing to staggering shifts to temperature sensors and health screenings prior to going to work every day. We did everything that we knew to do. With the new vaccine, it's a new tool. We believe that vaccine is the most effective thing, the most effective tool available today. We've studied the data, we've researched it to the nth degree, and we're confident in doing that, and so we mandated that because we thought it would be irresponsible not to do that and irresponsible not to protect our team members in every way that we could.  Now there could be some short term impacts, but I think they certainly will be offset by long term benefit in doing this, so that's the position that we have taken. It's out of just an abundance of caution and care for our team members. Yes, great question Ben. A couple things with respect to that. When we started fiscal '21, we had plans in place to increase our harvest head based on capacity utilization, based on demand that we already had, and with the hatch issues, certainly that created a shortfall in terms of head for our business, and then we'd go outside and start buying. As we have changed this male out and we are starting to see results of that, that will ultimately end up in more head for us to harvest, which is exactly our plan to--we already have that product sold, but I would expect as we move into '22 and beyond, that you'll see our capacity utilization increase at Tyson from a harvest perspective, and all that will be in service to supporting our value-added branded portfolio. Thank you. Good morning. Sure Adam, I think you described it very well and in a lot of ways even answered this. You talked about based on what you saw, that it was 84%. Well, obviously 84% capacity utilization in a protein business is not a good number - we acknowledge that. It certainly has cost implications for your product and in fact can keep you uncompetitive in that space, so we acknowledge that. There is a number of--we need a number of head, you can do the math on how much outside meat we're purchasing based on volume, and you could probably convert that to head. I mean, one of the things that we could--the quick math would tell you is that being able to run those products through our plants and being able to debone those chickens and go into our further processed assets, and at the same time get credit for all the by-products through the ingredient solution group and then have the ability with our One Tyson approach to being able to sell export leg quarters and paws and so forth, along with just the further processing volume increases that we would get, all of that adds up to a much better cost scenario and a much better performance in our chicken business. Yes, great question Adam. As we look at Prop 12, it's about 4% of total production - that's not significant for us today. Tyson is currently aligning and incentivizing suppliers where appropriate. We can do multiple programs simultaneously, including Prop 12, so it's not something we're excited about but we can align suppliers and we can certainly provide the raw material to service our customers in that way. Good morning Alexia. There is a pretty significant increase and a pretty significant cost increase associated with that, but in a lot of respects the market is doing its job. Based on availability of labor as being in shorter supply, it's going up and I don't see any reduction in that. We believe we're in a good place. We believe we are at the top of the market, if you will, in terms of jobs similar to this. We certainly are very competitive in all the communities where we have assets producing protein, so we're comfortable with where we are but it certainly has increased.  But in order to get people into your production location, it's more than just wage. I want to make that clear. We have to do other things, and I outlined a number of those things that we're doing around childcare, transportation, onsite clinics, providing a safe place to work, flexible shifts and number of shifts in a week. It's a combination of all those things and doing all those things well, so when you hear us talk about being the most sought after place to work, those are the type of things that we have to do in order to be able to service our customers and grow our business. Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We hope you and your families stay healthy and safe, and we'll look forward to speaking again soon. Have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Megan Britt of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMegan Britt: Hello, and welcome to the second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call for Tyson Foods. On the call today are Dean Banks, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donnie King, Group President Poultry & Chief Operating Officer; and Stewart Glendinning, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our comments, which are available on the Investor Relations section of the Tyson website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which may cause actual results to differ materially from our current projections. Please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on slide two, as well as our SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections. Please note that references on earnings per share, operating income and operating margin in our remarks are on an adjusted basis unless otherwise noted. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release. I'll now turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Banks: Thank you, Megan. Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Donnie King to the earnings call and congratulate him on his recent promotion to Chief Operating Officer. I would also like to thank our 140,000 team members for their continued efforts and resilience. They are what makes this company an incredible place to work, and I'm proud of their focus on raising the world's expectations for how much good food can do. Earlier today, we released our second quarter results for fiscal 2021. We delivered a solid operating earnings performance recording $739 million in adjusted operating income for the quarter, which represents a 43% increase relative to the same period last year. We delivered $1.34 in adjusted earnings per share, a 68% increase from the same period last year. These results were reinforced by our solid performance in retail, our continuing efforts to ensure the safety of our team members, our partnership with customers to enable recovery and our focused execution to overcome inflationary headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect our continued focus on team member health and safety. This is our top priority, and I'm proud of the progress that we've made on our comprehensive safety, health and wellness agenda, along with our recent vaccine deployment efforts. We also saw improvement in the foodservice channel during the quarter. We've been working closely with our customers to support foodservice recovery. As consumer demand patterns continue to create operational complexities, we've taken action to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and customer needs to accelerate our speed to market. Agility is increasingly important as we look to extend the gains that we have achieved in the retail channel. We continue to drive retail volume growth across our core business lines, delivering growth in the recent quarter is particularly notable as we are now comparing to a prior quarter that included some benefit from initial COVID-19 pantry loading. As we navigate market volatility and rising inflationary pressures, we're focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. Our balance sheet is strong, and we continue to invest in our business. We have prioritized capacity expansion and automation technology investments, and have significantly increased our capital allocated to both of these areas. As an example, our Humboldt production facility in Tennessee has recently commenced operations and our team shipped the first saleable product in late April. To support growth in case-ready beef and pork, we were also excited for the reopening of our Columbia South Carolina plant, as well as the grand opening of our Eagle Mountain, Utah plant, both occurring later this year. We are expanding capacity in our international operations and have six sites where new capacity is currently under construction, positioning our international business for continued growth and profitability in the future. As we look at the balance of the year, we realized that we have a challenging second half ahead as inflationary pressure has continued to build. We also have several price spots, notably our performance in the retail channel and the continued strength in our Beef segment. Looking past the inflationary headwinds that are impacting our input costs, I'm confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value creation. Turning to Slide 4. Team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. Through our partnership with Matrix Medical and our local communities, over 42,000 of our team members have been vaccinated since February. As of today, we've offered onsite vaccination clinics at over 100 locations in more than 30 states. We've also launched a pilot project to enhance health and wellness of our team members. This involves the opening of seven clinics that will enable team members and their families to receive easier access to high-quality healthcare services. Our first facility opened recently in Newbern, Tennessee. Turning now to Slide 5. Our total Tyson and Core Business Lines have posted 11 consecutive quarters of volume and share growth. Notably, our team delivered volume growth in Q2, despite the unusually strong demand associated with pantry loading that occurred during the comparable quarter last year. Sales volume for Tyson Core Business Lines are up 12.7%. In total, Tyson is up 8.5% in the latest 52 weeks. Our share growth has been the strongest in breakfast, sausage, hotdogs, frozen value-added poultry and frozen protein breakfast. Our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our brand and product lines. Total Tyson household penetration reached 81% for the latest 52 weeks. Also consumers continue to rely on low to no contact buying methods. As a result, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 105% in the latest 13 weeks compared with last year. This equated to approximately $425 million of sales through our e-commerce channel partners. Turning to Slide 6. Innovation is important to our success in both retail and foodservice channels, and we continue to invest in the launch and scaling of new product innovations. On this slide, we have three examples of how our product innovation is tied to meaningful consumer insights. In a recent survey, nearly half of Americans expressed dissatisfaction with available plant-based options for the grill. This insight spurred our recent nationwide Raised & Rooted launch, which includes three new products to meet increasing demand for plant-based protein options. We're also excited for our recent launch of alternative protein offerings in the Europe and Asia-Pacific markets, which will support growing global demand for protein. For Jimmy Dean Breakfast Nuggets are another example of our ability to pair brand and category leadership in frozen breakfast with our unique production capabilities to deliver protein dense offerings that complement Tyson's current product portfolio. Finally, annual servings per capita for breaded chicken sandwiches at restaurants are up 14%. And our products in this space have enabled us to capitalize on the growing popularity. Moving to Slide 7. As we continue to navigate complex consumer dynamics overall, we're closely monitoring several factors to effectively engage with our customers and consumers in support of the overall recovery. Protein has remained relevant throughout the pandemic, with 54% of consumers indicating a deliberate intent to increase protein intake within their daily diet and 20% indicating that they are consuming animal protein more often than they were a year ago. In addition to overall protein consumption, we are closely monitoring reopening and recovery patterns. Approximately 76% of the U.S. states are now at 75% or more capacity for in-restaurant dining. With vaccine rollouts and consumer mobility improving, away from home traffic is gradually increasing on a sequential basis. Currently QSR and C-stores are leading the recovery as consumers are very comfortable with ordering takeout. While we are seeing some challenges in our international markets, progress against COVID domestically should continue to improve consumer confidence and mobility in the second half. The U.S. economy is improving rapidly in part due to government stimulus. But we expect some degree of elevated retail consumption to remain post-COVID, our success in growing retail share and driving relevant innovation will allow us to meet the strong demand for protein and serve our customers across all channels. I'll now turn the call over to Donnie to walk us through the segment operating results in detail.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Dean. I will start with the Chicken segment performance captured on Slide 8. Sales were $3.6 billion for the second quarter, up 5%. Overall volumes were down in the quarter, primarily due to COVID-related production inefficiencies. Severe winter weather also impacted volumes, operating costs and production efficiencies in the quarter. Average sales price was up substantially during the period due to the favorable mix and the benefit of higher retail volume. Our reported price improvement also reflects actions that we've taken to cover the inflationary pressure we have experienced from higher grain, labor and freight costs. Despite our efforts in the quarter, we did not fully offset the inflationary impacts as a substantial portion of our business is contracted on a fixed annual price basis. The terms negotiated and locked ahead of the recent surge in grain cost. Adjusted operating income was $6 million during the second quarter and $110 million for the fiscal year-to-date, down versus both comparable periods. Fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $145 million of higher feed ingredient costs, as well as $95 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. For the second quarter feed ingredients were $135 million higher. Our grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases were $60 million higher. Segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the second quarter of $40 million and $110 million for the fiscal year to-date, both versus the respective comparable periods. These gains are associated with realized gains, as well as open positions. Last quarter, we shared our imperatives for improving Chicken operating results, which are captured on Slide 9. Our goal has not changed. We remain committed to restoring top tier performance. The first imperative is related to being the employer of choice. Despite implementing pay rate increases, we continue to deal with elevated absenteeism and turnover. We're implementing a range of initiatives to improve the team member experience and achieve the status of the employer of choice, including flexible work schedules and a competitive wage rate. At this time, we estimate our average base pay plus benefits for domestic productions -- production workers is valued at over $22 per hour. The second imperative relates to our strategy to improve overall operational performance. Although, we have made some progress improving our plant performance, we're not where we plan to be at this stage. Our strategy to improve our operation performance includes restoring our production volume to full capacity. However, we've struggled to raise the harvest to full capacity due to upstream supply issues, including issues caused by lower hatchability rights. Consequently, we have offset raw material shortages with outside meat purchases at a higher level than we have historically, with the recent move in market prices are cost disadvantage from outside purchases has wide. To compensate for cost headwind, we are working to recover our historical advantage on live costs, reduce the number of pounds we're sourcing in the open market and to increase our plant efficiency as we gradually store volume over the balance of the year. The final imperative relates to serving our customers. Our focus is to deliver the highest levels of service to our customers too with respect to order fill rates. When our customers are successful, we are successful. We are sustaining share gains in retail value added as we start to lap the COVID-19 surge and are also leading foodservice recovery and growth. At the same time, our sales team is working to recover raw material and supply chain cost inflation via pricing. To sum all of these imperatives is a restoration of our Chicken business to top tier competitiveness and the coveted position of being our customer's go to supplier. Acknowledging the uncertainty associated with continued COVID-19 recovery, we are increasingly confident in our ability to bring our adjusted operating income margin back to at least 5% to 7% range over time. Moving to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.2 billion for the quarter, up 4% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down 4% in the quarter as growth in the retail channel was offset by reduction in foodservice volumes. Sales growth outpaced volume growth, driven by the partial pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending and better sales mix. Segment operating income was $217 million for the quarter, up 14% versus prior year. For the first half, operating income was $483 million, up 30%. Operating margins for the segment were 10% for the second quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the comparable period. Improvement in operating income was driven by the mixed benefit of strong retail performance, lower commercial spending and pricing pass-throughs, which more than offset higher operating and raw material costs. In the second half, demand is expected to remain elevated at retail, with volumes continuing to exceed pre-COVID levels and foodservice showing sequential improvement. Overall, we're seeing an accelerating inflationary environment that is creating a meaningful headwind for Prepared Foods in the back half of the year. We're seeing raw material cost up over 15%, as well as increases in logistics, packaging, and labor. To offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management, commercial spend optimization, while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. Moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 2% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included a strong domestic and export demand for beef products, with average sales price up 7.5% for the quarter. Sales volume for the quarter was down due to the severe winter weather and production inefficiencies related to the challenging labor environment. Segment operating income was $445 million for the quarter. Operating income improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Operating margins for the segment improved 790 basis points to 11% for the second quarter. Our Beef segment performance has been driven by a favorable supply and demand dynamics, which looked to persist deeper into the year. On beef supply, slightly higher domestic production for the calendar year is being more than offset by lower imports and higher exports, resulting in lower projected domestic availability for the full year. Adequate supply coupled with continued strong domestic and export demand will sustain cutout values and our strong segment results. Now, let's move on to Pork segment on Slide 12. Second quarter results reflect the benefit of strong retail demand and higher exports, which were more than offset by higher hog cost and operating expenses. Segment sales were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 17% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to stronger demand, partially offset by lower volumes due to production inefficiencies. Average sales price increased by over 17%, while volumes were down slightly relative to the same period last year. Segment adjusted operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 28% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined by 280 basis points to 4.5% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by lower volumes, higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. To improve our operating income results for the segment, we have implemented several actions to alleviate production constraints and to improve our volume throughput. As we look ahead, we're closely monitoring hog supply estimates. Recent USDA projections show a historically sharp drop in hog supplies. The sharp decline in supply and strong demand for certain pork items have pushed the cutout up 59% from the end of December. As it stands now, pork cutout is at the highest level for this time of year since 2014. Looking at the overall calendar year, lower projected 2021 pork production and continued robust consumer demand are expected to support hog prices at well above 2020 levels. Slide 13 captures some highlights related to our international business. We continue to invest behind our international platform, which provides an opportunity to grow our sales and our margin by leveraging global production capabilities to feed consumers abroad. We're using our One Tyson framework to identify opportunities to maximize the value of our products and capabilities from farm to table at a global level. Our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships creates the right recipe for growth and positions us with the right to win internationally. I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to provide additional detail on our financial performance.\nStewart Glendinning: Thanks Donnie. Turning now to a summary of our total company financial results, we are pleased with year-over-year growth in sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. We performed well despite the challenging operating environment that expend tough labor availability, significant inflationary pressures in raw material costs, global supply chain challenges and evolving demand backdrop. Adjusted operating income was up 43% during the second quarter due to strong performance in our Beef business, along with growth in Prepared Foods earnings, partially offset by softness in Chicken and Pork. For the first half of fiscal 2021, we delivered adjusted operating income growth of 32%. Adjusted EPS grew nearly 70% during the second quarter driven by higher operating income. Fiscal year-to-date adjusted EPS was up 41% on year-to-date basis. Slide 15 bridges our total company sales for the first half. Ongoing retail strength drove much of our sales results. We delivered growth across all our reporting segments in the retail channel. Overall, retail accounted for $700 million in sales improvement during the first half and over $260 million in the second quarter versus comparable periods. Moving to foodservice. Sales declined over $400 million in the first half compared to the same period last year, but improved $69 million in the second quarter. Foodservice recovery was most evident during the second quarter in higher Chicken and Prepared Foods sales versus the same period last year. Our foodservice mix in Chicken indexes to QSRs, which saw volumes above pre-COVID levels during the period. In Prepared Foods, we are seeing recovery in foodservice foot traffic and strong sales into the distribution channel. Exports were up over 5% versus the comparable period, led by Beef where sales improved nearly $100 million for the first half. China is a key driver of Beef export strength. Lastly, we've seen some strength in industrial, particularly in Pork as renewable fuels continue to drive growth in fat and oils demand. In addition, the pace and shape of foodservice recovery will affect the composition of our channel and segment sales in the second half of the fiscal year. Slide 16 shows the bridge for adjusted operating income for the first half. Lower volumes, primarily from production inefficiencies in foodservice were $100 million headwind on gross margin in the first half. Price mix benefited during the first half from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong Beef segment performance, and continued retail strength across segments. Adjusted operating income was burdened by $664 million in cost of goods sold pressure for the period. This amount reflects significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. Of the total, feed ingredients, scrub costs and outside meat purchases associated with the Chicken segment contributed $240 million of pressure. Other large contributors included freight and labor costs. Year-to-date SG&A benefited from the $54 million loss in fiscal 2020 compared to a $55 million gain in fiscal 2021 associated with the cattle supplier fraud and certain reductions in trade spin and travel costs. Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Given continued strength in the Beef segment and our expectations for ongoing foodservice recovery, we are raising our sales guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $44 billion to $46 billion. This guidance reflects our expectation of partial price recovery relative to continued feed ingredient and supply chain cost inflation. At the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance of lower operating margins in Chicken and Pork versus the prior year to hold. Because of stronger than expected performance in Beef and current market conditions, we are raising our guidance on the Beef segment. We now expect segment earnings to be up versus prior year. Finally, we are lowering our guidance in Prepared Foods due to back-off inflationary pressures, and now expect the segments earnings to be flat versus the prior year. Key risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor costs, grain costs in the Chicken segment; raw material costs for our Prepared Foods business and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meets. Our capital expenditures outlook of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion remains unchanged, but we now expect to be at the lower end of the range. Net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $420 million. This update reflects an incremental term loan repayment of $750 million relative to our prior guidance that resulted in the early payoff of our $1.5 billion term loan offset by $500 million of new indebtedness associated with a new bilateral term loan facility. Our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged. We will continue to monitor the potential implications of any new legislation, but do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year. Our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged. As we noted last quarter, liquidity decreased from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, ending the second quarter at $2.6 billion. Finally, our COVID-related costs, which totaled $95 million in the quarter, and now expected to be approximately $365 million for the year. Turning to Slide 18. With our strong operational performance through the first half of 2021, we've seen an increase in operating cash flows. We have prioritized deleveraging through the first half, consistent with our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility. Investing organically in our business has been an important priority, which will increase our production capacity and our market capabilities, as well as modernize our operations, while providing strong returns. We will continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through M&A. We have a disciplined approach which focuses on returns and generation of shareholder value. Finally, we're committed to return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In short, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business is both strong and diverse, and we expect our deployment to deliver strong shareholder return. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Dean.\nDean Banks: Thanks Stewart. To close our prepared remarks, I just want to make a few comments about our priorities for the second half. Looking at the work ahead of us, we are focused on improving operating margins, growing above the market and driving sustainable return for shareholders. To improve our operating margins, we are driving enterprise-wide operational excellence, working aggressively to restore our competitive position in our Chicken segment and structuring our teams to operate at the speed of the market. To grow above the market, our team is focused on working closely with our customers to enable foodservice recovery and support ongoing retail demand. We've also increased investment in value-added capacity expansions in automation technology, which will support increased sales, high efficiency processing, and more agile customer service. Lastly, the strength of our balance sheet will allow us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders consistent with our stated priorities. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Megan.\nMegan Britt: Thanks, Dean. We will now move onto your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Hey, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. So, maybe, Donnie, that's one for you. Just wanted to follow-up on the initiatives within Chicken, and I mean, clearly, you've laid out very much detailed the plan on how to work on improving and get back to that mid to \u2013 mid-single-digit, high single-digit operating income margin level. Now, more short-term, if we take a look at the cost headwinds, corn, soy, I mean, obviously, that's significantly impacting. How do you feel about your ability to negotiate on pricing with what you usually have on your negotiators and contract pricing with customers, just considering that the overall environment seems to be very inflationary? So do you have -- do you see any flexibility around the pricing mechanisms in the short-term? Thank you.\nDonnie King: Thanks for the question. Short answer is, yes. We have, obviously, locked in some pricing early, before we saw the run-up in grain. But we've been having non-stop conversations with all of our customers around the inflationary need for pricing. And they have been very responsive. We've had a lot of really good results in -- let's call it mid contract going and having a conversation with those customers. Remember our relationships with our customers, it is a relationship. It is not a transactional event for us and we've invested as they have through the years. And so, they've been very supportive. They certainly understand the inflationary needs and I think we will be quite successful in this endeavor.\nBen Theurer: Okay. Perfect. And just to kind of look ahead, I mean, where do you think are low-hanging fruits in terms of operating efficiencies to bring margins back up aside from the headwinds, like really what's in your hand? What have you identified since you took over a more serious review of the business a couple of months ago? And where do you think are the low-hanging fruits and more the bigger challenges, just to bring that back to that 5% to 7% margin range you've talked about?\nDonnie King: Sure. Well, let me start with -- as we started the fiscal year, we had one objective and that was to simply be the best chicken company as we move forward. And we obviously recognize that's not where we were and -- or where we are. And so, we began to work on that. And as we get into -- as we got into this, we started seeing good results, particularly in Q1. However, in January, we started -- the recovery slowed down, driven by volume constraints due primarily to chick availability from an unexpected decline in hatch. The winter storm Uri affected our operations broadly, a significant event. We essentially lost a week across our entire poultry enterprise and more broadly across the rest of the businesses as well. As a result of these supply shortages, we compensated with outside meat purchases, which has driven our cost up as market price rallied sharply, particularly after the first quarter. At the same time, costs inflation accelerated with the grain, the highest in the last six years, wage increases and freight costs also impacted us. And as I mentioned earlier, we contracted a large share of our portfolio in the fall and early winter before the prices began to increase materially. We're continuing to deal with turnover and absenteeism. And -- but what I would tell you, despite these headwinds, the fundamentals of our business looking forward are actually quite good. Customer and consumer demand is strong, sustained demand in retail and foodservice recovery with ongoing chicken sandwich promotions. So the outlook and alongside the operational improvements that we're making and the pricing opportunities that we have are quite good. So -- but very specifically, I think about this business and the seven levers that this business or this business model and the levers are price. We simply need to be -- to get paid fair market value. We certainly can't eat all the inflation that we're experiencing now. We've got to get volume back under us. Our business is growing, and we got to get the harvest numbers back up for our business. And we have to continue to get more FP capacity online. We've had a great improvement in mix. We're still struggling with absenteeism. And then, we need to make sure our spend is imbalanced with the volume at which we're processing. And finally, we need to return our live production, spreads -- our historical spread to the industry, we need to regain those spreads. So, what I can tell you is, we know where we are really, and we're not happy with where we are. And we fully understand that we can't talk our way through our poor performance. We do have a great plan in place to be the best chicken company, and we've made great progress. And we'll accelerate that in the back half of the year. I'll tell you, we have a great team in place. Everybody knows what they're doing. And we're not afraid. We're not discouraged. We're a little bit delayed from the -- some of the winter and some of the activities inflation in Q2. But we're very optimistic about this business as we move forward.\nDean Banks: And I just want to add just a compliment to Donnie and the team, we'd committed in previous calls to have visible operating metric improvement at the end of the second quarter. And from everything we've seen early in the quarter and coming out of the previous year, we had seen those operating improvements materializing. It's unfortunate that we're experiencing all the headwinds, but I'm proud of how Donnie and the team is managing those headwinds and the operating improvements they made, which will become visible, as we navigate the headwinds coming forward.\nBen Theurer: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much, Donnie, Dean for the comments. Congrats.\nDonnie King: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. Good morning.\nDean Banks: Good morning.\nKen Goldman: I wanted to make sure I understood guidance. When you say that the results in a particular segment are likely to be higher or lower than the prior year, I think you're talking about operating margin, because that's what it says in the slide, and that's what you've historically done. But in your prepared remarks, I thought you said profit or earnings. I just wanted to clarify whether it's margin or earnings or both when you're talking about those terms.\nStewart Glendinning: Yeah. Ken, Stewart here. Absolutely. It's percentage with some of our rate of return on sales and as you point out that -- that's what you see in the slide.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thank you for that. And then, as a quick follow-up, can you talk a little bit about some of those hatch issues that you mentioned. How structural are those? How much of those related or related to some of the weather that we saw? I'm just trying to get a sense of your outlook for those.\nDean Banks: Sure. Great question. We think some of them are structural in that -- in our program. We changed one of the males that we were using in our business and great brawler performance. But we're not seeing the -- those maternal characteristics, such as egg production and hatch, namely hatch. And so, we've got some of those issues going on. But in terms of the weather, it's a little hard in February, with the Uri, with the impact of that with all the power outages and so forth. We had eggs sitting on a farm without power. So, we saw a loss of embryos as a result of that. So, from February into March, think about this -- those animals that were -- those chicks that were impacted also went through the grow-out cycle and they had issues as they went through there. So, the initial impact was very expensive. But you think about the knock-on effects of that. It's -- those persisted all the way through April and we're just now clearing ourselves to that. But the other side of this, or the view of this is, they are -- in terms of the hatchet is improving. It will improve marginally as we move over, as we elevate -- if you think about our business and our breeder performance, we have a spread from the best to the worst. So just elevating and tightening that spread will give us improvement. Seasonally, we'll get a little bit of improvement. And the knock-on effects from the winter storm will give us a little improvement. So, we're not going to be all the way bright. It'll take us time to work the males that we're changing at. We'll have a new male in place everywhere. Let's call it, Ball and -- but it'll take a full year to see this come back to bright. But we're competent in that. And so that's where we are.\nKen Goldman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nDean Banks: Good morning.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. So, two questions from me. The first one you talked about operational inefficiencies. I was just wondering if you could clarify what those problems were, and how quickly you expect them to be resolved? And then I have a follow-up.\nDean Banks: Thanks. Great question. In terms of the issue, it's -- think of it in terms of a staffing issue impacting capacity. If I think about our Pork business, it's been taking us about six days to do five days\u2019 worth of work, because of turnover absenteeism. The other part of that is in terms of the performance is related to not having skilled people in place. And so, we've not been able to get mix optimization in terms of maximizing the cutout, all those variety meats, all those components that are highly attractive from a margin perspective. We're short-staffed right now in our pork plant. We're working on things that you might would expect in terms of work schedules. We're looking at wages in all those cases, and we're also investing in terms of automation and technology to try to alleviate these more difficult and higher turnover jobs.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And then as a follow-up, could you give us a quick sort of update on the current status of the African swine fever situation in China? Is that -- we didn't hear anything about that this time around? I know that you think that it's probably going to continue to have an impact on the global meat supply and demand balance for some time. But are we getting through to the other side of that, so that it's having less of an impact on your export business, for example?\nDean Banks: Yeah. So, first off, the case is not just in China, but what we've seen in Germany, it really disrupted global protein flows. Some of the protein was obviously destined for Asia. China, early reports, where they were having some success of repopulating, but our latest research shows that that's really not happening anywhere near the pace that they hope. So, we still see really strong exports going into China to cover that gap.\nAlexia Howard: Right.\nDonnie King: I would add -- okay, I would add to that just that China is still at the -- at important deficit. There are new heard losses from ASF, which is slowing their recovery. So, based on the numbers, I saw quoted from Rabobank recently, there'll be flat to about 2020.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nDean Banks: Good morning, Adam.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson: Wanted to -- maybe tie together some of the comments that you've given on the Chicken business through the call already. As we think about the balance of this fiscal year and that kind of pathway that -- to that 5% to 7% margins. Maybe can you help us think about where we would be kind of at the end of September, at the end of fiscal 2021 in terms of some of the live productivity issues where you'd hope to be from a labor and nutrition perspective, kind of where you think you'll be on kind of price versus feed, kind of balance by the end of the fiscal year and the 5% to 7%? Just help us think about -- you talked about it as a medium-term target, what do you think the timeline realistically is to get back there?\nDean Banks: Sure. So, as I think about the -- let's start with the hatch issue. I covered off on a number of those things in terms of it'll be improving sequentially, but we're changing out of male that -- quite frankly, we made a bad decision on and will not be all the way bright until -- let's call it, mid-year of 2022. But we'll sequentially get better between now and then, and hatch. That'll help us supply and supply that we quite frankly need today. We're too dependent on the outside purchases meat right now. And we've -- the market has run up in there. So it's -- the ability to pass on that cost in the marketplace is next to impossible. And so, we need to get our own animals in place. And by the way, that outside purchase is predominantly breast meat and that we have good sales for the back half of the chicken, all the rendered products that come with that, of course, you see the wing bar are well over -- that are over three bucks right now. But in terms of getting to the 5% to 7%, and when I say 5% to 7%, I'm talking about 5% to 7% and business that's growing, growing top line, growing bottom line. And so, we got to staff the plans. I mean, that's an imperative here. And we have to compete with the very best and competing in this example is we need to have a cost structure that is best-in-class. And quite frankly, we haven't had that. And -- but we're well on the road. We have -- much like we did in 2008, we have a path forward. We're looking at those big rocks. Most of them would be in labor yield spin. Volume is certainly a big component of that as well. And we've got to service customers better. Quite honestly, we have not serviced our customers well in almost -- well, two and a half years. I talked about the SAP cutover and then COVID of last year. And so, we got to do that better for our customers. And that certainly helps us. And then that puts us in a position to continue to grow our business. We're being very successful right now with growth in the business. And when we service the customer in full, all the time across all channels, then we get the opportunity to grow our business at even a higher rate. So, all those things are -- all those things that would get you to the 5% to 7% and growing. But it's the fundamentals. It's the fundamentals of the business that we have to get in order. And we're very much aware of those. We're very much aware of where our gaps are to each one of those cost components. And so -- and we've got a good team working on it. So, more to come.\nDonnie King: One other point I wanted to make related to the hatch issue is that, it's a bit of a double-edged sword and that not only are we buying a protein in the market to service our further process customers, but in the primary processing, our plant's not running full as some deleveraging. And so, you'll see us in the coming quarters, as we get hatch fixed, we increased capacity in our facilities. We'll absorb some of that deleveraging and get back to operating metrics and operating performance that come alongside that.\nAdam Samuelson: All right. That color is really helpful. And then maybe a follow-up question, maybe this is for Stewart. Just thinking on the capital allocation front, Tyson -- you're at your kind of long-term, kind of leverage target at two-times at the end of the second quarter. Maybe just help us think about kind of deploying incremental cash flow from here. And I think in your prepared remarks, I think -- any reference to M&A that was interested in kind of -- was talked about optimize the portfolio, didn't seem kind of to have aspirations for a lot of offensive M&A. But maybe just to help us think about cash deployment from here.\nDean Banks: Yeah. Sure. Well, look, I mean, I'll tell you. I feel really pretty good about -- our options here. If you think about our capital allocation in three big planks. First, we've been focused on building financial strength and that certainly true as you pointed out our debt to EBITDA ratio is looking good. We do have more debt coming due later this year. And, of course, we have a term loan that's outstanding. So, there's about $1 billion between those two. Then, think about investing in the business. M&A is opportunistic, but, of course, we have and will continue to be pretty disciplined there from a return standpoint. Where you have seen increased capital deployment has been around CapEx, we did earlier this year guide that we would be as high as $1.5 billion. We haven't been able to get some of the projects away as quickly as we've wanted, but you might take away from that early guidance that we have an appetite to invest behind our company in organic kinds of investments. And there are lots of strong opportunities in automation and another profit improvement areas in our business, and notably, lots of opportunity for us to invest in new capacity in our business. And we've got a number of new plants that are coming online. In the prepared remarks we talked about six different sites in our international business, wherever we're investing in new capacity. Donnie spoke about a couple of new plants coming online in the U.S., Humboldt has come online. So, more capital is going against capacity and then as needed for growing business. And then, lastly, of course, 10 years of building growth, we have not been shy to share that cash for shareholders, and we expect to continue to do that in the future. So, I think step back, we've got a well thought out, well balanced approach to capital allocation.\nAdam Samuelson: All right. I appreciate all that color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey. Good morning, everybody.\nDean Banks: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: Want to ask about the Prepared Foods segment. Your commentary makes perfect sense, just given the raw material cost inflation that we've seen. I'd love to hear some commentary on the cadence of pricing that you expect to realize. What you're looking at from a competitive standpoint and demand elasticity standpoint in that business? And how we should be thinking about kind of the realization of margin recovery in that business relative to raw material costs and pricing increases.\nDean Banks: Sure. I'll take first shot at this and then pass it over. But we still see tremendous continued retail strength in Prepared Foods and with 11 straight quarters of growth in our core business lines, we're able to command a strong presence there. And as it relates to pricing, we are probably experiencing high input costs from the Pork business. And that will ultimately get passed along. Most of our pricing -- in retail, specifically, we're in a position where we interact with our partner customers quite frequently, and they see what we're experiencing there and we're able to pass that on. We are -- we do expect in the next half to be increasing that spend. It's going to be a requirement obviously to remain competitive in the marketplace. Those investments have paid off in the past, taking against -- as you read and heard 81% household penetration, that's something that we can leverage long-term. In Prepared Foods, the other thing to really keep in mind is that foodservice is coming back. So, we've mentioned that 75% of the areas, which we cover are recovered at about 75%. While we've seen about a 10% dropout in restaurants, those are getting back-filled with those kitchens and a variety of other creative models that -- and ultimately, addition of restaurants to fill that void. We think that that business is going to recover strong. It's a lower margin business. So, we'll see that balancing out, not only due to throughput in the restaurants, but also channel filling, as we get prepared for the full recovery. And last thing I mentioned about foodservice is that please keep in mind, it's obviously regional and it's very different across channels. So, clearly, we've not seen a recovery in K-12 [ph] that we'd expected. And some areas of the world that impact our business, specifically in Europe, they -- they're still buckling under the pressures of COVID. So, foodservice hasn\u2019t recovered quite as much as we'd want. So with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Stewart to talk about margin outlook.\nStewartGlendinning: Yeah. Look, the only thing I would add to what Dean has said is that our expectations for price recovery in the second half are already included in the guidance. Of course, philosophically, we believe as a company that raw material costs ultimately will be passed along. And therefore, you should think about seeing more to come next year. But the current expectations around pricing are built in our guidance.\nBen Bienvenu: Understood. Okay. Great. My second question is just around the buy versus grow strategy in Chicken. And in particular, you talked about the hatchability issues and that how that should resolve some of your issues over time related to the need to buy breast meat on the outside market. What role does Humboldt play, if any, in that equation? And as it relates to Humboldt, is that on time, on budget? What are the latest qualitative or quantitative commentary points that you could offer us?\nDonnie King: Sure. Great question. Humboldt, let me start with it. Humboldt is a fresh chicken plant. As we look at that business, it\u2019s a growing category for -- predominantly for our retail customers. So, we started in the late April with some FP type products flowing through Humboldt. It will be July -- late July before we actually are harvesting in the animals in the Humboldt. It will be incremental. It will help us from a flexibility of our footprint. There is Humboldt -- or actually across our fresh portfolio help us de-clog and streamline some of our operations. Now the question around buy versus grow, we still support buy versus grow. We still get program, and we will continue to use that. What I've tried to portray is that we move two quarter on the buy instead of growing our own. And we were late, quite honestly, to be able to get the animals down and grow, but we started this year. If you look at the Q1 numbers, we were seeing pretty nice performance in Q1 and then we get into January and hatch really hit us and then the storm in February. And so, we're still processing all of that to understand what it means. But long-term, we will be fine. But buy versus grow is still a good strategy. We're just over dependent upon it right now. If you think about the marketplace, historically, the market would be around $1.10, $1.20, maybe even inching up from there for jumbo boneless skinless breast meat. As of Friday, it was $2.11. So, pretty significant increase in the market. And so, trying to get pricing around that you got to be -- that's a little tricky, but certainly all our models would indicate that growing. It would be the right course in this market environment.\nDean Banks: One other thing just to add to Donnie's answer. It -- just thinking about Humboldt specifically, as a reminder, there is a startup cost for Humboldt, which is about $60 million in the year with most of that in the second half. So, just keep that in mind for your model.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.\nKen Zaslow: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nKen Zaslow: Just two questions. One is on the Beef side, how long do you think that the cattle supply relative to the packing will be in this situation, because I understand that there has been -- the cattle from last year hasn't been fully killed? So, this positive environment, how long does it last? And then, obviously, into 2022, you're still in a good environment. Just want a comment on that, and then I have a follow-up.\nDean Banks: Sure. We're projecting and observing ample cattle supply through the end of the year. And as we're continuing to set-up our plants and increase production, we're going to continue to work through that. But everything looks strong through the end of the year and into 2022. Donnie, do you want to add any color?\nDonnie King: Sure. I will add a little bit to it. There is obviously a higher grain costs in -- on the Beef side and then, of course, the drought conversations which could impact heifer retention, which could portend some longer-term negative implications. But based on everything we see throughout 2020 -- into 2022, at least halfway of what we can say today, there will be ample cattle supply.\nKen Zaslow: Great. And my second question, Donnie, if I look back at 2008, how do you compare and contrast this six on the Chicken operation versus then? And again, if you kind of do that compare and contrast, it seems like there is a real linear path to those type of margins that you once got back in the 2009, 2010 period? And I'll leave it there, and I appreciate it.\nDonnie King: Thanks. Well, there are lot of similarities. The good news, bad news is that we've been down this road before. If I look at some of the differences -- if I go back to 2015, for example, our volume -- our harvest volume in pounds sold is flat to 2015. So, that\u2019s problem one. If you think about in this timeframe, we purchase Keystone, which I think it was like 4.5 million chickens a week from that. So, we\u2019ve essentially rationalized that volume through all of our locations. Our capacity utilization is in the low 80s from harvest perspective. So, if you -- I mean, if you look at the numbers today, if you look at a 20% opportunity on top of that with all the latent capacity, there is a lot of upside from a cost perspective as you look at them. At the same time, our volumes remained flat. And our operational costs have risen, let\u2019s call it, a 5% CAGR. We are on flat volume. And quite honestly, our customers aren't willing to pay for our inefficiencies and we don't expect them to. We've seen pretty significant price increase. If you think from 2015 to 2021, it looks like probably half -- $500 million worth of price decreases because of the market dynamics. And we've had a couple of special event. The SAP cutover in 2019 and then COVID-19 in 2020. So, a long story short there is, we got a higher cost and we get lower volume. And you can put together very simplistically what we have to do to get this business right, to get it to 5% to 7%. And then -- and I'd say 5% to 7%, that's where we're going, but I want to point out that it's 5% to 7% and growing our business, meaning FP business. It could be meat. It would mean harvesting animals to support that business. And so, we think we've got a lot of upside and the future looks a lot brighter than it does today.\nKen Zaslow: Thank you very much. See you all guys.\nDean Banks: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.\nDean Banks: Good morning, Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Good morning. Stewart, the operating income range -- first of all, very helpful. Thank you for including that. Just a question there. It looks like kind of in the front half of the year, your sales price mix was more than double the COGS inflation. And obviously, you're expecting that to reverse pretty materially in the second half of the year. Just -- is there any view to help us understand the magnitude of how much price will recover on the COGS side in the back half, as you think about it on an enterprise-wide level?\nStewart Glendinning: Look, maybe just a couple of things to point out. First of all, you really point out that the mix of the big impact, place to go -- perhaps a little bit more detail is an acute in the segment detail in Note 14, because you're going to be able to take away from that chart that a heavy influence on this number is Beef. And that is why you're going to see the movement looking like you're getting a coverage, which you are in total. But when you break it down at the business level, you're going to see a very different dynamic, obviously, in Prepared Foods, Dean covered that for the back half of the year. Only other thing I'd point out just as a modeling tip is, the cost of grains has gone up substantially. And even since the beginning of this quarter, you will see the grain has shot up. Think back to the data that we gave you during the prepared remarks for grain costs, in the first quarter were sort of $10 million or so higher than last year. In the second quarter, we were $135 million higher than the same quarter last year. That's reflecting that higher cost of grain coming through. Yes, we're hedging. But you need -- those hedges sort of roll. So, the further you get out, at some point you start actually taking that higher cost of grain, and that's what you're seeing as you look through those numbers. So, the second half of the year is going to be bearing grain costs that are a lot higher and our ability to offset that will be dependent on Donnie's set price recovery. But we\u2019ve given you our best estimates in the guidance that we've laid out. There are some areas of fairly significant inflation in the back half.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. No. That\u2019s helpful. And Donnie, maybe just to kind of dot the eye on Chicken. I just wanted to understand if the labor problems that we're now reading about pretty consistently across all industries are really incremental to what you had been experiencing over the past six months to a year, and how you kind of see that labor picture -- particularly in Chicken, and how you see that labor picture, I guess, shaping up? When we would expect it to maybe start to alleviate a little bit, at least, from your perspective?\nDonnie King: Well, if I look at the time horizon over the last year, it's -- I would say it would be improved somewhat to, let\u2019s call it, the height of COVID. We are able to staff plant. We are pretty close to staffing. Just the absenteeism that we are seeing is really unusual for us. And -- but if I look at prior to COVID, we're probably something in order of five, let\u2019s call it, maybe 50% more absenteeism what we experienced prior to that. And so, there is not a magic bullet here. We're looking at all kinds of things, trying to generate worker driven solutions. We talked about wage and we quoted our wage rates that we have today. And -- but we're also looking at different shift model so that our workforce -- they wants us to be able to tell them exactly when they start to work and exactly when they get off, and very few are interested in a six-day-week or a surprised based on customer consumer demand. And of course, we're investing heavily in terms of automation and technology to try to eliminate the more difficult higher turnover jobs. But I would say across Chicken, Beef, Pork, Prepared, in terms of -- it takes about six days right now to get five days\u2019 worth of work done. And so, it's impacting capacity and costs.\nDean Banks: Peter, one other thing I'd mention is, it's just not -- we wouldn\u2019t want to avoid mentioning the impact of stimulus. And that's ultimately going to wind down and should have a positive impact on our ability to recruit. And also further something Donnie said, we have invested heavily into automation. And some of the tougher to staff is -- portions of the facilities, we can take that talent and redeploy to other parts of the facilities. You'll see that coming in the second half of the year.\nPeter Galbo: Thanks very much, guys.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dean Banks for any closing remarks.\nDean Banks: Thanks again everyone for your interest in Tyson Foods. We hope you and your families stay healthy and safe, and we look forward to speaking to you again soon.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Donnie. Turning now to a summary of our total company financial results, we are pleased with year-over-year growth in sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. We performed well despite the challenging operating environment that expend tough labor availability, significant inflationary pressures in raw material costs, global supply chain challenges and evolving demand backdrop. Adjusted operating income was up 43% during the second quarter due to strong performance in our Beef business, along with growth in Prepared Foods earnings, partially offset by softness in Chicken and Pork. For the first half of fiscal 2021, we delivered adjusted operating income growth of 32%. Adjusted EPS grew nearly 70% during the second quarter driven by higher operating income. Fiscal year-to-date adjusted EPS was up 41% on year-to-date basis. Slide 15 bridges our total company sales for the first half. Ongoing retail strength drove much of our sales results. We delivered growth across all our reporting segments in the retail channel. Overall, retail accounted for $700 million in sales improvement during the first half and over $260 million in the second quarter versus comparable periods. Moving to foodservice. Sales declined over $400 million in the first half compared to the same period last year, but improved $69 million in the second quarter. Foodservice recovery was most evident during the second quarter in higher Chicken and Prepared Foods sales versus the same period last year. Our foodservice mix in Chicken indexes to QSRs, which saw volumes above pre-COVID levels during the period. In Prepared Foods, we are seeing recovery in foodservice foot traffic and strong sales into the distribution channel. Exports were up over 5% versus the comparable period, led by Beef where sales improved nearly $100 million for the first half. China is a key driver of Beef export strength. Lastly, we've seen some strength in industrial, particularly in Pork as renewable fuels continue to drive growth in fat and oils demand. In addition, the pace and shape of foodservice recovery will affect the composition of our channel and segment sales in the second half of the fiscal year. Slide 16 shows the bridge for adjusted operating income for the first half. Lower volumes, primarily from production inefficiencies in foodservice were $100 million headwind on gross margin in the first half. Price mix benefited during the first half from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong Beef segment performance, and continued retail strength across segments. Adjusted operating income was burdened by $664 million in cost of goods sold pressure for the period. This amount reflects significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. Of the total, feed ingredients, scrub costs and outside meat purchases associated with the Chicken segment contributed $240 million of pressure. Other large contributors included freight and labor costs. Year-to-date SG&A benefited from the $54 million loss in fiscal 2020 compared to a $55 million gain in fiscal 2021 associated with the cattle supplier fraud and certain reductions in trade spin and travel costs. Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Given continued strength in the Beef segment and our expectations for ongoing foodservice recovery, we are raising our sales guidance for the full year. We now expect to deliver annual revenues in the range of $44 billion to $46 billion. This guidance reflects our expectation of partial price recovery relative to continued feed ingredient and supply chain cost inflation. At the segment level, we expect our directional annual guidance of lower operating margins in Chicken and Pork versus the prior year to hold. Because of stronger than expected performance in Beef and current market conditions, we are raising our guidance on the Beef segment. We now expect segment earnings to be up versus prior year. Finally, we are lowering our guidance in Prepared Foods due to back-off inflationary pressures, and now expect the segments earnings to be flat versus the prior year. Key risks to this guidance include freight rates, labor costs, grain costs in the Chicken segment; raw material costs for our Prepared Foods business and continued export market strength along with price volatility in commodity meets. Our capital expenditures outlook of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion remains unchanged, but we now expect to be at the lower end of the range. Net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $420 million. This update reflects an incremental term loan repayment of $750 million relative to our prior guidance that resulted in the early payoff of our $1.5 billion term loan offset by $500 million of new indebtedness associated with a new bilateral term loan facility. Our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged. We will continue to monitor the potential implications of any new legislation, but do not currently expect to see impacts to our adjusted rate this fiscal year. Our expectations related to liquidity are also unchanged. As we noted last quarter, liquidity decreased from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, ending the second quarter at $2.6 billion. Finally, our COVID-related costs, which totaled $95 million in the quarter, and now expected to be approximately $365 million for the year. Turning to Slide 18. With our strong operational performance through the first half of 2021, we've seen an increase in operating cash flows. We have prioritized deleveraging through the first half, consistent with our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility. Investing organically in our business has been an important priority, which will increase our production capacity and our market capabilities, as well as modernize our operations, while providing strong returns. We will continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through M&A. We have a disciplined approach which focuses on returns and generation of shareholder value. Finally, we're committed to return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In short, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business is both strong and diverse, and we expect our deployment to deliver strong shareholder return. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Dean. Yeah. Ken, Stewart here. Absolutely. It's percentage with some of our rate of return on sales and as you point out that -- that's what you see in the slide. Yeah. Look, the only thing I would add to what Dean has said is that our expectations for price recovery in the second half are already included in the guidance. Of course, philosophically, we believe as a company that raw material costs ultimately will be passed along. And therefore, you should think about seeing more to come next year. But the current expectations around pricing are built in our guidance. Look, maybe just a couple of things to point out. First of all, you really point out that the mix of the big impact, place to go -- perhaps a little bit more detail is an acute in the segment detail in Note 14, because you're going to be able to take away from that chart that a heavy influence on this number is Beef. And that is why you're going to see the movement looking like you're getting a coverage, which you are in total. But when you break it down at the business level, you're going to see a very different dynamic, obviously, in Prepared Foods, Dean covered that for the back half of the year. Only other thing I'd point out just as a modeling tip is, the cost of grains has gone up substantially. And even since the beginning of this quarter, you will see the grain has shot up. Think back to the data that we gave you during the prepared remarks for grain costs, in the first quarter were sort of $10 million or so higher than last year. In the second quarter, we were $135 million higher than the same quarter last year. That's reflecting that higher cost of grain coming through. Yes, we're hedging. But you need -- those hedges sort of roll. So, the further you get out, at some point you start actually taking that higher cost of grain, and that's what you're seeing as you look through those numbers. So, the second half of the year is going to be bearing grain costs that are a lot higher and our ability to offset that will be dependent on Donnie's set price recovery. But we've given you our best estimates in the guidance that we've laid out. There are some areas of fairly significant inflation in the back half."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thanks, Dean. I will start with the Chicken segment performance captured on Slide 8. Sales were $3.6 billion for the second quarter, up 5%. Overall volumes were down in the quarter, primarily due to COVID-related production inefficiencies. Severe winter weather also impacted volumes, operating costs and production efficiencies in the quarter. Average sales price was up substantially during the period due to the favorable mix and the benefit of higher retail volume. Our reported price improvement also reflects actions that we've taken to cover the inflationary pressure we have experienced from higher grain, labor and freight costs. Despite our efforts in the quarter, we did not fully offset the inflationary impacts as a substantial portion of our business is contracted on a fixed annual price basis. The terms negotiated and locked ahead of the recent surge in grain cost. Adjusted operating income was $6 million during the second quarter and $110 million for the fiscal year-to-date, down versus both comparable periods. Fiscal year-to-date operating income was negatively impacted by $145 million of higher feed ingredient costs, as well as $95 million of increased grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases. For the second quarter feed ingredients were $135 million higher. Our grow-out expenses and outside meat purchases were $60 million higher. Segment performance also reflects net derivative gains during the second quarter of $40 million and $110 million for the fiscal year to-date, both versus the respective comparable periods. These gains are associated with realized gains, as well as open positions. Last quarter, we shared our imperatives for improving Chicken operating results, which are captured on Slide 9. Our goal has not changed. We remain committed to restoring top tier performance. The first imperative is related to being the employer of choice. Despite implementing pay rate increases, we continue to deal with elevated absenteeism and turnover. We're implementing a range of initiatives to improve the team member experience and achieve the status of the employer of choice, including flexible work schedules and a competitive wage rate. At this time, we estimate our average base pay plus benefits for domestic productions -- production workers is valued at over $22 per hour. The second imperative relates to our strategy to improve overall operational performance. Although, we have made some progress improving our plant performance, we're not where we plan to be at this stage. Our strategy to improve our operation performance includes restoring our production volume to full capacity. However, we've struggled to raise the harvest to full capacity due to upstream supply issues, including issues caused by lower hatchability rights. Consequently, we have offset raw material shortages with outside meat purchases at a higher level than we have historically, with the recent move in market prices are cost disadvantage from outside purchases has wide. To compensate for cost headwind, we are working to recover our historical advantage on live costs, reduce the number of pounds we're sourcing in the open market and to increase our plant efficiency as we gradually store volume over the balance of the year. The final imperative relates to serving our customers. Our focus is to deliver the highest levels of service to our customers too with respect to order fill rates. When our customers are successful, we are successful. We are sustaining share gains in retail value added as we start to lap the COVID-19 surge and are also leading foodservice recovery and growth. At the same time, our sales team is working to recover raw material and supply chain cost inflation via pricing. To sum all of these imperatives is a restoration of our Chicken business to top tier competitiveness and the coveted position of being our customer's go to supplier. Acknowledging the uncertainty associated with continued COVID-19 recovery, we are increasingly confident in our ability to bring our adjusted operating income margin back to at least 5% to 7% range over time. Moving to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.2 billion for the quarter, up 4% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down 4% in the quarter as growth in the retail channel was offset by reduction in foodservice volumes. Sales growth outpaced volume growth, driven by the partial pass-through of raw material costs, lower commercial spending and better sales mix. Segment operating income was $217 million for the quarter, up 14% versus prior year. For the first half, operating income was $483 million, up 30%. Operating margins for the segment were 10% for the second quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points versus the comparable period. Improvement in operating income was driven by the mixed benefit of strong retail performance, lower commercial spending and pricing pass-throughs, which more than offset higher operating and raw material costs. In the second half, demand is expected to remain elevated at retail, with volumes continuing to exceed pre-COVID levels and foodservice showing sequential improvement. Overall, we're seeing an accelerating inflationary environment that is creating a meaningful headwind for Prepared Foods in the back half of the year. We're seeing raw material cost up over 15%, as well as increases in logistics, packaging, and labor. To offset inflationary pressure, we're focused on pricing, revenue management, commercial spend optimization, while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. Moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 2% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers included a strong domestic and export demand for beef products, with average sales price up 7.5% for the quarter. Sales volume for the quarter was down due to the severe winter weather and production inefficiencies related to the challenging labor environment. Segment operating income was $445 million for the quarter. Operating income improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Operating margins for the segment improved 790 basis points to 11% for the second quarter. Our Beef segment performance has been driven by a favorable supply and demand dynamics, which looked to persist deeper into the year. On beef supply, slightly higher domestic production for the calendar year is being more than offset by lower imports and higher exports, resulting in lower projected domestic availability for the full year. Adequate supply coupled with continued strong domestic and export demand will sustain cutout values and our strong segment results. Now, let's move on to Pork segment on Slide 12. Second quarter results reflect the benefit of strong retail demand and higher exports, which were more than offset by higher hog cost and operating expenses. Segment sales were $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 17% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to stronger demand, partially offset by lower volumes due to production inefficiencies. Average sales price increased by over 17%, while volumes were down slightly relative to the same period last year. Segment adjusted operating income was $67 million for the quarter, down 28% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined by 280 basis points to 4.5% for the quarter. The operating income decline was driven by lower volumes, higher hog costs and increased labor and freight costs. To improve our operating income results for the segment, we have implemented several actions to alleviate production constraints and to improve our volume throughput. As we look ahead, we're closely monitoring hog supply estimates. Recent USDA projections show a historically sharp drop in hog supplies. The sharp decline in supply and strong demand for certain pork items have pushed the cutout up 59% from the end of December. As it stands now, pork cutout is at the highest level for this time of year since 2014. Looking at the overall calendar year, lower projected 2021 pork production and continued robust consumer demand are expected to support hog prices at well above 2020 levels. Slide 13 captures some highlights related to our international business. We continue to invest behind our international platform, which provides an opportunity to grow our sales and our margin by leveraging global production capabilities to feed consumers abroad. We're using our One Tyson framework to identify opportunities to maximize the value of our products and capabilities from farm to table at a global level. Our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships creates the right recipe for growth and positions us with the right to win internationally. I'll now turn the call over to Stewart to provide additional detail on our financial performance. Thanks for the question. Short answer is, yes. We have, obviously, locked in some pricing early, before we saw the run-up in grain. But we've been having non-stop conversations with all of our customers around the inflationary need for pricing. And they have been very responsive. We've had a lot of really good results in -- let's call it mid contract going and having a conversation with those customers. Remember our relationships with our customers, it is a relationship. It is not a transactional event for us and we've invested as they have through the years. And so, they've been very supportive. They certainly understand the inflationary needs and I think we will be quite successful in this endeavor. Sure. Well, let me start with -- as we started the fiscal year, we had one objective and that was to simply be the best chicken company as we move forward. And we obviously recognize that's not where we were and -- or where we are. And so, we began to work on that. And as we get into -- as we got into this, we started seeing good results, particularly in Q1. However, in January, we started -- the recovery slowed down, driven by volume constraints due primarily to chick availability from an unexpected decline in hatch. The winter storm Uri affected our operations broadly, a significant event. We essentially lost a week across our entire poultry enterprise and more broadly across the rest of the businesses as well. As a result of these supply shortages, we compensated with outside meat purchases, which has driven our cost up as market price rallied sharply, particularly after the first quarter. At the same time, costs inflation accelerated with the grain, the highest in the last six years, wage increases and freight costs also impacted us. And as I mentioned earlier, we contracted a large share of our portfolio in the fall and early winter before the prices began to increase materially. We're continuing to deal with turnover and absenteeism. And -- but what I would tell you, despite these headwinds, the fundamentals of our business looking forward are actually quite good. Customer and consumer demand is strong, sustained demand in retail and foodservice recovery with ongoing chicken sandwich promotions. So the outlook and alongside the operational improvements that we're making and the pricing opportunities that we have are quite good. So -- but very specifically, I think about this business and the seven levers that this business or this business model and the levers are price. We simply need to be -- to get paid fair market value. We certainly can't eat all the inflation that we're experiencing now. We've got to get volume back under us. Our business is growing, and we got to get the harvest numbers back up for our business. And we have to continue to get more FP capacity online. We've had a great improvement in mix. We're still struggling with absenteeism. And then, we need to make sure our spend is imbalanced with the volume at which we're processing. And finally, we need to return our live production, spreads -- our historical spread to the industry, we need to regain those spreads. So, what I can tell you is, we know where we are really, and we're not happy with where we are. And we fully understand that we can't talk our way through our poor performance. We do have a great plan in place to be the best chicken company, and we've made great progress. And we'll accelerate that in the back half of the year. I'll tell you, we have a great team in place. Everybody knows what they're doing. And we're not afraid. We're not discouraged. We're a little bit delayed from the -- some of the winter and some of the activities inflation in Q2. But we're very optimistic about this business as we move forward. Thank you. Good morning. I would add -- okay, I would add to that just that China is still at the -- at important deficit. There are new heard losses from ASF, which is slowing their recovery. So, based on the numbers, I saw quoted from Rabobank recently, there'll be flat to about 2020. Good morning. One other point I wanted to make related to the hatch issue is that, it's a bit of a double-edged sword and that not only are we buying a protein in the market to service our further process customers, but in the primary processing, our plant's not running full as some deleveraging. And so, you'll see us in the coming quarters, as we get hatch fixed, we increased capacity in our facilities. We'll absorb some of that deleveraging and get back to operating metrics and operating performance that come alongside that. Sure. Great question. Humboldt, let me start with it. Humboldt is a fresh chicken plant. As we look at that business, it's a growing category for -- predominantly for our retail customers. So, we started in the late April with some FP type products flowing through Humboldt. It will be July -- late July before we actually are harvesting in the animals in the Humboldt. It will be incremental. It will help us from a flexibility of our footprint. There is Humboldt -- or actually across our fresh portfolio help us de-clog and streamline some of our operations. Now the question around buy versus grow, we still support buy versus grow. We still get program, and we will continue to use that. What I've tried to portray is that we move two quarter on the buy instead of growing our own. And we were late, quite honestly, to be able to get the animals down and grow, but we started this year. If you look at the Q1 numbers, we were seeing pretty nice performance in Q1 and then we get into January and hatch really hit us and then the storm in February. And so, we're still processing all of that to understand what it means. But long-term, we will be fine. But buy versus grow is still a good strategy. We're just over dependent upon it right now. If you think about the marketplace, historically, the market would be around $1.10, $1.20, maybe even inching up from there for jumbo boneless skinless breast meat. As of Friday, it was $2.11. So, pretty significant increase in the market. And so, trying to get pricing around that you got to be -- that's a little tricky, but certainly all our models would indicate that growing. It would be the right course in this market environment. Sure. I will add a little bit to it. There is obviously a higher grain costs in -- on the Beef side and then, of course, the drought conversations which could impact heifer retention, which could portend some longer-term negative implications. But based on everything we see throughout 2020 -- into 2022, at least halfway of what we can say today, there will be ample cattle supply. Thanks. Well, there are lot of similarities. The good news, bad news is that we've been down this road before. If I look at some of the differences -- if I go back to 2015, for example, our volume -- our harvest volume in pounds sold is flat to 2015. So, that's problem one. If you think about in this timeframe, we purchase Keystone, which I think it was like 4.5 million chickens a week from that. So, we've essentially rationalized that volume through all of our locations. Our capacity utilization is in the low 80s from harvest perspective. So, if you -- I mean, if you look at the numbers today, if you look at a 20% opportunity on top of that with all the latent capacity, there is a lot of upside from a cost perspective as you look at them. At the same time, our volumes remained flat. And our operational costs have risen, let's call it, a 5% CAGR. We are on flat volume. And quite honestly, our customers aren't willing to pay for our inefficiencies and we don't expect them to. We've seen pretty significant price increase. If you think from 2015 to 2021, it looks like probably half -- $500 million worth of price decreases because of the market dynamics. And we've had a couple of special event. The SAP cutover in 2019 and then COVID-19 in 2020. So, a long story short there is, we got a higher cost and we get lower volume. And you can put together very simplistically what we have to do to get this business right, to get it to 5% to 7%. And then -- and I'd say 5% to 7%, that's where we're going, but I want to point out that it's 5% to 7% and growing our business, meaning FP business. It could be meat. It would mean harvesting animals to support that business. And so, we think we've got a lot of upside and the future looks a lot brighter than it does today. Well, if I look at the time horizon over the last year, it's -- I would say it would be improved somewhat to, let's call it, the height of COVID. We are able to staff plant. We are pretty close to staffing. Just the absenteeism that we are seeing is really unusual for us. And -- but if I look at prior to COVID, we're probably something in order of five, let's call it, maybe 50% more absenteeism what we experienced prior to that. And so, there is not a magic bullet here. We're looking at all kinds of things, trying to generate worker driven solutions. We talked about wage and we quoted our wage rates that we have today. And -- but we're also looking at different shift model so that our workforce -- they wants us to be able to tell them exactly when they start to work and exactly when they get off, and very few are interested in a six-day-week or a surprised based on customer consumer demand. And of course, we're investing heavily in terms of automation and technology to try to eliminate the more difficult higher turnover jobs. But I would say across Chicken, Beef, Pork, Prepared, in terms of -- it takes about six days right now to get five days' worth of work done. And so, it's impacting capacity and costs."

            "content": "Thank you, Megan. Before we get started, I'd like to welcome Donnie King to the earnings call and congratulate him on his recent promotion to Chief Operating Officer. I would also like to thank our 140,000 team members for their continued efforts and resilience. They are what makes this company an incredible place to work, and I'm proud of their focus on raising the world's expectations for how much good food can do. Earlier today, we released our second quarter results for fiscal 2021. We delivered a solid operating earnings performance recording $739 million in adjusted operating income for the quarter, which represents a 43% increase relative to the same period last year. We delivered $1.34 in adjusted earnings per share, a 68% increase from the same period last year. These results were reinforced by our solid performance in retail, our continuing efforts to ensure the safety of our team members, our partnership with customers to enable recovery and our focused execution to overcome inflationary headwinds. Our results in the quarter reflect our continued focus on team member health and safety. This is our top priority, and I'm proud of the progress that we've made on our comprehensive safety, health and wellness agenda, along with our recent vaccine deployment efforts. We also saw improvement in the foodservice channel during the quarter. We've been working closely with our customers to support foodservice recovery. As consumer demand patterns continue to create operational complexities, we've taken action to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and customer needs to accelerate our speed to market. Agility is increasingly important as we look to extend the gains that we have achieved in the retail channel. We continue to drive retail volume growth across our core business lines, delivering growth in the recent quarter is particularly notable as we are now comparing to a prior quarter that included some benefit from initial COVID-19 pantry loading. As we navigate market volatility and rising inflationary pressures, we're focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. Our balance sheet is strong, and we continue to invest in our business. We have prioritized capacity expansion and automation technology investments, and have significantly increased our capital allocated to both of these areas. As an example, our Humboldt production facility in Tennessee has recently commenced operations and our team shipped the first saleable product in late April. To support growth in case-ready beef and pork, we were also excited for the reopening of our Columbia South Carolina plant, as well as the grand opening of our Eagle Mountain, Utah plant, both occurring later this year. We are expanding capacity in our international operations and have six sites where new capacity is currently under construction, positioning our international business for continued growth and profitability in the future. As we look at the balance of the year, we realized that we have a challenging second half ahead as inflationary pressure has continued to build. We also have several price spots, notably our performance in the retail channel and the continued strength in our Beef segment. Looking past the inflationary headwinds that are impacting our input costs, I'm confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value creation. Turning to Slide 4. Team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. Through our partnership with Matrix Medical and our local communities, over 42,000 of our team members have been vaccinated since February. As of today, we've offered onsite vaccination clinics at over 100 locations in more than 30 states. We've also launched a pilot project to enhance health and wellness of our team members. This involves the opening of seven clinics that will enable team members and their families to receive easier access to high-quality healthcare services. Our first facility opened recently in Newbern, Tennessee. Turning now to Slide 5. Our total Tyson and Core Business Lines have posted 11 consecutive quarters of volume and share growth. Notably, our team delivered volume growth in Q2, despite the unusually strong demand associated with pantry loading that occurred during the comparable quarter last year. Sales volume for Tyson Core Business Lines are up 12.7%. In total, Tyson is up 8.5% in the latest 52 weeks. Our share growth has been the strongest in breakfast, sausage, hotdogs, frozen value-added poultry and frozen protein breakfast. Our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our brand and product lines. Total Tyson household penetration reached 81% for the latest 52 weeks. Also consumers continue to rely on low to no contact buying methods. As a result, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 105% in the latest 13 weeks compared with last year. This equated to approximately $425 million of sales through our e-commerce channel partners. Turning to Slide 6. Innovation is important to our success in both retail and foodservice channels, and we continue to invest in the launch and scaling of new product innovations. On this slide, we have three examples of how our product innovation is tied to meaningful consumer insights. In a recent survey, nearly half of Americans expressed dissatisfaction with available plant-based options for the grill. This insight spurred our recent nationwide Raised & Rooted launch, which includes three new products to meet increasing demand for plant-based protein options. We're also excited for our recent launch of alternative protein offerings in the Europe and Asia-Pacific markets, which will support growing global demand for protein. For Jimmy Dean Breakfast Nuggets are another example of our ability to pair brand and category leadership in frozen breakfast with our unique production capabilities to deliver protein dense offerings that complement Tyson's current product portfolio. Finally, annual servings per capita for breaded chicken sandwiches at restaurants are up 14%. And our products in this space have enabled us to capitalize on the growing popularity. Moving to Slide 7. As we continue to navigate complex consumer dynamics overall, we're closely monitoring several factors to effectively engage with our customers and consumers in support of the overall recovery. Protein has remained relevant throughout the pandemic, with 54% of consumers indicating a deliberate intent to increase protein intake within their daily diet and 20% indicating that they are consuming animal protein more often than they were a year ago. In addition to overall protein consumption, we are closely monitoring reopening and recovery patterns. Approximately 76% of the U.S. states are now at 75% or more capacity for in-restaurant dining. With vaccine rollouts and consumer mobility improving, away from home traffic is gradually increasing on a sequential basis. Currently QSR and C-stores are leading the recovery as consumers are very comfortable with ordering takeout. While we are seeing some challenges in our international markets, progress against COVID domestically should continue to improve consumer confidence and mobility in the second half. The U.S. economy is improving rapidly in part due to government stimulus. But we expect some degree of elevated retail consumption to remain post-COVID, our success in growing retail share and driving relevant innovation will allow us to meet the strong demand for protein and serve our customers across all channels. I'll now turn the call over to Donnie to walk us through the segment operating results in detail. Thanks Stewart. To close our prepared remarks, I just want to make a few comments about our priorities for the second half. Looking at the work ahead of us, we are focused on improving operating margins, growing above the market and driving sustainable return for shareholders. To improve our operating margins, we are driving enterprise-wide operational excellence, working aggressively to restore our competitive position in our Chicken segment and structuring our teams to operate at the speed of the market. To grow above the market, our team is focused on working closely with our customers to enable foodservice recovery and support ongoing retail demand. We've also increased investment in value-added capacity expansions in automation technology, which will support increased sales, high efficiency processing, and more agile customer service. Lastly, the strength of our balance sheet will allow us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders consistent with our stated priorities. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Megan. And I just want to add just a compliment to Donnie and the team, we'd committed in previous calls to have visible operating metric improvement at the end of the second quarter. And from everything we've seen early in the quarter and coming out of the previous year, we had seen those operating improvements materializing. It's unfortunate that we're experiencing all the headwinds, but I'm proud of how Donnie and the team is managing those headwinds and the operating improvements they made, which will become visible, as we navigate the headwinds coming forward. Good morning. Sure. Great question. We think some of them are structural in that -- in our program. We changed one of the males that we were using in our business and great brawler performance. But we're not seeing the -- those maternal characteristics, such as egg production and hatch, namely hatch. And so, we've got some of those issues going on. But in terms of the weather, it's a little hard in February, with the Uri, with the impact of that with all the power outages and so forth. We had eggs sitting on a farm without power. So, we saw a loss of embryos as a result of that. So, from February into March, think about this -- those animals that were -- those chicks that were impacted also went through the grow-out cycle and they had issues as they went through there. So, the initial impact was very expensive. But you think about the knock-on effects of that. It's -- those persisted all the way through April and we're just now clearing ourselves to that. But the other side of this, or the view of this is, they are -- in terms of the hatchet is improving. It will improve marginally as we move over, as we elevate -- if you think about our business and our breeder performance, we have a spread from the best to the worst. So just elevating and tightening that spread will give us improvement. Seasonally, we'll get a little bit of improvement. And the knock-on effects from the winter storm will give us a little improvement. So, we're not going to be all the way bright. It'll take us time to work the males that we're changing at. We'll have a new male in place everywhere. Let's call it, Ball and -- but it'll take a full year to see this come back to bright. But we're competent in that. And so that's where we are. Good morning. Thanks. Great question. In terms of the issue, it's -- think of it in terms of a staffing issue impacting capacity. If I think about our Pork business, it's been taking us about six days to do five days' worth of work, because of turnover absenteeism. The other part of that is in terms of the performance is related to not having skilled people in place. And so, we've not been able to get mix optimization in terms of maximizing the cutout, all those variety meats, all those components that are highly attractive from a margin perspective. We're short-staffed right now in our pork plant. We're working on things that you might would expect in terms of work schedules. We're looking at wages in all those cases, and we're also investing in terms of automation and technology to try to alleviate these more difficult and higher turnover jobs. Yeah. So, first off, the case is not just in China, but what we've seen in Germany, it really disrupted global protein flows. Some of the protein was obviously destined for Asia. China, early reports, where they were having some success of repopulating, but our latest research shows that that's really not happening anywhere near the pace that they hope. So, we still see really strong exports going into China to cover that gap. Good morning, Adam. Sure. So, as I think about the -- let's start with the hatch issue. I covered off on a number of those things in terms of it'll be improving sequentially, but we're changing out of male that -- quite frankly, we made a bad decision on and will not be all the way bright until -- let's call it, mid-year of 2022. But we'll sequentially get better between now and then, and hatch. That'll help us supply and supply that we quite frankly need today. We're too dependent on the outside purchases meat right now. And we've -- the market has run up in there. So it's -- the ability to pass on that cost in the marketplace is next to impossible. And so, we need to get our own animals in place. And by the way, that outside purchase is predominantly breast meat and that we have good sales for the back half of the chicken, all the rendered products that come with that, of course, you see the wing bar are well over -- that are over three bucks right now. But in terms of getting to the 5% to 7%, and when I say 5% to 7%, I'm talking about 5% to 7% and business that's growing, growing top line, growing bottom line. And so, we got to staff the plans. I mean, that's an imperative here. And we have to compete with the very best and competing in this example is we need to have a cost structure that is best-in-class. And quite frankly, we haven't had that. And -- but we're well on the road. We have -- much like we did in 2008, we have a path forward. We're looking at those big rocks. Most of them would be in labor yield spin. Volume is certainly a big component of that as well. And we've got to service customers better. Quite honestly, we have not serviced our customers well in almost -- well, two and a half years. I talked about the SAP cutover and then COVID of last year. And so, we got to do that better for our customers. And that certainly helps us. And then that puts us in a position to continue to grow our business. We're being very successful right now with growth in the business. And when we service the customer in full, all the time across all channels, then we get the opportunity to grow our business at even a higher rate. So, all those things are -- all those things that would get you to the 5% to 7% and growing. But it's the fundamentals. It's the fundamentals of the business that we have to get in order. And we're very much aware of those. We're very much aware of where our gaps are to each one of those cost components. And so -- and we've got a good team working on it. So, more to come. Yeah. Sure. Well, look, I mean, I'll tell you. I feel really pretty good about -- our options here. If you think about our capital allocation in three big planks. First, we've been focused on building financial strength and that certainly true as you pointed out our debt to EBITDA ratio is looking good. We do have more debt coming due later this year. And, of course, we have a term loan that's outstanding. So, there's about $1 billion between those two. Then, think about investing in the business. M&A is opportunistic, but, of course, we have and will continue to be pretty disciplined there from a return standpoint. Where you have seen increased capital deployment has been around CapEx, we did earlier this year guide that we would be as high as $1.5 billion. We haven't been able to get some of the projects away as quickly as we've wanted, but you might take away from that early guidance that we have an appetite to invest behind our company in organic kinds of investments. And there are lots of strong opportunities in automation and another profit improvement areas in our business, and notably, lots of opportunity for us to invest in new capacity in our business. And we've got a number of new plants that are coming online. In the prepared remarks we talked about six different sites in our international business, wherever we're investing in new capacity. Donnie spoke about a couple of new plants coming online in the U.S., Humboldt has come online. So, more capital is going against capacity and then as needed for growing business. And then, lastly, of course, 10 years of building growth, we have not been shy to share that cash for shareholders, and we expect to continue to do that in the future. So, I think step back, we've got a well thought out, well balanced approach to capital allocation. Good morning, Ben. Sure. I'll take first shot at this and then pass it over. But we still see tremendous continued retail strength in Prepared Foods and with 11 straight quarters of growth in our core business lines, we're able to command a strong presence there. And as it relates to pricing, we are probably experiencing high input costs from the Pork business. And that will ultimately get passed along. Most of our pricing -- in retail, specifically, we're in a position where we interact with our partner customers quite frequently, and they see what we're experiencing there and we're able to pass that on. We are -- we do expect in the next half to be increasing that spend. It's going to be a requirement obviously to remain competitive in the marketplace. Those investments have paid off in the past, taking against -- as you read and heard 81% household penetration, that's something that we can leverage long-term. In Prepared Foods, the other thing to really keep in mind is that foodservice is coming back. So, we've mentioned that 75% of the areas, which we cover are recovered at about 75%. While we've seen about a 10% dropout in restaurants, those are getting back-filled with those kitchens and a variety of other creative models that -- and ultimately, addition of restaurants to fill that void. We think that that business is going to recover strong. It's a lower margin business. So, we'll see that balancing out, not only due to throughput in the restaurants, but also channel filling, as we get prepared for the full recovery. And last thing I mentioned about foodservice is that please keep in mind, it's obviously regional and it's very different across channels. So, clearly, we've not seen a recovery in K-12 [ph] that we'd expected. And some areas of the world that impact our business, specifically in Europe, they -- they're still buckling under the pressures of COVID. So, foodservice hasn't recovered quite as much as we'd want. So with that, I'll hand it over to Stewart to talk about margin outlook. One other thing just to add to Donnie's answer. It -- just thinking about Humboldt specifically, as a reminder, there is a startup cost for Humboldt, which is about $60 million in the year with most of that in the second half. So, just keep that in mind for your model. Sure. We're projecting and observing ample cattle supply through the end of the year. And as we're continuing to set-up our plants and increase production, we're going to continue to work through that. But everything looks strong through the end of the year and into 2022. Donnie, do you want to add any color? Thanks, Ken. Good morning, Peter. Peter, one other thing I'd mention is, it's just not -- we wouldn't want to avoid mentioning the impact of stimulus. And that's ultimately going to wind down and should have a positive impact on our ability to recruit. And also further something Donnie said, we have invested heavily into automation. And some of the tougher to staff is -- portions of the facilities, we can take that talent and redeploy to other parts of the facilities. You'll see that coming in the second half of the year. Thanks again everyone for your interest in Tyson Foods. We hope you and your families stay healthy and safe, and we look forward to speaking to you again soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Tyson First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Megan Britt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMegan Britt: Hello and welcome to the first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call for Tyson Foods. On the call today are Dean Banks, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stewart Glendinning, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our comments, which are available on the Investor Relations section of the Tyson website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statement regarding our expectations for the future. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties assumptions which may cause actual results to differ materially from our current projections. Please refer to our forward-looking statement disclaimers on slide 2, as well as our SEC filings for additional information concerning risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections. Please note that references to earnings per share, operating income and operating margin and our remarks are on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise noted. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Banks: Thank you, Megan. We are pleased to have you as a new member of our Tyson Foods family and appreciate your leadership. I want to thank everyone listening for your interest in Tyson Foods, and I want to thank our 139,000 dedicated team members, who come to work every day to help keep each other safe and feed the world. Your work is raising the world\u2019s expectations for how much good food can do. Earlier today, we released our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. We delivered strong operating earnings performance, exceeding $1 billion in operating income for the quarter. This performance was driven by higher earnings in our Prepared Foods, Beef and Chicken segments, and demonstrates our effectiveness in addressing customer and consumer needs, while continuing to manage the ongoing effects of the global pandemic. I am exceptionally proud of our global team for their contributions to the strong results. Fundamental to our results are the considerable investments that we\u2019ve made to safeguard the health, safety and wellness of our global team members. This remains our top priority. We also continue to monitor consumer trends. The pandemic spurred changes in consumer demand patterns and created new operational complexities for our team. We have risen to the challenge that these changes have created. We flexed our footprint to adapt to shifting channel demand, scaling retail production up dramatically, and innovating with attractive retail offerings. Our investments in insights, innovation and R&D are helping us win with consumers. As demonstration, we now have delivered 10 consecutive quarters of retail volume growth across our core business lines. As we navigate continued market volatility, we are focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. During the quarter, we realized cost savings and progressively improved our order fulfillment results. We are also on track relative to our stated capital allocation objectives and have prioritized key growth investments to diversify our asset base. Looking forward, I am confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value-creation. Turning to slide 4. Team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. We have an intense focus on team member wellbeing as a fundamental driver of engagement and satisfaction across our enterprise. This quarter, we announced the hiring for the Chief Medical Officer. We welcomed Dr. Claudia Coplein in January and look forward to her additional leadership in ensuring that our organization continues to remain vigilant and aggressive towards overall team member wellness. We have also hired 200 new nurses and administrative staff, bringing the total occupational health staff to almost 600 team members. With these resources, we are advancing our health and safety priorities to support our vaccine rollout and build our wellness program. We\u2019re also opening seven pilot health clinics for team members and their families this year to increase their access to health care in the communities where we operate. I\u2019m exceptionally pleased to report that our advanced preparations and investments have allowed us to start COVID-19 vaccinations on a limited basis as vaccines have become available. We\u2019ve extended our ongoing partnership with Matrix Medical, a leading clinical services provider to prepare for broad vaccine distribution and to ensure the U.S. team members are educated across multiple languages about the COVID-19 vaccine. This is part of our ongoing effort to ensure our team members have information and access to the best protections available. In addition to supporting vaccine deployment, we continue to use testing as a major component of our COVID-19 monitoring strategy, and part of our health and safety measures to protect team members. We are testing thousands of team members every week and currently estimate that we have tested more than half our workforce. Our always-on testing strategy is another proactive step in our efforts to search for and fight the virus. The result of our proactive approach has been a dramatic reduction in COVID-19 occurrence within our plants with strong accomplishment, given the surge in cases nationally. As we look forward to the prospect of recovery in the months ahead, we have an incredible opportunity through our leading position in sustainability and social responsibility to drive a more sustainable future for our Company and our planet. We are excited for the upcoming publication of our annual sustainability report later this spring, which will show continued progress across our three key focus areas, including empowering people, conserving natural resources and cultivating innovation in agriculture. As I consider our impact in these important objectives, I\u2019m very proud of how our teams continue to drive progress and their tireless efforts towards lasting change. Since February of 2020, Tyson has donated nearly 90 million meals to aid hunger relief efforts in our communities, and we will continue to support those local communities where help is needed. We will also improve our environmental footprint as we feed the world. In fact, we were the first across our peer group to announce greenhouse gas reduction targets that were accepted by the science-based targets initiative, a bold commitment to achieving a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We are also committed to leading in the advancement of animal welfare outcomes with transparency. To this end, we recently partnered with the University of Arkansas, Division of Agriculture to fund research and animal welfare, and commercial broiler farms, which will guide industry efforts to continuously improve welfare for the birds entrusted to our care. These initiatives and many more to come, solidify Tyson\u2019s position as a leader within this space, and our consistent progress is being recognized. We ranked number one in the Food Production category on the 2021 Fortune magazine, World\u2019s Most Admired Companies list. This is our fifth consecutive year in a row to receive that recognition. Turning now to slide 6. While we\u2019ve experienced an operating environment that has seen pockets of volatility over the past few quarters, we are starting to see consumer behavior stabilize within the retail and food service channels. Our diverse protein portfolio continues to be well-positioned to support current consumption patterns. Consistent with our experience last year, continued strength in at-home consumption is delivering historically high retail and e-commerce sales. We continue to outperform peers with stronger retail volume growth. Our total Tyson and core business lines have posted 10 consecutive quarters of growth and four straight quarters of double-digit expansion, continuing to outpace total food and beverage. Volumes in core business lines were up nearly 14% during the latest 13 weeks and 19% during the latest 52 weeks. Our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our brands and product lines. Total Tyson household penetration reached 81%, and we continue to see an increased number of shopping trips that included a Tyson product, up 11% versus a year ago. As consumers increased their reliance on low to no contact buying methods during the quarter, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 89% in the latest 13 weeks, compared to last year. This equated to approximately $330 million of sales through our e-commerce channel partners. We expect e-commerce channels to remain very relevant moving forward, as consumers maintain and shift to convenient low to no contact buying methods. Foodservice volumes were still down relative to pre-COVID-19 levels, but our channel and category mix sets us up well for recovery as nationwide vaccination efforts are expected to drive more away-from-home protein consumption occasions. It\u2019s important to note that some foodservice operators have adapted very well to the current environment and have embraced drive-through and takeout. Many of these operators are not seeing the volume declines others have, and some are even outpacing historical pre-COVID-19 performance. Winning those consumers by meeting their needs is core to our strategy, and new innovations are a big part of that. Turning to slide 7, we\u2019re excited to share some new product launches that are showing signs of early success. Our Air Fried Chicken line has been in market for just over a year, and it\u2019s already showing great momentum with very-strong repeat purchase rates. We\u2019re proud of how our innovation capabilities help us meet consumers\u2019 health and wellness needs and have driven new buyers to the category. Approximately 11% of volumes from the Air Fried line\u2019s initial launch period are generated by new consumers. Jimmy Dean, one of our iconic billion dollar brands, recently extended into the breakfast burrito category, a natural progression for an industry leading product line rooted in convenience and tasty offerings across breakfast occasions. We\u2019re seeing strong incremental Jimmy Dean volumes from this product offering as well as solid repeat purchase rates. Just last month, we launched new alternative protein offerings under the Jimmy Dean label, including the Plant-Based Patty Croissant, which is already exceeding our original demand forecast. Recognized and trusted brands like Jimmy Dean provide a powerful platform to offer plant-based options, which is an illustration of our One Tyson strategy in action. Each of these exciting product launches reaffirms Tyson\u2019s ability to bring innovative and on trend products to market as part of our overall growth strategy. This innovation engine creates synergies across not only the retail channel, but also foodservice. Turning to slide 8. We\u2019re also making progress on several other key strategic areas that will create long-term shareholder value. First, the core part of Tyson\u2019s strategy is operational excellence. We strive to produce high-quality products with efficient operations and top notch customer service. We are working aggressively to realize improvement opportunities, especially in our Chicken segment. Later in the call, Stewart will share additional detail on our actions to improve operating results in the Chicken segment. In general, through our ongoing financial fitness, we are pursuing significant cost savings opportunities across our business. Next, we are making the organic investments necessary to meet growing global protein demand. Our international platform increasingly provides an opportunity to grow overall sales and margins by leveraging our global production capabilities to reach an international customer base. We\u2019re using our One Tyson framework to identify synergy opportunities and to maximize the value from farm to table at the global level. Because of our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships, we believe we have the right recipe for growth and the right to win in these attractive international markets. Overall, we estimate that approximately 60% of our capital expenditures are going toward growth objectives. An area of increased investment is value-added capacity expansion and automation technology, which will support increased sales, high-efficiency processing and better customer service, among others. In addition, we\u2019re using technology to improve employee health and safety, animal wellbeing and environmental management. Lastly, our capital allocation priorities build financial strength, allowing us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. We have disciplined processes to ensure that investments we make optimize our returns and drive long-term shareholder value. We\u2019re also committed to return capital to shareholders. Our business performance has allowed us to increase our dividend per share each year for the last nine years. I\u2019d like to move now to a review of our first quarter fiscal 2021 performance for the total Company, which is captured on slide 9. We delivered sales of $10.5 billion in the quarter, slightly down versus the same period last year. Volumes were lower, primarily due to reduced foodservice volumes, partially offset by higher retail volumes. Note also that the $320 million charge related to our poultry litigation accrual was recorded as a reduction to sales in the quarter. We delivered operating income of over $1 billion during the quarter, up 24% versus the same period a year ago. The company experienced strong operating income performance in Beef and Prepared Foods, while the Pork segment softened and the Chicken business showed signs of improvement. Total Company operating income margin was 9.5%. This strong performance resulted in $1.94 in earnings per share for the quarter, an increase of approximately 28% versus the same period last year. In line with our focus on team member health and safety, we incurred $120 million of direct incremental COVID-19 costs during the first quarter. These costs have not been adjusted out of our results and include items such as PPE, testing, medical partnerships, product downgrades, donations as well as enhanced employee pay and benefits. Overall, our business performed well during the quarter, while showing profitability and operational improvements on a year-over-year basis in key areas. Our retail business has seen continued and strong performance as a result of our depth of brand and product offerings. Based on our growing share positions and increasing presence within consumer shopping carts, we believe we\u2019re well positioned for continued strength at retail. We\u2019re also partnering with our foodservice customers to ensure they are prepared to meet increasing channel demand as the COVID-19 vaccination rollout continues and consumers gradually become more active away from home. Finally, our team and business has performed, but we certainly still have growth and execution opportunities ahead that we are actively pursuing. I will now turn the call over to Stewart. He will share our detailed financial performance before I return to provide closing remarks.\nStewart Glendinning: Thanks, Dean, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Prepared Foods, sales were $2.1 billion for the quarter, roughly flat versus the same period last year, reflecting higher retail and lower foodservice sales. Total volume was down 9%. Segment operating income was $266 million for the quarter, up 48% versus prior year. This substantial improvement in profitability was driven by strong retail performance, lower commercial spending, as a result of continued strength in retail demand, and lapping of issues experienced as a result of our ERP rollout last year. Offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to commodity price increases and other input cost inflation, along with COVID-related costs and impacts on our manufacturing efficiency. As demand gradually normalizes post-COVID, we expect higher levels of commercial spending in order to meet our category growth objectives and negative mix impacts from higher foodservice volumes. As this shift occurs, we expect some benefits from improving fixed cost deleverage as volumes increase back to historical levels. Operating margins for the segment were 12.6% for the first quarter, an improvement of more than 400 basis points versus the comparable period. We\u2019re also happy to see our business operations stabilizing in key areas, which has allowed us to improve our service levels, as well as fill rates with our customers. Moving on to our Chicken segment. First quarter results show an improved operating income relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were $2.8 billion for the quarter, down 14% versus prior year, in large part because of a $320 million reduction in sales from the poultry litigation accrual. Volumes were down 7% relative to the same period last year, primarily due to lost foodservice sales but were offset by bright spots in our retail value-added categories, as well as strong sales to certain national account QSR chains. Sales and volumes continue to be impacted by both, channel shifts and intermittent operational issues resulting from the pandemic, including higher absenteeism at our production facilities. Segment operating income was $104 million for the quarter, up 33% versus the same quarter last year. The operating income improvement was driven by price increases on certain products and cost-saving initiatives as we continue working to improve the competitiveness of our Chicken operations. We also saw a positive impact from derivatives of approximately $70 million in the quarter. Operating margins for the segment improved 90 basis points to 3.3% for the first quarter. We are driving actions in three areas within our Chicken business in order to restore top tier performance, being the employer of choice, improving operational performance and our relentless focus on serving our customers\u2019 needs. Higher levels of absenteeism and turnover have created inefficiency in our operations as they leave us short of team members to fully stop our plants and also drive higher levels of overtime pay. As a result, we\u2019re implementing a range of measures designed to enhance the attractiveness of our production-related roles, including increased pay, and the use of automation and technology to supplement some of the more difficult and high turnover jobs. Next, our process flow in the plant has not been optimal, and we\u2019ve been working steadily to correct this. Clearly, the disruptions caused by COVID have not helped, but we\u2019re starting to see improvement and expect that to continue during the year. This will be the source of considerable savings over time. Lastly, COVID channel shifts and volatile demand have negatively impacted our order fulfillment rates. Changes we\u2019ve made to plant operations in response to COVID are yielding improvements, and we expect that further improvements will result as we reduce our staffing gaps and drive operational flow improvements. This is, of course, in addition to the benefits expected as foodservice begins to recover. Moving to the Beef segment. First quarter results show an improvement relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 4% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers include strong domestic and export demand for beef products with volumes up 5.6% for the quarter. Segment operating income was $528 million for the quarter, up 45% versus prior year. Operating income improvement was driven by higher volumes as we lapped the prior year impacts of our Finney County plant fire. We also realized a $55 million gain related to recoveries from the cattle supplier fraud, offset by higher COVID-related operating costs. These higher costs were mostly driven by bonuses paid to our frontline team members. Note also that the comparable period last year was revised down by $68 million, associated with the cattle supplier of fraud, affecting the year-over-year comparison. Operating margins for the segment improved 370 basis points to 13.2% for the first quarter. Now, let\u2019s move on to the Pork segment on slide 14. First quarter results show a softening relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were $1.4 billion for the quarter, up about 4% versus the comparable period last year. These sales drivers for the segment included lower volumes as a result of temporary idling of one of our production facilities, offset by stronger demand. Volumes were down 3% for the quarter relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $116 million for the quarter, down 40% versus the comparable period. Operating income degradation was driven by production inefficiencies, the temporary idling of the previously mentioned production facility and COVID-related operating costs. We also experienced higher live animal costs, which was not fully offset by price. Operating margins for the segment declined by 590 basis points to 8.1% for the first quarter. Moving to slide 15. I\u2019ll share the quarterly results impact on certain cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion, up nearly $500 million versus the prior year. Liquidity strengthened to $4.2 billion as of January 2, 2021. Gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.6 times was down slightly compared to prior year-end. And on a net debt basis, we were at 2 times, aided by the strong cash flows in this quarter. Net interest expense totaled $108 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%. Capital expenditures came in at $289 million. We paid $159 million of dividends during the quarter and purchased $17 million of shares related to our employee stock plans. Turning now to a discussion on our financial outlook. Clearly, an important headline this quarter is the sharp rise in grain costs. Grain futures for 2021 have continued to strengthen due to diminished stocks to use expectations for corn and soybeans, and strong export demand, particularly from China. We expect hedging and pricing actions will allow our team to mitigate some grain cost impacts moving ahead. But, at this time, it is difficult to estimate just how much can be mitigated through those actions. As a reminder, a $0.10 per bushel move in corn price or a $10 per ton move in soybean meal translates into an approximate change of $25 million in cost of goods sold. We\u2019ve also seen some recent inflationary pressure in our freight costs, largely due to a shortage of drivers. In our international and export businesses, these freight dynamics are manifesting themselves through increased container costs. Our team\u2019s efforts to mitigate future freight and transportation risks will continue to ensure our products are shipped efficiently and effectively to meet customer needs. Lastly, looking at our assumptions related to the adequacy of live animal inventory, live cattle inventories remain ample to support our beef business, and we believe hog inventories will remain adequate, despite a small decrease in supply. Having said that, both cattle and hog futures have moved higher since October, and we\u2019re working to minimize the impact to our business, particularly in the Prepared Foods segment where retail prices do not move as dynamically. Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect to deliver annual revenues at the top end of our previous range of $42 billion to $44 billion, supported by our strong first quarter performance. We also expect our directional annual guidance versus last year of improved operating margins in Prepared Foods and lower operating margins in Pork to hold. At current grain prices, operating margins in Chicken will likely be lower than prior year. Because of stronger-than-expected performance in Beef and current market conditions, we expect Beef to deliver an operating margin similar to last year\u2019s 10.1% or marginally lower. Key risks to this guidance include rate rates as well as labor availability and costs across all segments, grain costs in the Chicken segment, raw material costs for our Prepared Foods business and continued export market strength. We are revising our capital expenditures outlook to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as we continue to build capacity across our network. As we noted last quarter, the majority of this spend will be toward capacity expansions in chicken, case-ready beef and pork, prepared foods and international. Net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $430 million, which reflects a recent term loan repayment of $750 million that occurred during our second quarter. Our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged, but we will continue to monitor the potential implications of legislation from the new administration. Our expectations related to liquidity are unchanged, although we expect our liquidity to decrease from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, based on the term loan repayment as well as our seasonally higher cash usage during our second quarter. Finally, we have continued to invest in health and safety, and wellbeing of our team members. And our COVID-related costs, which totaled $120 million in the quarter, are now expected to be approximately $440 million for the year. It remains to be seen what portion of these costs will be permanent. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Dean.\nDean Banks: Thanks, Stewart. In summary, our multi-protein portfolio delivered strong first quarter results that will create the fuel for disciplined investments and higher margin, higher growth opportunities ahead, and we will seek opportunities to remove unnecessary costs and invest in the right areas. Our retail performance is showing tremendous strength, and our operational flexibility positions us well for a gradual recovery in foodservice volumes. We remain focused on fostering a culture of health, safety and wellness, and protecting our team members through workplace protections and a leading COVID-19 monitoring program, as well as our vaccine preparations. I\u2019m energized by our team\u2019s commitment to delivering healthy, safe and accessible protein to global consumers, their ability to continuously innovate and their ongoing emphasis on operational execution. We\u2019re optimistic about the continued success of Tyson Foods as our diverse portfolio has us well positioned for long-term sustainable growth. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Megan.\nMegan Britt: Thanks, Dean. We\u2019ll now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both, our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.\nBen Bienvenu: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019ve got two questions. One about guidance, and then, the second kind of bigger picture strategic question. First on guidance. I want to focus in on the Chicken guidance, given that -- I think most of the other elements of your guidance make sense, but I wanted to probe on Chicken. I understand the view around rising grain costs. And I know relatively low stocks to use, that\u2019s going to be a particularly tight environment this year. Let me juxtapose that though with what chicken prices have done year-to-date. I\u2019m curious around what\u2019s embedded in your outlook as it relates to chicken prices for the year relative to grain costs? And then, also relative to last year, which was tumultuous for the industry and for you, you\u2019ve had some unusual charges and costs last year that, in some ways, artificially suppressed your chicken margins. So, maybe talk about that relative to your view and your guidance this morning that Chicken margins will be lower year-over-year.\nDean Banks: Sure, Ben. First off, thanks for the question. Thanks for the interest in the Company. As you saw in the slide presentation, we are making substantial investments towards improving the Chicken business overall. First off in being the employer of choice, we\u2019re making investments in operational performance and really getting our fill rates up to ultimately service our customers. Those are not bullets on a slide. Those are actions that are actively taking place. And as we said before, we\u2019re one of the world\u2019s largest chicken businesses. So, it\u2019s going to take some time for those activities to materialize into our operational performance overall. As it relates to pricing, as we\u2019ve said before, a lot of the pricing in the Company happens if the poultry happens in the first and second quarter. We\u2019ve made substantial progress there and are satisfied with how it\u2019s coming together.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. So, when we -- just as a quick follow-up on that. When we look at kind of commodity chicken market, I guess, we need to assume a more tempered impact of the dynamics in that market on your chicken sales prices to square up with your guidance in your release this morning. Is that a fair characterization?\nDean Banks: The industry as a whole is certainly facing a number of headwinds with grains, with transportation costs, labor, et cetera. We\u2019re managing those. Some of that\u2019s uncontrollable. We will see -- with vaccinations, we will see foodservice recovery, but its effect on price, I\u2019m not going to project.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Fair enough. My second question is kind of bigger picture, on the renewable diesel industry and the projected growth in that industry that\u2019s growing rapidly. It\u2019s having even already a pretty meaningful impact on rendered animal fats and rendered animal fats pricing. I know you guys are a large render in the chicken operations. I\u2019m curious, one, how you think you\u2019re positioned relative to that bigger picture structural demand driver? And two, if you can comment on how actively you are involved in being a feedstock provider to any producers?\nDean Banks: Sure, a few things there. Rendering is a fantastic part of our business and gives us certainly some improved margins that we can make full use of whatever animals are entrusted into our care. It also gives us a lot of flexibility in production. So, the purchase of API that we made a few years ago has turned out to be great for the business. You may also know that we\u2019ve made an investment in a joint venture with Jacob Stern in our Beef and Pork business to take a lot of the byproduct and make that ready and more ready for renewable diesel. That\u2019s a great partnership and progressing well. We do see strong demand for all of the animal byproducts that could be going into that space, and we think it\u2019s a promising part of the business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess, just continuing on the Chicken business, and I\u2019m just trying to make sure I\u2019m thinking about the moving pieces here properly. Is the outlook, the revised outlook for profit to be down year-on-year, is that solely a function of grain? Is there some of the absorption of the incremental COVID costs? Has your underlying productivity kind of expectations changed in a material way, kind of thoughts on mix? I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand how the view has evolved since you gave the outlook in November and maybe find your plan in some of those buckets?\nDean Banks: Like I said in the previous answer, we are investing heavily in getting that business back on track. And we do expect foodservice recovery to help with some of the historical deleveraging we\u2019ve seen there as we convert business from back to foodservice. Stewart, do you want to add anything?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. That would be great. Look, in the presentation, we shared with you some specifics on where we\u2019re working in Chicken. We wanted you to be clear that we understand where the challenges are and where we are making changes. With respect to the change in forecast, you\u2019re right. I mean, the biggest change is grains. I mean, the change in pricing in grains has been nothing less than enormous. And that is going to weigh on the business. So, that\u2019s a simple -- the easiest answer.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That\u2019s all very helpful. And then, as we think about maybe beyond this year, I\u2019m just -- with the grain environment is what it is, those things will work themselves out one way or the other, either pricing in the industry will move higher over time, or [indiscernible] actually will get back into surplus at one day [ph]. Help me think, has the view on kind of through-cycle profitability in the Chicken business changed, or how do you think about kind of where the opportunity really is? I mean, the business has had been in a lot of different places from a profitability perspective in the last five, seven years. And I think we\u2019re all kind of struggling to calibrate a little bit where the portfolio is currently structured can really get to in a normal market environment, when it\u2019s executing properly?\nDean Banks: Yes. I think, we described before that we do expect the operational improvements that we\u2019re making to materialize in the second half of the year and really, really show up in 2022. Again, with being one of the largest poultry businesses in the world, it takes some time to get those operational improvements back on track. We put Donnie King in place have a very strong team there that are really on top of the things that we know that we need to improve to be where we want to be. The long-term supply demand dynamics in the classic poultry cycles, I\u2019m not necessarily going to comment on. But, I will say that our ability to value up our portfolio into our retail businesses and to add features and attributes that bring new households into our brands and into our poultry business, like you\u2019ve seen with Air Fried are nothing short of exceptional. I think, that gives us a real advantage in the future to expand upon -- to make the business not only competitive, but winning in the space.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Maybe to pivot a little bit to Prepared Foods. The slide, I think it\u2019s 15 in the deck is helpful in understanding kind of some of the input costs and understanding that maybe as foodservice comes back, there\u2019s a little bit of a negative mix. But, I wanted to shift the conversation to pricing ability there within Prepared Foods maybe on the retail side, as you\u2019re seeing these levels of inflation. Is there anything you\u2019ve done or anything you\u2019ve seen in your internal research that would say, consumer elasticities are different this time around, whether it\u2019s due to higher savings rates or people being stuck at home, even in a post-COVID world that do you feel like your ability to pass along pricing in Prepared Foods this time might be easier, just given some of the dynamics of the consumer that have changed? And then, I have a follow-up as well.\nDean Banks: I would say that we do see higher consumer interest in spending on food. I think, that\u2019s benefited a couple of our businesses. Prepared Foods is one, Beef is another, just very, very strong demand. And again, our flexibility from retail to foodservice is going to allow us to step in and meet consumers wherever they are. Some of the costs that we incur, we can happily pass along to customers, some we can\u2019t, and we do see rising input costs there. But, we\u2019re very, very well positioned with the portfolio to meet consumers where they are and make sure that we\u2019re able to take care of them.\nPeter Galbo: Okay. And maybe just one on Chicken and maybe to ask Adam\u2019s question in a bit of a different way. Looking at the three kind of pillars you guys have outlined for improving Chicken, I mean, those are all helpful from our perspective. But, I guess, what\u2019s tough is it\u2019s hard for us to view this from an outside perspective and understand if things are actually going right underlying. So, is there any way for us to track how these improvements are going from an external basis or anywhere you would want to steer for us to know that you\u2019re on the right track?\nDean Banks: I\u2019d say that what you can do is take a look at our historical financial performance, see where we\u2019re going. A lot of the market indicators related to our retail product performance is indicative of us being able to gain customer traction there. And then, you can probably look back at the historical foodservice performance with some rough estimates and see that when we pick up foodservice, when that volume comes back, and we can pick our volume back up that the operational improvements that we put in place are going to help us deleverage -- or fix the deleverage and operate at a higher level.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Good morning. And Megan, welcome. I wanted to ask about the Beef guidance improvement. I know, it\u2019s not officially quantitative, but the tone is better. And I just wanted to ask how much of that is from underlying fundamentals getting a little bit better versus the change in comp period results and the gain from your cattle supplier issue. I just wanted a sense of what the underlying, I guess, dynamics are there?\nDean Banks: Generally, the dynamics are very good for the business, and the team is managing those dynamics extremely well. There\u2019s very strong demand in really all channels, including exports. And from a supply perspective, it\u2019s really clear that we\u2019ve seen a slight downtick of about 1% in breeder stock, but the cattle supply remains strong for the business. And as we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s a spread business. So, the operational component, the teams are nailing and the dynamics for the industry are actually looking attractive.\nKen Goldman: Thanks. And then, my follow-up is, a little more than 10 years ago, grain prices were even more volatile than they are now, at the time chicken industry reacted in part by changing some of its pricing dynamics. So, I think some agreements went from once a year to maybe adjusting a few times a year. I know you have dozens of pricing mechanisms and agreements, it\u2019s probably understanding it. But in general, do you have the desire, the ability to amend some of your contracts, so when you get a little bit closer to cost-plus across the board in chicken or something effectively like that? I guess, the reason I\u2019m asking is, I think the stocks multiple sometimes is held back by unpredictability. And the more that you not have to worry about grain because there\u2019s an adjustment mechanism for your chicken prices, the but better. Just curious about your thoughts along those lines.\nDean Banks: Yes. There\u2019s a variety of mechanisms that we use in managing input costs. We\u2019ve talked about the hedging and forward strategy, where when we sign agreements, we do try to lock in the price for those agreements to fix the margin. As it relates to market pricing, as we\u2019ve described before, there is a lot of different mechanisms, some cost-plus some market based, et cetera. I can\u2019t really give any input on how we would consider changing pricing mechanisms, for obvious reasons.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.\nKen Zaslow: My first question is, you said that 60% of your capital spending is going to growth. In an environment where you\u2019re a little struggling with your operational efficiencies, particularly in Chicken, why not dedicate more resources to that to ensure the margin structure gets to where you want to be on an operational basis rather than focus on growth. Just a philosophical question, I guess.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Ken, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily conflate those two things. I think, first of all, on the chicken side, all resources that are necessary to help bring that business back are being deployed there. So, absolutely no shortage of investment there. But, when you look across the portfolio, there are a number of places where we have opportunity to grow our business by adding capacity. You think about our case-ready plant that is opening in Utah, we\u2019ve got a number of opportunities in Prepared Foods. And we recognize that unless we put money ahead to meet that capacity, we\u2019re going to be in a place where we miss out on sales.\nKen Zaslow: Okay. And then, my follow-up question is, what is your ability to realize the higher pricing in chicken? It sounds like -- I understand the feed cost side, even the operational side, but it sounds like we\u2019re seeing breast prices move. We\u2019re seeing leg prices move. Wing prices are pretty substantially higher. And yet, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re fully incorporated. Is it just because of the contracts have to kind of get through, and we\u2019ll start to see that by the end of the year or into next year? How are you about that? Just the realization of pricing seems a little bit more delayed than I would have thought.\nDean Banks: We are obviously gaining from the market prices. We do have some buy versus growth strategy where we do buy some breast meat in the market, et cetera. I can\u2019t really comment on pricing looking forward. So, I can\u2019t comment.\nStewart Glendinning: Ken, the only thing I\u2019d say is that, to Dean\u2019s earlier comments, we have a wide range of pricing mechanisms. Some of those are, as we\u2019ve shared in the past, fixed over a longer period of time. Clearly, those are not going to move as quickly. Others are spot, and we\u2019ll respond quickly as the market rises. I wouldn\u2019t discount, obviously, the fact that -- my earlier point, which is that the move in grains is pretty substantial. And I wouldn\u2019t overlook either the increase in transportation costs that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. So, it\u2019s -- there is a number of factors there that are going to play out in the P&L.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Hey. Good morning, Dean and Stewart. And thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on surprisingly strong quarter. Quick -- two quick ones. So, first of all, within the broader concept of Chicken and obviously your investments in new plants. So, just to understand and if you could maybe reiterate what you said about three months ago. So, clearly, there\u2019s still going to be the start-up cost to consider, right? And that\u2019s part of your guidance, just to be clear, what you said three months ago to have this properly reflected in the model. Is that correct?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. That\u2019s correct. I will just give you a little bit of update on that. I did say at the time that I thought that the start-up in Humboldt was going to cost about $100 million. That\u2019s coming in a little less expensively now, and we think it\u2019s going to run about $75 million in the year.\nBen Theurer: Okay, perfect. That\u2019s a good update. And then, just following up a little bit on the Beef segment and what you came to obviously there. And I mean, it really looks like it\u2019s going to a very profitable year. But, how do you think about the Beef business more in the medium term? I mean, clearly, it\u2019s been on a profitable basis and on a strong run rate over the last couple of years now. Last year was by far, exceptional, you expect another very, very strong year in \u201821 with the updated guidance. But, where do you think this is going to turn out more like a normalized run rate? How do you think cattle suppliers are going to work through? And where do you think there might be a little bit of a headwind, if grain prices were to stay high, to reflect also maybe higher cattle prices, and how can you prepare for that?\nDean Banks: So, we do see that cattle -- while greater stock is a slight downtick and could decline over time, herd supplies are actually still very, very strong into the foreseeable future. And what is also quite good for the business is that demand is very strong. And so, we feel like the business is positioned good for the long term. We\u2019re not setting long-term margin guidance for the business, but we feel like the dynamics do look positive into the foreseeable future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: So, coming back to the Prepared Foods business, the margin obviously improved very nicely this time around. You mentioned that you pulled back on marketing spending. I\u2019m just wondering, is that from -- assuming that that comes back, and I\u2019d like to hear what your plans are for marketing spending going forward. Is that -- is this kind of the margin run rate that we might expect on that business, or is there still lumpiness that could play out there?\nDean Banks: A few things that I would just emphasize. You are correct that we will continue to reinvest in marketing and advertising as needed. There\u2019s been such strong demand and outstripping production in many ways. And so, we\u2019ve pulled that cost back for the time being. It will ultimately return, we won\u2019t be getting projections necessarily on how much that will return to. The other thing to keep in mind is just from a mix perspective, we\u2019ve been thrilled having consumers go to retail outlets in order to get our food. We will see foodservice recover. And from a mix perspective, that will come in probably at a slightly lower margin. And therefore, we do know that Prepared Foods will have some normalization as foodservice ultimately recovers with vaccination rollouts, et cetera.\nAlexia Howard: Okay, great. And then, as a follow-up, on the Pork side of the business, can we talk about the strength of the export markets at the moment? You\u2019ve talked about that in recent quarters, particularly given the African swine fever dynamic. As we see the swine herd in China, kind of get back to not quite normal levels, but moving in that direction, do you think that whole dynamic of African swine fever pushing up global pork prices is -- what innings are we in, I guess, is the question? Are we more than halfway through that at this point? I imagine we are.\nDean Banks: It\u2019s hard to project, to be honest. We still hear reports of ASF in China. We also do know that they\u2019re making aggressive measures to build a commercial herd there and making some progress towards that. We\u2019ve seen global redistribution of protein related to ASF cases in Germany and Vietnam and others. That continues to play itself out generally positively. We see very strong demand for pork, which is helping offset some of the increase in hog prices. And so far, the business is performing well. Projecting ASF is very difficult. We\u2019ve seen historically it to take decade plus to recover from ASF in certain markets. And so, we hesitate to call whether or not we\u2019re halfway through that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Piken: I just wanted to get a flavor on the Pork side of the business. Are you doing anything in terms of trying to prepare for California\u2019s Prop 12, which is supposed to take effect next year?\nDean Banks: So, we\u2019re obviously aware of the legislation. We are looking at the impacts on the business, but otherwise can\u2019t comment.\nMichael Piken: Okay. And then, I guess, just kind of shifting gears over back to the Beef side a little bit. I know you mentioned that you think there\u2019s going to be adequate availability of cattle. What are your expectations in terms of, as we progress through the year, in terms of kind of the cattle weights, the grading? And does that have any impact on your mix if weights come off between the choice-select, or is it relatively -- are you guys relatively indifferent, if there\u2019s any changes in the way it\u2019s kind of moving forward?\nDean Banks: Whether it\u2019s weather or grains, we will always be looking for the most -- the high-value and the most valuable cattle in the market. It\u2019s not really -- at this point, not really the time we can project out impacts from that, although our team has done a phenomenal job at buying in the marketplace and making sure that we get the right cuts, and we can put those out in the highest margin, highest value. We have invested substantially in our portion of business. We have capacity coming on line in a couple of places in this year next. And I think that\u2019s going to actually continue to support both, Beef and Pork and those businesses as we continue to add value and really meet the customers where they want to buy and with the portions and pieces that they want.\nOperator: And just to reiterate, is there time for one last question today?\nDean Banks: One last question.\nOperator: Thank you. That question will be from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: I wanted to touch on the international piece of the business, and I guess, maybe understand how much, if any of the gross CapEx is there, is directed there? And where you see the biggest opportunities internationally, either from an organic growth perspective or potentially interest in M&A?\nDean Banks: As we\u2019ve said before, the international markets are where we see the majority of protein demand growth coming from going forward. We\u2019re really proud of our teams embracing the One Tyson concept and looking at how we can use our global footprint to take whether it\u2019s a variety of meats in the U.S. and export those and have those valued up into the global marketplace. The acquisitions that we\u2019ve made internationally are really helping us both in further processing product that\u2019s exported from the U.S., but also in really taking advantage of synergies related to different skill sets, functions, innovation that we\u2019ve established globally. So, the international business is a continued focus for ours. We\u2019ll continue to invest capital from an organic perspective, and we are always looking for acquisitions. You\u2019ve seen the recent announcements that we are partnering with Malayan Flour Mills. There\u2019ll be more deals like that and others to come.\nStewart Glendinning: Only other thing I\u2019ll just add on top too, specific on the CapEx, Michael, is we have announced investments in plants in both Asia as well as in Europe. So, yes, specific money is going there to build out new capacity to meet the demand that we see.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the Jimmy Dean Plant-Based Patty. Could you just touch on some of your thinking using the Jimmy Dean brand with plant-based and what the consumer insights were behind that, and how you think about that launch?\nDean Banks: Sure. That brand has just tremendous value to the customer. And if you\u2019ve been to a retail grocery store and look at the freezer, the breadth and depth of that portfolio resonates with just a variety of customers. Plant-based protein, not only do we have a phenomenal substrate or innovation there, but we think that that brings another customer to that freezer aisle and complements our business. And so, it was a very thoughtful approach, and you\u2019ll see more of that to come.\nMichael Lavery: And so, I think, you just alluded to this at the very end, but there\u2019ll be -- we should look for more plant-based options to come as well?\nDean Banks: Yes. Our investments in plant-based protein are continuing to show velocities and results that we would expect. So, we\u2019ll continue to be investing in that area.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dean Banks for any closing remarks.\nDean Banks: Thanks again everyone for your interest in Tyson Foods. We hope you and your families stay healthy and safe. And we look forward to speaking to you all again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Dean, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Prepared Foods, sales were $2.1 billion for the quarter, roughly flat versus the same period last year, reflecting higher retail and lower foodservice sales. Total volume was down 9%. Segment operating income was $266 million for the quarter, up 48% versus prior year. This substantial improvement in profitability was driven by strong retail performance, lower commercial spending, as a result of continued strength in retail demand, and lapping of issues experienced as a result of our ERP rollout last year. Offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to commodity price increases and other input cost inflation, along with COVID-related costs and impacts on our manufacturing efficiency. As demand gradually normalizes post-COVID, we expect higher levels of commercial spending in order to meet our category growth objectives and negative mix impacts from higher foodservice volumes. As this shift occurs, we expect some benefits from improving fixed cost deleverage as volumes increase back to historical levels. Operating margins for the segment were 12.6% for the first quarter, an improvement of more than 400 basis points versus the comparable period. We're also happy to see our business operations stabilizing in key areas, which has allowed us to improve our service levels, as well as fill rates with our customers. Moving on to our Chicken segment. First quarter results show an improved operating income relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were $2.8 billion for the quarter, down 14% versus prior year, in large part because of a $320 million reduction in sales from the poultry litigation accrual. Volumes were down 7% relative to the same period last year, primarily due to lost foodservice sales but were offset by bright spots in our retail value-added categories, as well as strong sales to certain national account QSR chains. Sales and volumes continue to be impacted by both, channel shifts and intermittent operational issues resulting from the pandemic, including higher absenteeism at our production facilities. Segment operating income was $104 million for the quarter, up 33% versus the same quarter last year. The operating income improvement was driven by price increases on certain products and cost-saving initiatives as we continue working to improve the competitiveness of our Chicken operations. We also saw a positive impact from derivatives of approximately $70 million in the quarter. Operating margins for the segment improved 90 basis points to 3.3% for the first quarter. We are driving actions in three areas within our Chicken business in order to restore top tier performance, being the employer of choice, improving operational performance and our relentless focus on serving our customers' needs. Higher levels of absenteeism and turnover have created inefficiency in our operations as they leave us short of team members to fully stop our plants and also drive higher levels of overtime pay. As a result, we're implementing a range of measures designed to enhance the attractiveness of our production-related roles, including increased pay, and the use of automation and technology to supplement some of the more difficult and high turnover jobs. Next, our process flow in the plant has not been optimal, and we've been working steadily to correct this. Clearly, the disruptions caused by COVID have not helped, but we're starting to see improvement and expect that to continue during the year. This will be the source of considerable savings over time. Lastly, COVID channel shifts and volatile demand have negatively impacted our order fulfillment rates. Changes we've made to plant operations in response to COVID are yielding improvements, and we expect that further improvements will result as we reduce our staffing gaps and drive operational flow improvements. This is, of course, in addition to the benefits expected as foodservice begins to recover. Moving to the Beef segment. First quarter results show an improvement relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were approximately $4 billion for the quarter, up 4% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers include strong domestic and export demand for beef products with volumes up 5.6% for the quarter. Segment operating income was $528 million for the quarter, up 45% versus prior year. Operating income improvement was driven by higher volumes as we lapped the prior year impacts of our Finney County plant fire. We also realized a $55 million gain related to recoveries from the cattle supplier fraud, offset by higher COVID-related operating costs. These higher costs were mostly driven by bonuses paid to our frontline team members. Note also that the comparable period last year was revised down by $68 million, associated with the cattle supplier of fraud, affecting the year-over-year comparison. Operating margins for the segment improved 370 basis points to 13.2% for the first quarter. Now, let's move on to the Pork segment on slide 14. First quarter results show a softening relative to the same period last year. Segment sales were $1.4 billion for the quarter, up about 4% versus the comparable period last year. These sales drivers for the segment included lower volumes as a result of temporary idling of one of our production facilities, offset by stronger demand. Volumes were down 3% for the quarter relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $116 million for the quarter, down 40% versus the comparable period. Operating income degradation was driven by production inefficiencies, the temporary idling of the previously mentioned production facility and COVID-related operating costs. We also experienced higher live animal costs, which was not fully offset by price. Operating margins for the segment declined by 590 basis points to 8.1% for the first quarter. Moving to slide 15. I'll share the quarterly results impact on certain cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion, up nearly $500 million versus the prior year. Liquidity strengthened to $4.2 billion as of January 2, 2021. Gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.6 times was down slightly compared to prior year-end. And on a net debt basis, we were at 2 times, aided by the strong cash flows in this quarter. Net interest expense totaled $108 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5%. Capital expenditures came in at $289 million. We paid $159 million of dividends during the quarter and purchased $17 million of shares related to our employee stock plans. Turning now to a discussion on our financial outlook. Clearly, an important headline this quarter is the sharp rise in grain costs. Grain futures for 2021 have continued to strengthen due to diminished stocks to use expectations for corn and soybeans, and strong export demand, particularly from China. We expect hedging and pricing actions will allow our team to mitigate some grain cost impacts moving ahead. But, at this time, it is difficult to estimate just how much can be mitigated through those actions. As a reminder, a $0.10 per bushel move in corn price or a $10 per ton move in soybean meal translates into an approximate change of $25 million in cost of goods sold. We've also seen some recent inflationary pressure in our freight costs, largely due to a shortage of drivers. In our international and export businesses, these freight dynamics are manifesting themselves through increased container costs. Our team's efforts to mitigate future freight and transportation risks will continue to ensure our products are shipped efficiently and effectively to meet customer needs. Lastly, looking at our assumptions related to the adequacy of live animal inventory, live cattle inventories remain ample to support our beef business, and we believe hog inventories will remain adequate, despite a small decrease in supply. Having said that, both cattle and hog futures have moved higher since October, and we're working to minimize the impact to our business, particularly in the Prepared Foods segment where retail prices do not move as dynamically. Slide 17 captures our financial outlook for fiscal 2021. We expect to deliver annual revenues at the top end of our previous range of $42 billion to $44 billion, supported by our strong first quarter performance. We also expect our directional annual guidance versus last year of improved operating margins in Prepared Foods and lower operating margins in Pork to hold. At current grain prices, operating margins in Chicken will likely be lower than prior year. Because of stronger-than-expected performance in Beef and current market conditions, we expect Beef to deliver an operating margin similar to last year's 10.1% or marginally lower. Key risks to this guidance include rate rates as well as labor availability and costs across all segments, grain costs in the Chicken segment, raw material costs for our Prepared Foods business and continued export market strength. We are revising our capital expenditures outlook to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as we continue to build capacity across our network. As we noted last quarter, the majority of this spend will be toward capacity expansions in chicken, case-ready beef and pork, prepared foods and international. Net interest expense is expected to be lower than our previous outlook at approximately $430 million, which reflects a recent term loan repayment of $750 million that occurred during our second quarter. Our outlook on effective tax rate is unchanged, but we will continue to monitor the potential implications of legislation from the new administration. Our expectations related to liquidity are unchanged, although we expect our liquidity to decrease from $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, based on the term loan repayment as well as our seasonally higher cash usage during our second quarter. Finally, we have continued to invest in health and safety, and wellbeing of our team members. And our COVID-related costs, which totaled $120 million in the quarter, are now expected to be approximately $440 million for the year. It remains to be seen what portion of these costs will be permanent. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Dean. Yes. That would be great. Look, in the presentation, we shared with you some specifics on where we're working in Chicken. We wanted you to be clear that we understand where the challenges are and where we are making changes. With respect to the change in forecast, you're right. I mean, the biggest change is grains. I mean, the change in pricing in grains has been nothing less than enormous. And that is going to weigh on the business. So, that's a simple -- the easiest answer. Yes. Ken, I wouldn't necessarily conflate those two things. I think, first of all, on the chicken side, all resources that are necessary to help bring that business back are being deployed there. So, absolutely no shortage of investment there. But, when you look across the portfolio, there are a number of places where we have opportunity to grow our business by adding capacity. You think about our case-ready plant that is opening in Utah, we've got a number of opportunities in Prepared Foods. And we recognize that unless we put money ahead to meet that capacity, we're going to be in a place where we miss out on sales. Ken, the only thing I'd say is that, to Dean's earlier comments, we have a wide range of pricing mechanisms. Some of those are, as we've shared in the past, fixed over a longer period of time. Clearly, those are not going to move as quickly. Others are spot, and we'll respond quickly as the market rises. I wouldn't discount, obviously, the fact that -- my earlier point, which is that the move in grains is pretty substantial. And I wouldn't overlook either the increase in transportation costs that we're seeing in the marketplace. So, it's -- there is a number of factors there that are going to play out in the P&L. Yes. That's correct. I will just give you a little bit of update on that. I did say at the time that I thought that the start-up in Humboldt was going to cost about $100 million. That's coming in a little less expensively now, and we think it's going to run about $75 million in the year. Only other thing I'll just add on top too, specific on the CapEx, Michael, is we have announced investments in plants in both Asia as well as in Europe. So, yes, specific money is going there to build out new capacity to meet the demand that we see."

            "name": "Dean Banks",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan. We are pleased to have you as a new member of our Tyson Foods family and appreciate your leadership. I want to thank everyone listening for your interest in Tyson Foods, and I want to thank our 139,000 dedicated team members, who come to work every day to help keep each other safe and feed the world. Your work is raising the world's expectations for how much good food can do. Earlier today, we released our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. We delivered strong operating earnings performance, exceeding $1 billion in operating income for the quarter. This performance was driven by higher earnings in our Prepared Foods, Beef and Chicken segments, and demonstrates our effectiveness in addressing customer and consumer needs, while continuing to manage the ongoing effects of the global pandemic. I am exceptionally proud of our global team for their contributions to the strong results. Fundamental to our results are the considerable investments that we've made to safeguard the health, safety and wellness of our global team members. This remains our top priority. We also continue to monitor consumer trends. The pandemic spurred changes in consumer demand patterns and created new operational complexities for our team. We have risen to the challenge that these changes have created. We flexed our footprint to adapt to shifting channel demand, scaling retail production up dramatically, and innovating with attractive retail offerings. Our investments in insights, innovation and R&D are helping us win with consumers. As demonstration, we now have delivered 10 consecutive quarters of retail volume growth across our core business lines. As we navigate continued market volatility, we are focused on operational excellence and disciplined cost management. During the quarter, we realized cost savings and progressively improved our order fulfillment results. We are also on track relative to our stated capital allocation objectives and have prioritized key growth investments to diversify our asset base. Looking forward, I am confident that our team is executing on the right priorities to meet our commitments and drive shareholder value-creation. Turning to slide 4. Team member health and safety is and will continue to be our top priority. We have an intense focus on team member wellbeing as a fundamental driver of engagement and satisfaction across our enterprise. This quarter, we announced the hiring for the Chief Medical Officer. We welcomed Dr. Claudia Coplein in January and look forward to her additional leadership in ensuring that our organization continues to remain vigilant and aggressive towards overall team member wellness. We have also hired 200 new nurses and administrative staff, bringing the total occupational health staff to almost 600 team members. With these resources, we are advancing our health and safety priorities to support our vaccine rollout and build our wellness program. We're also opening seven pilot health clinics for team members and their families this year to increase their access to health care in the communities where we operate. I'm exceptionally pleased to report that our advanced preparations and investments have allowed us to start COVID-19 vaccinations on a limited basis as vaccines have become available. We've extended our ongoing partnership with Matrix Medical, a leading clinical services provider to prepare for broad vaccine distribution and to ensure the U.S. team members are educated across multiple languages about the COVID-19 vaccine. This is part of our ongoing effort to ensure our team members have information and access to the best protections available. In addition to supporting vaccine deployment, we continue to use testing as a major component of our COVID-19 monitoring strategy, and part of our health and safety measures to protect team members. We are testing thousands of team members every week and currently estimate that we have tested more than half our workforce. Our always-on testing strategy is another proactive step in our efforts to search for and fight the virus. The result of our proactive approach has been a dramatic reduction in COVID-19 occurrence within our plants with strong accomplishment, given the surge in cases nationally. As we look forward to the prospect of recovery in the months ahead, we have an incredible opportunity through our leading position in sustainability and social responsibility to drive a more sustainable future for our Company and our planet. We are excited for the upcoming publication of our annual sustainability report later this spring, which will show continued progress across our three key focus areas, including empowering people, conserving natural resources and cultivating innovation in agriculture. As I consider our impact in these important objectives, I'm very proud of how our teams continue to drive progress and their tireless efforts towards lasting change. Since February of 2020, Tyson has donated nearly 90 million meals to aid hunger relief efforts in our communities, and we will continue to support those local communities where help is needed. We will also improve our environmental footprint as we feed the world. In fact, we were the first across our peer group to announce greenhouse gas reduction targets that were accepted by the science-based targets initiative, a bold commitment to achieving a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We are also committed to leading in the advancement of animal welfare outcomes with transparency. To this end, we recently partnered with the University of Arkansas, Division of Agriculture to fund research and animal welfare, and commercial broiler farms, which will guide industry efforts to continuously improve welfare for the birds entrusted to our care. These initiatives and many more to come, solidify Tyson's position as a leader within this space, and our consistent progress is being recognized. We ranked number one in the Food Production category on the 2021 Fortune magazine, World's Most Admired Companies list. This is our fifth consecutive year in a row to receive that recognition. Turning now to slide 6. While we've experienced an operating environment that has seen pockets of volatility over the past few quarters, we are starting to see consumer behavior stabilize within the retail and food service channels. Our diverse protein portfolio continues to be well-positioned to support current consumption patterns. Consistent with our experience last year, continued strength in at-home consumption is delivering historically high retail and e-commerce sales. We continue to outperform peers with stronger retail volume growth. Our total Tyson and core business lines have posted 10 consecutive quarters of growth and four straight quarters of double-digit expansion, continuing to outpace total food and beverage. Volumes in core business lines were up nearly 14% during the latest 13 weeks and 19% during the latest 52 weeks. Our growth during these periods was driven in large part by our ability to bring incremental households into our brands and product lines. Total Tyson household penetration reached 81%, and we continue to see an increased number of shopping trips that included a Tyson product, up 11% versus a year ago. As consumers increased their reliance on low to no contact buying methods during the quarter, we experienced e-commerce sales growth of 89% in the latest 13 weeks, compared to last year. This equated to approximately $330 million of sales through our e-commerce channel partners. We expect e-commerce channels to remain very relevant moving forward, as consumers maintain and shift to convenient low to no contact buying methods. Foodservice volumes were still down relative to pre-COVID-19 levels, but our channel and category mix sets us up well for recovery as nationwide vaccination efforts are expected to drive more away-from-home protein consumption occasions. It's important to note that some foodservice operators have adapted very well to the current environment and have embraced drive-through and takeout. Many of these operators are not seeing the volume declines others have, and some are even outpacing historical pre-COVID-19 performance. Winning those consumers by meeting their needs is core to our strategy, and new innovations are a big part of that. Turning to slide 7, we're excited to share some new product launches that are showing signs of early success. Our Air Fried Chicken line has been in market for just over a year, and it's already showing great momentum with very-strong repeat purchase rates. We're proud of how our innovation capabilities help us meet consumers' health and wellness needs and have driven new buyers to the category. Approximately 11% of volumes from the Air Fried line's initial launch period are generated by new consumers. Jimmy Dean, one of our iconic billion dollar brands, recently extended into the breakfast burrito category, a natural progression for an industry leading product line rooted in convenience and tasty offerings across breakfast occasions. We're seeing strong incremental Jimmy Dean volumes from this product offering as well as solid repeat purchase rates. Just last month, we launched new alternative protein offerings under the Jimmy Dean label, including the Plant-Based Patty Croissant, which is already exceeding our original demand forecast. Recognized and trusted brands like Jimmy Dean provide a powerful platform to offer plant-based options, which is an illustration of our One Tyson strategy in action. Each of these exciting product launches reaffirms Tyson's ability to bring innovative and on trend products to market as part of our overall growth strategy. This innovation engine creates synergies across not only the retail channel, but also foodservice. Turning to slide 8. We're also making progress on several other key strategic areas that will create long-term shareholder value. First, the core part of Tyson's strategy is operational excellence. We strive to produce high-quality products with efficient operations and top notch customer service. We are working aggressively to realize improvement opportunities, especially in our Chicken segment. Later in the call, Stewart will share additional detail on our actions to improve operating results in the Chicken segment. In general, through our ongoing financial fitness, we are pursuing significant cost savings opportunities across our business. Next, we are making the organic investments necessary to meet growing global protein demand. Our international platform increasingly provides an opportunity to grow overall sales and margins by leveraging our global production capabilities to reach an international customer base. We're using our One Tyson framework to identify synergy opportunities and to maximize the value from farm to table at the global level. Because of our existing depth of experience in protein production, brand management and global customer relationships, we believe we have the right recipe for growth and the right to win in these attractive international markets. Overall, we estimate that approximately 60% of our capital expenditures are going toward growth objectives. An area of increased investment is value-added capacity expansion and automation technology, which will support increased sales, high-efficiency processing and better customer service, among others. In addition, we're using technology to improve employee health and safety, animal wellbeing and environmental management. Lastly, our capital allocation priorities build financial strength, allowing us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. We have disciplined processes to ensure that investments we make optimize our returns and drive long-term shareholder value. We're also committed to return capital to shareholders. Our business performance has allowed us to increase our dividend per share each year for the last nine years. I'd like to move now to a review of our first quarter fiscal 2021 performance for the total Company, which is captured on slide 9. We delivered sales of $10.5 billion in the quarter, slightly down versus the same period last year. Volumes were lower, primarily due to reduced foodservice volumes, partially offset by higher retail volumes. Note also that the $320 million charge related to our poultry litigation accrual was recorded as a reduction to sales in the quarter. We delivered operating income of over $1 billion during the quarter, up 24% versus the same period a year ago. The company experienced strong operating income performance in Beef and Prepared Foods, while the Pork segment softened and the Chicken business showed signs of improvement. Total Company operating income margin was 9.5%. This strong performance resulted in $1.94 in earnings per share for the quarter, an increase of approximately 28% versus the same period last year. In line with our focus on team member health and safety, we incurred $120 million of direct incremental COVID-19 costs during the first quarter. These costs have not been adjusted out of our results and include items such as PPE, testing, medical partnerships, product downgrades, donations as well as enhanced employee pay and benefits. Overall, our business performed well during the quarter, while showing profitability and operational improvements on a year-over-year basis in key areas. Our retail business has seen continued and strong performance as a result of our depth of brand and product offerings. Based on our growing share positions and increasing presence within consumer shopping carts, we believe we're well positioned for continued strength at retail. We're also partnering with our foodservice customers to ensure they are prepared to meet increasing channel demand as the COVID-19 vaccination rollout continues and consumers gradually become more active away from home. Finally, our team and business has performed, but we certainly still have growth and execution opportunities ahead that we are actively pursuing. I will now turn the call over to Stewart. He will share our detailed financial performance before I return to provide closing remarks. Thanks, Stewart. In summary, our multi-protein portfolio delivered strong first quarter results that will create the fuel for disciplined investments and higher margin, higher growth opportunities ahead, and we will seek opportunities to remove unnecessary costs and invest in the right areas. Our retail performance is showing tremendous strength, and our operational flexibility positions us well for a gradual recovery in foodservice volumes. We remain focused on fostering a culture of health, safety and wellness, and protecting our team members through workplace protections and a leading COVID-19 monitoring program, as well as our vaccine preparations. I'm energized by our team's commitment to delivering healthy, safe and accessible protein to global consumers, their ability to continuously innovate and their ongoing emphasis on operational execution. We're optimistic about the continued success of Tyson Foods as our diverse portfolio has us well positioned for long-term sustainable growth. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Megan. Sure, Ben. First off, thanks for the question. Thanks for the interest in the Company. As you saw in the slide presentation, we are making substantial investments towards improving the Chicken business overall. First off in being the employer of choice, we're making investments in operational performance and really getting our fill rates up to ultimately service our customers. Those are not bullets on a slide. Those are actions that are actively taking place. And as we said before, we're one of the world's largest chicken businesses. So, it's going to take some time for those activities to materialize into our operational performance overall. As it relates to pricing, as we've said before, a lot of the pricing in the Company happens if the poultry happens in the first and second quarter. We've made substantial progress there and are satisfied with how it's coming together. The industry as a whole is certainly facing a number of headwinds with grains, with transportation costs, labor, et cetera. We're managing those. Some of that's uncontrollable. We will see -- with vaccinations, we will see foodservice recovery, but its effect on price, I'm not going to project. Sure, a few things there. Rendering is a fantastic part of our business and gives us certainly some improved margins that we can make full use of whatever animals are entrusted into our care. It also gives us a lot of flexibility in production. So, the purchase of API that we made a few years ago has turned out to be great for the business. You may also know that we've made an investment in a joint venture with Jacob Stern in our Beef and Pork business to take a lot of the byproduct and make that ready and more ready for renewable diesel. That's a great partnership and progressing well. We do see strong demand for all of the animal byproducts that could be going into that space, and we think it's a promising part of the business. Like I said in the previous answer, we are investing heavily in getting that business back on track. And we do expect foodservice recovery to help with some of the historical deleveraging we've seen there as we convert business from back to foodservice. Stewart, do you want to add anything? Yes. I think, we described before that we do expect the operational improvements that we're making to materialize in the second half of the year and really, really show up in 2022. Again, with being one of the largest poultry businesses in the world, it takes some time to get those operational improvements back on track. We put Donnie King in place have a very strong team there that are really on top of the things that we know that we need to improve to be where we want to be. The long-term supply demand dynamics in the classic poultry cycles, I'm not necessarily going to comment on. But, I will say that our ability to value up our portfolio into our retail businesses and to add features and attributes that bring new households into our brands and into our poultry business, like you've seen with Air Fried are nothing short of exceptional. I think, that gives us a real advantage in the future to expand upon -- to make the business not only competitive, but winning in the space. I would say that we do see higher consumer interest in spending on food. I think, that's benefited a couple of our businesses. Prepared Foods is one, Beef is another, just very, very strong demand. And again, our flexibility from retail to foodservice is going to allow us to step in and meet consumers wherever they are. Some of the costs that we incur, we can happily pass along to customers, some we can't, and we do see rising input costs there. But, we're very, very well positioned with the portfolio to meet consumers where they are and make sure that we're able to take care of them. I'd say that what you can do is take a look at our historical financial performance, see where we're going. A lot of the market indicators related to our retail product performance is indicative of us being able to gain customer traction there. And then, you can probably look back at the historical foodservice performance with some rough estimates and see that when we pick up foodservice, when that volume comes back, and we can pick our volume back up that the operational improvements that we put in place are going to help us deleverage -- or fix the deleverage and operate at a higher level. Generally, the dynamics are very good for the business, and the team is managing those dynamics extremely well. There's very strong demand in really all channels, including exports. And from a supply perspective, it's really clear that we've seen a slight downtick of about 1% in breeder stock, but the cattle supply remains strong for the business. And as we've said before, it's a spread business. So, the operational component, the teams are nailing and the dynamics for the industry are actually looking attractive. Yes. There's a variety of mechanisms that we use in managing input costs. We've talked about the hedging and forward strategy, where when we sign agreements, we do try to lock in the price for those agreements to fix the margin. As it relates to market pricing, as we've described before, there is a lot of different mechanisms, some cost-plus some market based, et cetera. I can't really give any input on how we would consider changing pricing mechanisms, for obvious reasons. We are obviously gaining from the market prices. We do have some buy versus growth strategy where we do buy some breast meat in the market, et cetera. I can't really comment on pricing looking forward. So, I can't comment. So, we do see that cattle -- while greater stock is a slight downtick and could decline over time, herd supplies are actually still very, very strong into the foreseeable future. And what is also quite good for the business is that demand is very strong. And so, we feel like the business is positioned good for the long term. We're not setting long-term margin guidance for the business, but we feel like the dynamics do look positive into the foreseeable future. A few things that I would just emphasize. You are correct that we will continue to reinvest in marketing and advertising as needed. There's been such strong demand and outstripping production in many ways. And so, we've pulled that cost back for the time being. It will ultimately return, we won't be getting projections necessarily on how much that will return to. The other thing to keep in mind is just from a mix perspective, we've been thrilled having consumers go to retail outlets in order to get our food. We will see foodservice recover. And from a mix perspective, that will come in probably at a slightly lower margin. And therefore, we do know that Prepared Foods will have some normalization as foodservice ultimately recovers with vaccination rollouts, et cetera. It's hard to project, to be honest. We still hear reports of ASF in China. We also do know that they're making aggressive measures to build a commercial herd there and making some progress towards that. We've seen global redistribution of protein related to ASF cases in Germany and Vietnam and others. That continues to play itself out generally positively. We see very strong demand for pork, which is helping offset some of the increase in hog prices. And so far, the business is performing well. Projecting ASF is very difficult. We've seen historically it to take decade plus to recover from ASF in certain markets. And so, we hesitate to call whether or not we're halfway through that. So, we're obviously aware of the legislation. We are looking at the impacts on the business, but otherwise can't comment. Whether it's weather or grains, we will always be looking for the most -- the high-value and the most valuable cattle in the market. It's not really -- at this point, not really the time we can project out impacts from that, although our team has done a phenomenal job at buying in the marketplace and making sure that we get the right cuts, and we can put those out in the highest margin, highest value. We have invested substantially in our portion of business. We have capacity coming on line in a couple of places in this year next. And I think that's going to actually continue to support both, Beef and Pork and those businesses as we continue to add value and really meet the customers where they want to buy and with the portions and pieces that they want. One last question. As we've said before, the international markets are where we see the majority of protein demand growth coming from going forward. We're really proud of our teams embracing the One Tyson concept and looking at how we can use our global footprint to take whether it's a variety of meats in the U.S. and export those and have those valued up into the global marketplace. The acquisitions that we've made internationally are really helping us both in further processing product that's exported from the U.S., but also in really taking advantage of synergies related to different skill sets, functions, innovation that we've established globally. So, the international business is a continued focus for ours. We'll continue to invest capital from an organic perspective, and we are always looking for acquisitions. You've seen the recent announcements that we are partnering with Malayan Flour Mills. There'll be more deals like that and others to come. Sure. That brand has just tremendous value to the customer. And if you've been to a retail grocery store and look at the freezer, the breadth and depth of that portfolio resonates with just a variety of customers. Plant-based protein, not only do we have a phenomenal substrate or innovation there, but we think that that brings another customer to that freezer aisle and complements our business. And so, it was a very thoughtful approach, and you'll see more of that to come. Yes. Our investments in plant-based protein are continuing to show velocities and results that we would expect. So, we'll continue to be investing in that area. Thanks again everyone for your interest in Tyson Foods. We hope you and your families stay healthy and safe. And we look forward to speaking to you all again soon. Thank you."

I will now turn the call over to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thank you, Brandon, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we announced our fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2022 results. We showed record annual financial performance, including revenue, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team members. Our results would not have been possible without them. In this challenging macroeconomic environment with historically high inflation, consumer demand for protein remains relatively steady. We remain well positioned to serve this demand. We leveraged our diverse protein portfolio across multiple channels and brands to meet customer and consumer needs across a broad range of products and price points, serving an estimated one-fifth of U.S. protein consumption. And as proven by our double-digit sales growth, our portfolio of value-added and branded products positions us uniquely to win. In addition to growing sales, we are also aggressively mitigating inflationary cost and SG&A expenses through a disciplined revenue management and enterprise-wide productivity actions, including investments in automation to improve operational excellence and efficiency. As we progress our efforts to be the most sought after place to work, we continue to listen to our team members' needs and invest in areas like childcare to provide a better quality of life for our team members. We're beginning to see results from these investments through improved staffing levels and reduced turnover. Before I discuss our financial performance, let me provide a bit of strategic context. As you are well aware, we have a strong and disciplined strategic growth plan. In this past year, we continue to methodically execute against this plan as we strengthened our position as a global protein leader. Our growth strategy is built on five key pillars: transforming our team member experience; growing with our customers to service demand; investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence; restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment; and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. I'm pleased to report that we have executed on each of these imperatives and delivered what we said we would, entering the fiscal year. Our commitment to strengthening our position as a global protein leader and driving value creation for our shareholders is the most important goal for our team. Having the right leadership team in place is also imperative as a global protein leader. To accomplish this, we recently announced changes in our executive leadership team, which we believe will drive improved results across our organization. Overall, we feel good about our performance. We saw a lot of really good things. We delivered record sales, revenue and earnings. The Chicken turnaround progressed as promised. Beef performed better than expected. And Prepared Foods is seeing positive volume momentum exiting the year. With that strategic context, let's turn to our financial performance. Compared to our initial fiscal year guidance, we exceeded our total company sales and Beef margin guidance. And we met guidance on Chicken and Prepared Foods margins. We managed our balance sheet and sit today at a leverage ratio comfortably below our guidance. Sales improved 7% for the fourth quarter and 13% year-over-year. We delivered record sales revenue as a company and across each of our four largest operating segments. We delivered record annual adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion, up 3% over the prior year. As expected, our fourth quarter earnings were lower compared to the prior year, but this was almost entirely due to record strength in Beef a year ago. Our operating income performance translated to adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 for the fourth quarter and a record $8.73 for the full year, up 5% from last year. Turning to our results on volume. We're continuing to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. We saw benefits of our efforts in the fourth quarter as total company volume increased 2.1%. We are building positive momentum and remain confident that our strategy will enable us to grow volumes across all segments long term. Chicken volumes increased 1.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year, driven by increased domestic production. In Prepared Foods, volumes were relatively flat in the quarter compared to the prior year. We are gaining momentum delivering sequential quarterly improvement, driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. The categories in which we play continue to be highly consumer-relevant with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre pandemic. In a few slides, we'll discuss our strong share performance. Compared to prior year, Beef volumes were up 5.1% for the quarter, driven by higher head throughput and carcass weight, improving from a full year volume deficit of 1.5% in the third quarter. We finished the year relatively flat. Pork volumes were down 1.1% for the quarter compared to prior year due to limited hog supply and reduced export demand. In International, volumes continue to grow, up 7.3% compared to the prior year quarter driven by our investments in capacity, innovation and brands that support market share growth. As we look ahead, one thing that excites me is the momentum I see in our branded retail business. It is evident that we are delivering the brands and the products that consumers want. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in growth up 18% in volume sales in the last 13 weeks compared to pre-pandemic levels per Nielsen data. According to Nielsen data, Tyson core business lines grew volume share by 2.6 points this quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels, while also growing share relative to a year ago. We continue to be the market share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete while also gaining share in 7 of these 9 core categories. We experienced the greatest share gains in frozen protein breakfast, smoked sausage and corn dog category. Our brand strength relative to our peers is undeniable as Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete. Many of our retail businesses continue to outperform total food and beverage and remain highly relevant to consumers and therefore, elevated in consumption. Consumers will continue to spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. This data shows the recovery we're seeing versus a year ago and the momentum we are gaining as we move into fiscal 2023. We have made steady progress improving fill rates and on-shelf availability as we focus on serving our current customers and attracting new customers to grow our distribution and volume. Additionally, we took various degrees of pricing in our key categories earlier this fiscal year to offset inflationary cost pressures. Recently, we have seen competitors followed by increasing their prices nearing Tyson's price gap relative to our competitors. This is supporting improved volume performance across our portfolio of prepared foods products as we are continuing to see price elasticities remain below historical levels. We're investing strategically in merchandising and advertising to support the long-term health of our brands as their strength enables continued growth in both, dollar and volume retail share. These factors, along with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in many of our key retail category and we expect our retail share growth to continue. While the foodservice industry has yet to recover to pre-pandemic traffic levels, the Tyson Focus 6 group is outpacing both total broadline and respective categories and volume sales, up 18.9% and 0.9 share points in the last 52 weeks compared to last year according to NPD supply track data. The Tyson Focus 6 group composed of value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon and Philly Steak is also up 1.7 volume share points in the last 52 weeks compared to pre-pandemic levels. We believe strongly in our foodservice portfolio and are confident there is immediate and long-term growth ahead of this business as we align with key growing customers and execute our strategy across all categories to build momentum for the future. Our team members are essential to providing the products to our customers and consumers demand. Staffing levels and the impact on operational throughput were a challenge in our business. We continue to make significant investments in our team members' experience, prioritizing these three key areas of health, safety and well-being of our team members, total rewards and team member growth and our One Tyson culture with digitalization as a key enabler. We're now seeing business results from investing in becoming the most sought after place to work. Examples of these investments are free education, child care solutions, citizenship support, transportation, maternity and paternity leave and expanded mental health and well-being benefits. In August, we received national recognition for our innovative ridesharing program benefiting team members across the nation. The program provides an option for team members who may have difficulty assessing reliable transportation to get to work and is improving their quality of life. Investments in enhanced benefits, digitalized processes and tools and career growth opportunities for our team members are paying off. In October, we announced our One Tyson corporate office consolidation to world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. The move will enable excellence and execution by bringing our corporate business unit roles together on one campus, driving a culture that optimizes collaboration, innovation, accelerate speed and facilitates career growth for our team members. The feedback we've received from our customers for this change has been well received. These investments we're making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from an environmental, social and governance perspective. Today, we are focused on 3 core pillars of our ESG framework, the formula to feed the future. Those 3 pillars are reimagining people and community impact, driving product responsibility from farm to table and working toward achieving net zero. In July, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition to become the world's most sustainable and transparent protein company. In addition to the investments in people mentioned, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, minimizing waste, water stewardship and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce emissions. Significant progress was achieved in the past fiscal year in improving our scores and metrics within ESG rating agencies. We are particularly proud of a more than 30% increase in our Dow Jones Sustainability Index score year-over-year, and we're taking more steps to continue to improve our standing with ESG stakeholders. In the past fiscal year, our productivity program outperformed on our commitments, delivering over $700 million in savings impact across all components of our business. This performance indicates how Tyson has remained focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing our supply chain and increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations. We expect the productivity program will continue to outperform our original expectations of more than $1 billion in recurring savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. The program is now on track to deliver this commitment by the end of fiscal year 2023, a year earlier than expected. As mentioned before, these recurring savings support the partial offset of inflationary pressures while at the same time, improving our competitiveness in the marketplace. Automation remains a top priority, and I'm very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation technologies across all segments in fiscal year 2022, including continuing to scale debone automation in our poultry operations and pack-out automation across all businesses. I will now turn the call over to John to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the fourth quarter.\nJohn R. Tyson: Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're pleased to report resilient fourth quarter and record annual performance in the fiscal year. Sales were up for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in cost of goods. Volumes were up for the fourth quarter and relatively flat for the full year as we overcame supply constraints in an elevated inflationary environment pressuring consumer demand. Looking at our sales results by channel for the fiscal year. Retail drove $1.4 billion of top line improvement, while the ongoing recovery in the foodservice channel drove an increase of $2 billion. Fiscal year sales in international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products, were $1.3 billion greater than the prior year as we leverage our global scale to grow our business. Donnie covered our operating income and earnings per share results, so I won't repeat. Slide 16 bridges operating income for the fiscal year, which was $126 million greater than the fiscal 2021. We significantly improved earnings in our Chicken segment and generated higher earnings in Prepared Foods, which more than offset the expected decline in Beef earnings. Our pricing actions, which offset the higher input costs, led to higher sales during the year. We saw notable year-over-year increases of 20% to 25% across the business in cost of goods, including labor, feed ingredients, live animals and freight costs. Investment in growth is our priority. To facilitate this growth, an additional $80 million in SG&A expenses compared to last fiscal year was invested in team members, marketing, advertising and promotional spend to support our brand and digitalization initiatives, among other things. While SG&A expenses increased, SG&A as a percentage of total sales was down to 4.2% from 4.5% in the prior fiscal year, reflecting our continued focus on assessing all expenses across the business to identify non-value-added spend and continuing to build leverage across the scale of our business. As mentioned by Donnie, we significantly accelerated our productivity actions to improve efficiency across all segments during the past year, which has had a meaningful positive impact on our margin profile. Our year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports our growth objectives of growing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders. Now moving to the Beef segment. Sales were approximately $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3% versus the same period last year, but up 10% for the fiscal year at nearly $20 billion. Sales in the quarter remained strong, supported by higher volume, but offset by lower average sales price. Global consumer demand for beef products remains strong. We expect volumes to remain stable next year amid tightening supply of cattle, offset by improved labor participation, supporting higher plant productivity. On expenses, we incurred greater costs during the fiscal year compared to the prior year as live cattle costs increased approximately $2 billion. But we have sufficient livestock available to finish the year, and we continue to have ample supply to support our operations. We delivered segment operating income of $2.5 billion for the year, and our fiscal year operating margin of 12.5% was a very strong performance by historical standards. We still expect future beef margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% over the long term. Looking next to the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter and $6.4 billion for the fiscal year, down 3% and up 2%, respectively, versus the prior year. Global demand remains challenged by high domestic retail prices and the strong U.S. dollar, making U.S. pork relatively expensive as compared to alternative sources globally. For the year, the average sales price increased 4.1%, offsetting the decrease in volume of 1.9%. We expect these headwinds to impact pork volumes next year to a lesser extent than the past year. Segment operating income and margins were $198 million and 3.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year. The operating income deterioration was driven by herd health issues negatively impacting hog costs and a constrained cut out compressing pork margins in the elevated inflationary environment, increasing operating costs overall. While the Q4 result was negative operating income, we do expect to flip back to positive returns in Q1. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 12% relative to the same period last year. For the fiscal year, sales increased 9.4%, driven by the higher average sales price increase of 13.5%, partially offset by the volume decline of 4.1%, in which 0.9% of the decline was due to the sale of our pet treats business. Volume performance improved in the fourth quarter as our investments in brands and merchandising drove an increase in portfolio market share. Our fourth quarter result, which was roughly flat versus last year, was our strongest performance this year and better than the competition, which underscores the strength of our brands. We expect volume to grow sequentially next year, driven by foodservice recovery, improved supply and continued investment in our brands. Operating margin for the segment was 5.8% or $147 million for the quarter, up 4.1% compared to last year. For the fiscal year, our operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.5% compared to the prior year at $782 million. Now, on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.6 billion for the quarter, up 19%. And for the full year, sales were up 24% at $17 billion. Volumes improved both for the quarter and fiscal year as we gained momentum in the improvement of our live operations. We expect this operational improvement to continue driving sequential quarterly volume growth into next fiscal year. Average sales price increased by approximately 18% for both the quarter and the fiscal year compared to last year. Our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures, allowing us to be more agile in response to market conditions was a key decision by our management team. Chicken delivered operating income of $337 million or 7.3% for the fourth quarter and $926 million or 5.5% margin for the total fiscal year. Respectively, this represents margin improvement of 10.2% and 5.3% over the prior year comparable periods. This quarter, we surpassed our goal of processing 40 million head per week by the end of the fiscal year. We intend to continue to grow next year to 42 million head per week, enabling us to maximize our fixed cost leverage and grow market share along with our value-added business. With live operations on a positive trajectory, we will continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our Chicken segment. I am pleased with the tremendous progress we have made against our road map to restoring competitiveness in this business. However, there's still work to do to attain industry-leading performance, and I look forward to more great things to come from the team on this one. Now turning to slide 20. Our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support our disciplined capital allocation approach with a focus on total shareholder return. We remain focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members and business and returning cash to shareholders. We produced $2.7 billion of operating cash flows in fiscal year \u201822. This is after funding a $2.1 billion increase in working capital, which included an investment of $1 billion in inventory to better service our customers as well as the impact of cost inflation. Additionally, we had other planned working capital outflows associated with taxes paid on the divestiture of our pet treats business, payment of a portion of deferred payroll taxes from the CARES Act and the settlement of certain legal accruals. Our leverage ratio finished the year at 1.3 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority as we utilize a disciplined capital allocation and balance sheet management approach to invest in desirable projects, brands, categories and geographies. We also maintain a disciplined M&A approach, investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio or our growth objectives, such as the recent acquisition in Saudi Arabia, providing access to the growing Halal market. While M&A will always be a consideration for growth, we're focused first on investing in growth in our existing footprint. This will facilitate Tyson increasing production capacity, market capabilities and profitability, providing return on capital generation above the market and at a minimum of 12% return on invested capital for our shareholders as our long-term target. To address projected demand growth over the next decade, we invested $1.9 billion in our business in the past fiscal year, focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives. Finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. For the fiscal year, we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through $653 million in dividends and $702 million of share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return. Let's now discuss the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. We anticipate total company sales between $55 billion and $57 billion, and also expect volume growth compared to the prior fiscal year. Both total company sales and volume growth in fiscal '23 will largely be driven by our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses as we work to run our plants full, optimizing our existing footprint and utilizing new capacity expansions. To grow volumes in our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses, construction is in progress of six new plants, all to be in operation by the end of fiscal 2023. We're building a value-added chicken plant in Danville, Virginia, and we're growing our bacon business with a new location in Bowling Green, Kentucky. And we're also expanding our footprint and increasing volumes outside the U.S. with three plants going live in China and one in Malaysia during 2023. These investments in the recently announced joint venture partnerships are fueling future growth, both organically and inorganically in our international business. We remain focused on growing internationally and on those fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. Now, as we touched on earlier, our productivity program is expected to deliver an additional $300 million to $400 million of savings during fiscal 2023 as we build upon the foundation laid across the enterprise this year with focus on operational and functional excellence, digital solutions and programmatic automation initiatives. To continue to capitalize upon the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect to increase CapEx spending to approximately $2.5 billion during fiscal 2023 to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profile. We currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23%, and we anticipate net interest expense of approximately $320 million. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our minimum target and net leverage is expected to remain below 2 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. We expect strong and meaningfully better operating cash flows in fiscal 2023 as we do not expect to invest as much in working capital as experienced in the past fiscal year. Now, finally, let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to our total company performance. As mentioned earlier, we continue to expect future Beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% for the long term. However, based on current market dynamics, we expect fiscal 2023 to be at or below the low end of that range. In Pork, we expect return on sales between 2% and 4%. Due to normal seasonality for our Pork segment, we expect the front half of the year to outperform the back half of the year. We continue to invest behind our expanded case-ready capacity, increasing volume through organic growth with new and existing customers, underpinned by product innovation for both our Beef and Pork segments. Prepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal 2023 between 8% and 10%, driven by volume growth, productivity and disciplined revenue management. We expect volume, sales revenue and operating income to all increase through the fiscal year with stronger quarters in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. In Chicken, our operational turnaround progress as forecasted, and we are now increasing our focus on optimizing our mix to maximize profitability of our value-added portfolio. We expect to deliver full year margins of 6% to 8%, driven primarily by progressively growing volume and sales revenue while at the same time realizing additional operational improvements. And in international, we anticipate improved profitability from our operations in fiscal 2023, driven by volume growth from capacity expansions ramping up. Our segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling roles within Tyson's portfolio strategy. We make products that provide options for consumers across proteins and up and down the value chain, delivering performance that supports the Company's long-term earnings objectives and desirable returns for shareholders. To sum it up, fiscal 2022 was a record year in revenue, operating income and EPS. And as a result, we are in a strong financial position as we enter fiscal 2023 to support continued investment in our existing footprint, new capacity expansion, more automation and support for our brands as we continue to grow our business. Now, before I turn the call over for your questions, I want to take a moment to address an important issue. I'm sure you've seen the news about the recent incident involving me. I'm embarrassed and I want to let you know that I take full responsibility for my actions. I also want to apologize to our investors as I have to our employees. This was an incident inconsistent with our company values as well as my personal values. I just wanted you guys to hear this directly from me and to know that I'm committed to making sure this never happens again. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Donnie. Donnie?\nDonnie King: Thanks, John. I would like to take a moment to make one final point. Like John, the Company takes this matter seriously. Tyson Foods has a strong, robust corporate governance process. Our independent Board of Directors are overseeing a thorough review of this matter, and I'm confident in this independent process. With this said, and before I turn the call back over to Brandon for your questions, I'd like to remind you that 2022 was a record year for sales for operating income as well as EPS, and we look forward to a strong 2023.\nBrandon Tucker: Thanks, Donnie. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: So, I guess my first question is thinking about the outlook for fiscal 2023 in Beef and you're kind of staying at or below the low end of the normalized range. Clearly, there's been some herd liquidation that's been happening in the U.S. industry, cattle prices have risen. I guess, I'm trying to understand if we're already at or below the low end of that normalized range, the cattle herd was going to keep -- is going to keep shrinking. Can you help us think about how we would ever get -- how we would get back to that normalized range in the next few years with the smaller herd? Talk about kind of what you're doing from productivity, from a mixed, case-ready capacity that would be a balance to margins and what would seem like a more challenging kind of multiyear outlook?\nJohn R. Tyson: Hey Adam, this is John, and thanks for the question. I think, look, first, I'd reiterate what we see as the long-term guidance for the Beef business. And we -- that's a full outlook for the year, long term. We're not, at this point, going to give quarterly guidance. And what I think I'd say is we're at Tyson, not necessarily immune to the cattle cycle, but there are a couple of things I'd point out that maybe make this cycle a little bit different. Number one, we see the quality, generally speaking, around the industry is stronger and better that has kind of supported demand for beef cattle. I think secondly, the global demand is pretty strong. That's a little bit tempered by FX that we're seeing in our business. But generally speaking, I think that makes this cycle that we're heading into a slightly different. I'll let Shane maybe comment on some of the investments we're making around the business and give a little more detail as it relates to the outlook on Beef.\nShane Miller: Thanks for the question, Adam. John touched on a couple of things that I think to think about that's a bit different this cycle versus previous cycles is one. John touched on the cattle quality, that's extremely different this go around than the last time we went through this cycle. The second component is globally beef has remained and still has been a strong demand product that's going into different channels throughout Asia. And also, we're seeing interest from different parts of the globe that historically have not been big buyers of U.S. beef. And then finally, if you think about the -- even though we do have a strong quality that's coming out of the meat products, but you have items such as our specialty products, fat and oils are off all items, items like that that typically haven't been large contributors that this go around are significant contributors. So, if you think of it in direction in relationship to the last cycle, I think we have an opportunity here to scale in here and do much better than the last go around. So I think all those things coupled together give us confidence and hope that we're going to continue to be able to drive this type of return.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just maybe switch gears to the chicken business. And if you think about the exit margins coming out of fiscal fourth quarter and 7.3%. Can you just help us think about the trajectory of chicken from here? I think there was some mark-to-market derivative of gains in the quarter. But how do we think about the volume scaling kind of mix contribution? And help us think about kind of what would get you to the 8% versus the 6% at the upper and lower bounds of your guidance range.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Adam. This is Donnie. Thanks for the question. The Chicken turnaround continues. We've made a lot of progress. David and his team have got our chicken business in a better place than it's been in some time. But we haven't arrived yet. There's still things to do. And we get better sequentially each quarter and would expect that to continue. I would point out that we're guiding to a 6% to 8% for '23, and we feel very good about that. And we feel good about investing in our Tyson brand and continuing to use that. But let me just flip it over to David. And this is a guy who's been doing all the work, and he and his team -- and let him add some additional color for you.\nDavid Bray: Perfect, Donnie. Thank you very much. And you said it very well. We have made progress in 2022, but we've got a considerable amount of work to do as we get into 2023. But it's also important to understand that our goals have not changed within this segment, and we are aligned on not only making sure that we service our customers, but we run our facilities and capacity. And that's incredibly important to us as we move into 2023. As a team, we're focused on making sure that our customers are serviced, that we fill our plants and that we're taking care of our team members. And in total, we've got a very strong plan for 2023. And John mentioned the guidance between 6% to 8%, and we feel very good about the plan we have in place to deliver those numbers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.\nBen Bienvenu: So I want to ask about the Prepared Foods business, and you talked about the cadence of improvements that we should expect as we move through the year. Could you talk about the critical path to achieve that cadence of improvement through the year? And if we think about the pricing that you've taken today, is that sufficient to cover the costs to get to that 8% to 10% range, or is there additional pricing that you might need to take?\nDonnie King: Let me just say that -- and I'll pass it over to Stewart to add some commentary. We guided to 8% to 10% in 2023. And behind productivity, capacity utilization and mix improvements, we anticipate improved volume sales and AOI for '23. Our foodservice recovery is a little slower pace than expected, but we feel very good about this segment and the performance. And I'm personally very proud that we have Stewart leading this business. And Stewart, why don't you add some comments?\nStewart Glendinning: I'd start by saying that it's great to run this business because when you look at the construct of the Prepared Foods business, on the retail side out of the 9 categories, we've got the number 1 position in 8 and on the foodservice side, we're in, I think, about 19 categories or so there. But -- and in the majority of those, we've got the number 1 position. So we're really starting from a position of strength just from a portfolio standpoint. You look at the way this year has gone, we took pricing earlier in the year. And so, as we went through the year, of course, we had continued inflation. So, looking to the back part of this -- of '23, as we go through '23, we're going to be recovering from the 5.8% to get up to the 8. And that's really going to have a couple of big drivers. The first one and the most important is volume. If you look back in the volume history, we shared last quarter that we'd lost some foodservice volume. We're working on getting that back. Our fill rates, we still have an opportunity in fill rates. And so there's volume that's actually sitting in our order queue that we can go and get and we're working on that and seeing improvement week over week. As the pricing, we'll see how the year goes. In this fourth quarter, we saw a strong volume performance. Some of that came on the back of increased promotions. But I'd note that our promotions were in line with our competition. So, back half of the year, probably the last point to make is we've got pretty strong plans for cost reduction this year, and that will also contribute to getting us to the 8% to 10%.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Great. And if I could circle back to the chicken business, I believe your goal that you laid out at the Investor Day in 2021 was to be at an 84% hatch rate as of kind of around right now. Is that where you are? Are you on track? You mentioned commentary in your slides that you're on track with your hatch improvement goals. Are we kind of now at a new cruising level and shouldn't expect further improvement from here, or could that continue to improve, would you want it to?\nDavid Bray: We are well on track. We are very pleased with the work that our live team has done in getting this put back in a position where we're no longer having daily conversations about what our hatch rates are. So, we are on track and feel good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Can I ask about the productivity savings program? You obviously overdelivered in fiscal '22 relative to where you were expecting to get to. Can you talk about what it was that went better than expected? And I guess linked to that, a second question, if the automation part is going faster than expected, how quickly is total employee count coming down? And how much more is there to go on that front? Thank you.\nDonnie King: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, the productivity program, as we laid it out, it was a 3-year program, and we're well ahead of that in 2022. And we talked about this in terms of really 3 buckets. Automation is obviously one of those, digital is another, and then operational and functional excellence. And all of those are working together really, really well. We think we'll meet our commitment by the end of this fiscal year '23. But it seems like every rock we turn over, we find something new and we capture that, and we'll continue to do that. The automation piece specifically is progressing faster than what we had planned. And of course, we're happy about that. But -- and remember, the automation piece was to eliminate some laborious difficult, high turnover type of positions. And in the program, as I think it was in the script that I mentioned in chicken, the debone automation project. But we also, in this programmatic approach to automation, where we have focused in our pack-out area. And we've also launched our digital enablement group as we take technology throughout Tyson. And we're progressing on all of those, and we'll update you each and every quarter on how we're doing in that area.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And anything on the headcount side of things?\nDonnie King: I have nothing to report on that now. We obviously are eliminating positions and are eliminating difficult jobs, and we are reassigning people to open position throughout the company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Look, those of us who have followed Tyson for a long time are used to the Company putting people with a lot of brand management expertise in charge of Prepared Foods because it's a heavily branded food portfolio. And putting people into the CFO role who have 20-plus years of experience in the finance track and this latest reshuffling did the opposite. Can you speak to how the organization is responding culturally to these decisions, especially in light of the fact that you're also closing down two of your headquarters, consolidating into Springdale. Donnie, what are you doing to mitigate execution risk during this kind of high turmoil period?\nDonnie King: Thank you. In short, we have a plan. Let's start with the office consolidation that you referenced. This is something that we've talked about. We've looked at for a number of years now. And we made the decision to do that in an effort to be a better version of ourselves. We're still working through trying to finalize which team members are moving and which ones are not. We certainly realize it's a difficult decision for those team members, and we're committed to providing the resources and the way we've characterized that here at Tyson is we're trying to help those team members, and it's about 1,100 of them, to be able to find the yes in terms of being able to move here and with their families. And I would just characterize it as integration a few years later. And there's opportunity obviously that we see in terms of being better, being more agile and delivering better results, being more productive, all those type attributes. And in order to get that, we had to do our project concept. Now, in terms of the people, I would remind you, at Tyson, we have a -- our succession planning process is very robust. And we're working that program. It's a living document, and we did, to your point, make some decisions. I would start with I am very pleased with the decisions that we've made around John Randal, around Stewart and Amy Tu. These are very talented individuals and all of them have experience in other areas that -- and then they brought that to Tyson. So, we're comfortable with the team that we've got. The team feels good with the leaders that they have. And I already see great progress in the work that they're doing. And -- but we're -- I'm perfectly comfortable with the people we put in place.\nRobert Moskow: I appreciate that, Donnie. Maybe a follow-up. When do you expect to be able to give more clarity to those 1,100 people? In my experience, people who want to know stuff like that sooner than later, how quickly can you move?\nDonnie King: Sure. So I think the thing that you need to know about that is we've been working and meeting almost on a daily basis. We put together a team to execute the plan that we have in place. We've invited every team member to join us here in Northwest Arkansas. And that's open. We've asked them to commit to us what their intentions are. And in fact, today, I don't know the numbers yet, but today was the day at which we needed to know that. And we really approached this in a couple of different ways. One is we want you to be here. We want you to remain a part of Tyson Foods. And quite frankly, I've been out recruiting people to, as other leaders have, to come to Northwest Arkansas. And we've had a lot of success. There will be some people who, at this point in their life, can't move. And so, we will try to create an opportunity where they can stay with the company long enough so that their replacement could be hired and trained so that we have no business interruption or interruption of business continuity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays.\nAntonio Hern\u00e1ndez: This is Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez on behalf of Ben Theurer. My question is regarding your CapEx plans for the next year. You provided some color on that, but could you provide a little bit more breakdown on the different items that you're spending and what should we expect more in the medium to long term? Thanks.\nJohn R. Tyson: Hey, there. You're kind of muffled on our end. I think your question was about CapEx and just wondering if we could expand upon that. Is that right?\nAntonio Hern\u00e1ndez: Exactly. Yes.\nJohn R. Tyson: Sure thing. Well, I think, look, what we've talked to you about already this morning is our plans for a heavier investment in our business compared to historical years. And I think in a small part, that's driven a little bit about the inflationary environment that we're in. But really, I think the point we want you to take away is that we see a lot of opportunity in our business in terms of productivity improvements, things like automation and a little bit of capacity expansion. So, as it relates to priorities, I would tell you that in our value-added segments, we're trying to grow capacity and some of our chicken, prepared foods and fresh meats businesses, we see opportunities for network optimization. So, I don't think it's any departure from what you would expect us to be investing in, a decent balance of growth and productivity investments. I would emphasize, back to the question that someone asked earlier, automation is a huge part of our agenda. And what we like about those investments is we see sustained productivity as we reapportion team members to different parts of our operations. And so, we feel really confident in some of the more programmatic investments we're making around our automation agenda.\nOperator: My next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: I wanted to ask about your guidance for the sales range of $55 billion to $57 billion. I do appreciate that there are six new plants coming on and that you'll have some additional pricing and some mix improvements. I guess one of the questions we're getting from investors this morning is, is it reasonable to expect the high end of that range, just given some of the potential trade down coming as consumers potentially face some more challenges and more importantly, where we're seeing chicken prices today? So I guess I'm curious if you can expand a little bit perhaps on how much production the six new plants are expected to cumulatively add? I think that would help people really kind of maybe bridge the gap there to that higher end perhaps?\nDonnie King: Let me start off, Ken, and say this. I mean, we feel very confident in the -- what we've laid out in terms of outlook. Could we move to the higher side? Perhaps. But we're guiding to have a really, really good year. We factored in things like inflation. We factored in growing share in both dollar and volume. We've included all those things in terms of the drought and the conditions that we're seeing in the Beef segment, the strength of the dollar from an export position. So, in short, I would tell you that we've considered all those things in coming up with this plan. And we rolled it up as a team, and we all signed off on it. But I'll pass it to John and see if he wants to...\nJohn R. Tyson: Yes, Donnie, I think that was a fair summary. I mean, there's a balance in that projection between the volume growth and what we see from a sales growth from a pricing standpoint. And I think that we feel confident in the mix between those two things to achieve the range that we gave. You also asked a question about what's the capacity coming on line with the new build. And I think without going into details of each of those operations, a little bit of that is dependent on the timing of when things come online in '23. But I think overall, what we want you to take away is that we feel confident in the range at this standpoint as a roll-up of multiple factors that go into the numbers.\nKen Goldman: Okay. And then a quick follow-up. You obviously have done really well with getting your productivity at an accelerated pace. I don't think -- and forgive me if I missed this, you did talk about productivity after '23. Previously, you had kind of guided into '24. Is it fair to assume that there will be still significant productivity savings after '23 now that you've pulled those forward a little bit? And if so, when might we get a little bit of color on the dollar percentage amount there?\nDonnie King: So, great question. First thing I would say to you is we had a good '22, and we feel very good about delivering a year early in '23. Our nature is that we are -- have a continuous improvement mindset. So, we will identify and continue to identify opportunities to become more productive, become more efficient to run lines at rate better to automate, do all those type of things that will continue to bring money to the bottom line. We feel good about that, and I think you could expect that we would have another program or continuation of this program. I don't know what that is at this moment. John, anything?\nJohn R. Tyson: No, nothing to add, Donnie. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America.\nPeter Galbo: John, I just wanted to maybe clarify a couple of points you made on the volume growth assumptions between some of the segments. I think what you're calling for in Chicken is maybe like a 5% growth in '23, just given the weekly slaughter levels. Just wanted to check that. And then on beef, I wanted to make sure I heard you correctly, even with USDA kind of calling for down mid-single-digit on volumes, you were thinking you could be relatively stable. I don't know if that meant flat for the year or how you were thinking about that.\nJohn R. Tyson: Sure. I think, look, we've kind of tried to give some overall indications on volume as it relates to the various segments. And there's a lot of factors that go into the sales and AOI numbers we're looking at, part of which is volume. I think in our poultry business, we do feel comfortable about the sequential growth directionally speaking, that we're talking about as we head into FY23. And I think on the Beef business, even amidst the total environment and USDA calling out the harvest, I think what I'd point to is some of the investments we make in terms of our business model around our relationships with suppliers, investments in kind of the value-added parts of our business and continuing to grow in specific channels. I think we see it as critical to preserving the outlook for '23. Shane, maybe you have a little bit to add on the Beef segment.\nShane Miller: Yes. Peter, I think one of the things to keep in mind, too, when you look at beef is you're lapping a period a year ago with still a COVID-induced reduction in volumes. And we've seen our operations get back to -- we're getting 5 days of animals harvested, processed in 5 days and 6 days really turned into a flex day. So on top of that from the supply component, you're right. I mean, we are in the middle of the drought still, and we're seeing drought-induced movement into the feed yards continues to show lower weights at placement, which in a sense means that cattle are being pulled forward and so forth. So as you look forward here into the next several months, I mean we're still going to have plenty of animals to work through.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. No. Thanks. That's very helpful. And Donnie, I guess just to follow-up on Ken's last question around chicken. Just given that you have transitioned more of your contracts to a more variable pricing structure, what we've seen in the spot markets in terms of pricing, can you just kind of remind us where you stand today in terms of how commodity markets or commodity chicken markets might impact pricing relative to history where maybe it wasn't as impactful to your business?\nDonnie King: Let me -- I'll mention a few things, and then I'll let David add some additional color. Yes, we feel very good about that. I would remind you that in our portfolio, the percentage of our portfolio that is value-added is significant. And a significant portion of that is branded. And so we have a lot more discretion with that. Some of the pricing variability is essentially more associated with some of the segments like fresh chicken or things like that. But we feel very good. And if you go back and look at us through history, you will find when the market goes up really high in breast meat -- and I think a quarter or so ago, breast meat was trading at around $2.60 and you can buy that for about $0.90 today. You know what, we never got the high of that based on our model, and we never get the lows either. So, we trade within a range here, and we have, on purpose and have more -- or better, more predictable results. David?\nDavid Bray: Donnie, I think that was perfect, especially when you talk about our exposure and the amount of big bird breast meat that we actually have a part of. But the other piece to that is we have great customers Tyson Foods. And what we've done within our variable pricing is provided us the opportunity to have more consistent conversations with them about the things that make their prices go up and the things that make their prices go down. And we'll continue to have those conversations despite soft times and seasonality. So, a lot of progress has been made against that. And again, we've done a lot of work to shift into more of a value-added mix.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with BMO.\nKen Zaslow: Hey John, Stewart, can you kind of tell us, as you enter the new role, what is your key actions you expect to do within the next, call it, 6 to 12 months? And how you think that role for you will evolve? And what contribution you will actually have to the changes that need to be done?\nJohn R. Tyson: Hey Ken, this is John. Maybe let me answer that question first. And I think the first thing I'd point out, just as it relates to kind of the overall leadership team here, as you know, I've been on the executive team for going on a few years now and involved in the senior leadership level for more than that. So, I don't think from a capital allocation standpoint or a strategy standpoint, you should expect too many significant changes or departures from how things have been handled in the past. I guess that's the first point I'd make. Stewart and I are sitting here next to the -- stylistically, you might see a few differences between the two of us. But I think overall, I think the direction of the Company stays the same. I think check back with me in a quarter or two to see if there's any new ideas. But I think overall, I'll just provide the perspective that I think that these leadership moves are kind of both for continuity rather than radical change of any kind.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Ken, maybe first just with the background point. I spent 13 years before this in the beer business, 10 of those as an executive officer, four of those as the CFO running in the branded businesses. So I'm coming to this business with a good knowledge of brands, and I'm excited to run what is a powerful part of our portfolio. When I look at the business, I see huge opportunity mainly because the platform is so strong. Starting off, if you look at the volume performance [Technical Difficulty] the last number of years, while share has been good, volume could be stronger. And so as I started to this job, I see real opportunity for volume improvement, particularly in the foodservice business and I'm pressing hard against that. That means filling the orders we already have and it means selling out the capacity that exists in our network. And both of those have a big -- have a big opportunity in our company. I also, by the way, look at our cost structures and believe that we've got the ability to run our business in a leaner way and still achieve the growth goals that we want to see in the company. And then, I'd probably finish up by saying that I further believe that on the innovation side, we have lots of runway and lots of opportunity to press hard in the market. So, I come into role with both, confidence and believing that we have a strong pathway ahead.\nDonnie King: If I might, Ken, just a couple of things. Stewart touched in fairly great detail his prior experience, and he does have great experience coming into Tyson. But John Randal, he's had experience outside of Tyson. He's had escalating levels of responsibility and banking and venture capitalism prior to joining Tyson. But you may not know that within Tyson for the last four years, he's led the M&A strategy, ventures and other areas of the Company. So -- but don't forget about the fact that he's been involved in this business essentially his whole life. So, a lot of experience there. Let me mention Amy Tu, which you didn't ask about very specifically. But Amy came to us with a great deal of global leadership outside of Tyson with Boeing and Walmart. She has strong experience in M&A, strategy and commercial as well as the legal background. And she's a very talented person. And I'm very happy with what I'm seeing out of all three of these today, and I think they will make us a better Tyson as we move forward.\nKen Zaslow: Great. I was not minimizing the experience. I just wanted to see the actions, particularly in Prepared Foods because I sense that you're in the 8% margin and you're kind of wanting to go to that 8% to 10% but it sounds like there's a little bit of a touch on operational efficiencies. My second question would be, as I think about the longer term, and I know there was an allusion to how you can actually get back to the midpoint of the range. What are the concrete actions that you can do, or is it really dependent on the market in terms of just making sure that China remains a key exporter? Because that's the single biggest thing that's changed over the last couple of years. So, is it the new environment that you think will get you back there, or do you think that there is internal actions that can be taken to put you back into that margin structure?\nDonnie King: Let me -- Ken, thank you. Let me just say a couple of things. We think we have a bit of a different business model than we had, let's say, in 2015, when we went through the drought last time. It's already been talked about today in terms of our relationship with these producers that provide us with this better quality grading animals that we have. I think it's also important to remind you about the global demand is better than previous cycles. People outside the United States are looking for high-quality, grain-fed U.S. beef. And so, we're able to meet that. But we've also invested heavily to be able to take boxed beef up the value chain with our investment most recently in Eagle Mountain, Utah and also in Columbia, South Carolina. So, we continue to take beef and pork up the value chain. And so we feel better. We feel -- the drought is real. We see that. We're not kidding ourselves about that, but we intend to manage through it and perform better than we did the last time through. Shane?\nShane Miller: Yes. Thanks for the question. Donnie, I think you hit on all the key points. The only thing I would mention is no matter what the market conditions are or the cattle supply, we feel good about all these investments to differentiate our beef business model. And on top of that, if you think about the investments that we've made and we are making into our supply chain on beef and cattle sustainability, these are key important topics that our customers and ultimately, the consumer are asking about. And we feel really good about what we're doing there, telling the story back up into the feed yard, but even further back into the ranch and to maintain and preserve resources and have focused on sustainability for the future.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.\nDonnie King: We have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins, channels and geographies. We are improving operational efficiencies and have a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. For these reasons, we are confident we will grow revenue and maintain strong profitability in fiscal year 2023 and have future long-term growth ahead of us. At Tyson, we're focused on making food affordable, accessible and nutritious for customers and consumers around the world. Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking again soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John R. Tyson",
            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're pleased to report resilient fourth quarter and record annual performance in the fiscal year. Sales were up for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in cost of goods. Volumes were up for the fourth quarter and relatively flat for the full year as we overcame supply constraints in an elevated inflationary environment pressuring consumer demand. Looking at our sales results by channel for the fiscal year. Retail drove $1.4 billion of top line improvement, while the ongoing recovery in the foodservice channel drove an increase of $2 billion. Fiscal year sales in international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products, were $1.3 billion greater than the prior year as we leverage our global scale to grow our business. Donnie covered our operating income and earnings per share results, so I won't repeat. Slide 16 bridges operating income for the fiscal year, which was $126 million greater than the fiscal 2021. We significantly improved earnings in our Chicken segment and generated higher earnings in Prepared Foods, which more than offset the expected decline in Beef earnings. Our pricing actions, which offset the higher input costs, led to higher sales during the year. We saw notable year-over-year increases of 20% to 25% across the business in cost of goods, including labor, feed ingredients, live animals and freight costs. Investment in growth is our priority. To facilitate this growth, an additional $80 million in SG&A expenses compared to last fiscal year was invested in team members, marketing, advertising and promotional spend to support our brand and digitalization initiatives, among other things. While SG&A expenses increased, SG&A as a percentage of total sales was down to 4.2% from 4.5% in the prior fiscal year, reflecting our continued focus on assessing all expenses across the business to identify non-value-added spend and continuing to build leverage across the scale of our business. As mentioned by Donnie, we significantly accelerated our productivity actions to improve efficiency across all segments during the past year, which has had a meaningful positive impact on our margin profile. Our year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports our growth objectives of growing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders. Now moving to the Beef segment. Sales were approximately $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter, down 3% versus the same period last year, but up 10% for the fiscal year at nearly $20 billion. Sales in the quarter remained strong, supported by higher volume, but offset by lower average sales price. Global consumer demand for beef products remains strong. We expect volumes to remain stable next year amid tightening supply of cattle, offset by improved labor participation, supporting higher plant productivity. On expenses, we incurred greater costs during the fiscal year compared to the prior year as live cattle costs increased approximately $2 billion. But we have sufficient livestock available to finish the year, and we continue to have ample supply to support our operations. We delivered segment operating income of $2.5 billion for the year, and our fiscal year operating margin of 12.5% was a very strong performance by historical standards. We still expect future beef margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% over the long term. Looking next to the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter and $6.4 billion for the fiscal year, down 3% and up 2%, respectively, versus the prior year. Global demand remains challenged by high domestic retail prices and the strong U.S. dollar, making U.S. pork relatively expensive as compared to alternative sources globally. For the year, the average sales price increased 4.1%, offsetting the decrease in volume of 1.9%. We expect these headwinds to impact pork volumes next year to a lesser extent than the past year. Segment operating income and margins were $198 million and 3.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year. The operating income deterioration was driven by herd health issues negatively impacting hog costs and a constrained cut out compressing pork margins in the elevated inflationary environment, increasing operating costs overall. While the Q4 result was negative operating income, we do expect to flip back to positive returns in Q1. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 12% relative to the same period last year. For the fiscal year, sales increased 9.4%, driven by the higher average sales price increase of 13.5%, partially offset by the volume decline of 4.1%, in which 0.9% of the decline was due to the sale of our pet treats business. Volume performance improved in the fourth quarter as our investments in brands and merchandising drove an increase in portfolio market share. Our fourth quarter result, which was roughly flat versus last year, was our strongest performance this year and better than the competition, which underscores the strength of our brands. We expect volume to grow sequentially next year, driven by foodservice recovery, improved supply and continued investment in our brands. Operating margin for the segment was 5.8% or $147 million for the quarter, up 4.1% compared to last year. For the fiscal year, our operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.5% compared to the prior year at $782 million. Now, on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.6 billion for the quarter, up 19%. And for the full year, sales were up 24% at $17 billion. Volumes improved both for the quarter and fiscal year as we gained momentum in the improvement of our live operations. We expect this operational improvement to continue driving sequential quarterly volume growth into next fiscal year. Average sales price increased by approximately 18% for both the quarter and the fiscal year compared to last year. Our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures, allowing us to be more agile in response to market conditions was a key decision by our management team. Chicken delivered operating income of $337 million or 7.3% for the fourth quarter and $926 million or 5.5% margin for the total fiscal year. Respectively, this represents margin improvement of 10.2% and 5.3% over the prior year comparable periods. This quarter, we surpassed our goal of processing 40 million head per week by the end of the fiscal year. We intend to continue to grow next year to 42 million head per week, enabling us to maximize our fixed cost leverage and grow market share along with our value-added business. With live operations on a positive trajectory, we will continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our Chicken segment. I am pleased with the tremendous progress we have made against our road map to restoring competitiveness in this business. However, there's still work to do to attain industry-leading performance, and I look forward to more great things to come from the team on this one. Now turning to slide 20. Our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support our disciplined capital allocation approach with a focus on total shareholder return. We remain focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members and business and returning cash to shareholders. We produced $2.7 billion of operating cash flows in fiscal year \u201822. This is after funding a $2.1 billion increase in working capital, which included an investment of $1 billion in inventory to better service our customers as well as the impact of cost inflation. Additionally, we had other planned working capital outflows associated with taxes paid on the divestiture of our pet treats business, payment of a portion of deferred payroll taxes from the CARES Act and the settlement of certain legal accruals. Our leverage ratio finished the year at 1.3 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority as we utilize a disciplined capital allocation and balance sheet management approach to invest in desirable projects, brands, categories and geographies. We also maintain a disciplined M&A approach, investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio or our growth objectives, such as the recent acquisition in Saudi Arabia, providing access to the growing Halal market. While M&A will always be a consideration for growth, we're focused first on investing in growth in our existing footprint. This will facilitate Tyson increasing production capacity, market capabilities and profitability, providing return on capital generation above the market and at a minimum of 12% return on invested capital for our shareholders as our long-term target. To address projected demand growth over the next decade, we invested $1.9 billion in our business in the past fiscal year, focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives. Finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. For the fiscal year, we returned nearly $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through $653 million in dividends and $702 million of share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return. Let's now discuss the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. We anticipate total company sales between $55 billion and $57 billion, and also expect volume growth compared to the prior fiscal year. Both total company sales and volume growth in fiscal '23 will largely be driven by our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses as we work to run our plants full, optimizing our existing footprint and utilizing new capacity expansions. To grow volumes in our Chicken, Prepared Foods and International businesses, construction is in progress of six new plants, all to be in operation by the end of fiscal 2023. We're building a value-added chicken plant in Danville, Virginia, and we're growing our bacon business with a new location in Bowling Green, Kentucky. And we're also expanding our footprint and increasing volumes outside the U.S. with three plants going live in China and one in Malaysia during 2023. These investments in the recently announced joint venture partnerships are fueling future growth, both organically and inorganically in our international business. We remain focused on growing internationally and on those fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. Now, as we touched on earlier, our productivity program is expected to deliver an additional $300 million to $400 million of savings during fiscal 2023 as we build upon the foundation laid across the enterprise this year with focus on operational and functional excellence, digital solutions and programmatic automation initiatives. To continue to capitalize upon the organic growth opportunities ahead for our business, we expect to increase CapEx spending to approximately $2.5 billion during fiscal 2023 to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profile. We currently expect our adjusted tax rate to be around 23%, and we anticipate net interest expense of approximately $320 million. Liquidity is expected to significantly exceed our minimum target and net leverage is expected to remain below 2 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. We expect strong and meaningfully better operating cash flows in fiscal 2023 as we do not expect to invest as much in working capital as experienced in the past fiscal year. Now, finally, let's look at how each of our segments will contribute to our total company performance. As mentioned earlier, we continue to expect future Beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% for the long term. However, based on current market dynamics, we expect fiscal 2023 to be at or below the low end of that range. In Pork, we expect return on sales between 2% and 4%. Due to normal seasonality for our Pork segment, we expect the front half of the year to outperform the back half of the year. We continue to invest behind our expanded case-ready capacity, increasing volume through organic growth with new and existing customers, underpinned by product innovation for both our Beef and Pork segments. Prepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal 2023 between 8% and 10%, driven by volume growth, productivity and disciplined revenue management. We expect volume, sales revenue and operating income to all increase through the fiscal year with stronger quarters in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. In Chicken, our operational turnaround progress as forecasted, and we are now increasing our focus on optimizing our mix to maximize profitability of our value-added portfolio. We expect to deliver full year margins of 6% to 8%, driven primarily by progressively growing volume and sales revenue while at the same time realizing additional operational improvements. And in international, we anticipate improved profitability from our operations in fiscal 2023, driven by volume growth from capacity expansions ramping up. Our segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling roles within Tyson's portfolio strategy. We make products that provide options for consumers across proteins and up and down the value chain, delivering performance that supports the Company's long-term earnings objectives and desirable returns for shareholders. To sum it up, fiscal 2022 was a record year in revenue, operating income and EPS. And as a result, we are in a strong financial position as we enter fiscal 2023 to support continued investment in our existing footprint, new capacity expansion, more automation and support for our brands as we continue to grow our business. Now, before I turn the call over for your questions, I want to take a moment to address an important issue. I'm sure you've seen the news about the recent incident involving me. I'm embarrassed and I want to let you know that I take full responsibility for my actions. I also want to apologize to our investors as I have to our employees. This was an incident inconsistent with our company values as well as my personal values. I just wanted you guys to hear this directly from me and to know that I'm committed to making sure this never happens again. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Donnie. Donnie? Hey Adam, this is John, and thanks for the question. I think, look, first, I'd reiterate what we see as the long-term guidance for the Beef business. And we -- that's a full outlook for the year, long term. We're not, at this point, going to give quarterly guidance. And what I think I'd say is we're at Tyson, not necessarily immune to the cattle cycle, but there are a couple of things I'd point out that maybe make this cycle a little bit different. Number one, we see the quality, generally speaking, around the industry is stronger and better that has kind of supported demand for beef cattle. I think secondly, the global demand is pretty strong. That's a little bit tempered by FX that we're seeing in our business. But generally speaking, I think that makes this cycle that we're heading into a slightly different. I'll let Shane maybe comment on some of the investments we're making around the business and give a little more detail as it relates to the outlook on Beef. Hey, there. You're kind of muffled on our end. I think your question was about CapEx and just wondering if we could expand upon that. Is that right?\nAntonio Herna\u0301ndez: Exactly. Yes. Sure thing. Well, I think, look, what we've talked to you about already this morning is our plans for a heavier investment in our business compared to historical years. And I think in a small part, that's driven a little bit about the inflationary environment that we're in. But really, I think the point we want you to take away is that we see a lot of opportunity in our business in terms of productivity improvements, things like automation and a little bit of capacity expansion. So, as it relates to priorities, I would tell you that in our value-added segments, we're trying to grow capacity and some of our chicken, prepared foods and fresh meats businesses, we see opportunities for network optimization. So, I don't think it's any departure from what you would expect us to be investing in, a decent balance of growth and productivity investments. I would emphasize, back to the question that someone asked earlier, automation is a huge part of our agenda. And what we like about those investments is we see sustained productivity as we reapportion team members to different parts of our operations. And so, we feel really confident in some of the more programmatic investments we're making around our automation agenda. Yes, Donnie, I think that was a fair summary. I mean, there's a balance in that projection between the volume growth and what we see from a sales growth from a pricing standpoint. And I think that we feel confident in the mix between those two things to achieve the range that we gave. You also asked a question about what's the capacity coming on line with the new build. And I think without going into details of each of those operations, a little bit of that is dependent on the timing of when things come online in '23. But I think overall, what we want you to take away is that we feel confident in the range at this standpoint as a roll-up of multiple factors that go into the numbers. No, nothing to add, Donnie. Thanks. Sure. I think, look, we've kind of tried to give some overall indications on volume as it relates to the various segments. And there's a lot of factors that go into the sales and AOI numbers we're looking at, part of which is volume. I think in our poultry business, we do feel comfortable about the sequential growth directionally speaking, that we're talking about as we head into FY23. And I think on the Beef business, even amidst the total environment and USDA calling out the harvest, I think what I'd point to is some of the investments we make in terms of our business model around our relationships with suppliers, investments in kind of the value-added parts of our business and continuing to grow in specific channels. I think we see it as critical to preserving the outlook for '23. Shane, maybe you have a little bit to add on the Beef segment. Hey Ken, this is John. Maybe let me answer that question first. And I think the first thing I'd point out, just as it relates to kind of the overall leadership team here, as you know, I've been on the executive team for going on a few years now and involved in the senior leadership level for more than that. So, I don't think from a capital allocation standpoint or a strategy standpoint, you should expect too many significant changes or departures from how things have been handled in the past. I guess that's the first point I'd make. Stewart and I are sitting here next to the -- stylistically, you might see a few differences between the two of us. But I think overall, I think the direction of the Company stays the same. I think check back with me in a quarter or two to see if there's any new ideas. But I think overall, I'll just provide the perspective that I think that these leadership moves are kind of both for continuity rather than radical change of any kind."

            "name": "Stewart Glendinning",
            "content": "I'd start by saying that it's great to run this business because when you look at the construct of the Prepared Foods business, on the retail side out of the 9 categories, we've got the number 1 position in 8 and on the foodservice side, we're in, I think, about 19 categories or so there. But -- and in the majority of those, we've got the number 1 position. So we're really starting from a position of strength just from a portfolio standpoint. You look at the way this year has gone, we took pricing earlier in the year. And so, as we went through the year, of course, we had continued inflation. So, looking to the back part of this -- of '23, as we go through '23, we're going to be recovering from the 5.8% to get up to the 8. And that's really going to have a couple of big drivers. The first one and the most important is volume. If you look back in the volume history, we shared last quarter that we'd lost some foodservice volume. We're working on getting that back. Our fill rates, we still have an opportunity in fill rates. And so there's volume that's actually sitting in our order queue that we can go and get and we're working on that and seeing improvement week over week. As the pricing, we'll see how the year goes. In this fourth quarter, we saw a strong volume performance. Some of that came on the back of increased promotions. But I'd note that our promotions were in line with our competition. So, back half of the year, probably the last point to make is we've got pretty strong plans for cost reduction this year, and that will also contribute to getting us to the 8% to 10%. Yes. Ken, maybe first just with the background point. I spent 13 years before this in the beer business, 10 of those as an executive officer, four of those as the CFO running in the branded businesses. So I'm coming to this business with a good knowledge of brands, and I'm excited to run what is a powerful part of our portfolio. When I look at the business, I see huge opportunity mainly because the platform is so strong. Starting off, if you look at the volume performance [Technical Difficulty] the last number of years, while share has been good, volume could be stronger. And so as I started to this job, I see real opportunity for volume improvement, particularly in the foodservice business and I'm pressing hard against that. That means filling the orders we already have and it means selling out the capacity that exists in our network. And both of those have a big -- have a big opportunity in our company. I also, by the way, look at our cost structures and believe that we've got the ability to run our business in a leaner way and still achieve the growth goals that we want to see in the company. And then, I'd probably finish up by saying that I further believe that on the innovation side, we have lots of runway and lots of opportunity to press hard in the market. So, I come into role with both, confidence and believing that we have a strong pathway ahead."

            "name": "Shane Miller",
            "content": "Thanks for the question, Adam. John touched on a couple of things that I think to think about that's a bit different this cycle versus previous cycles is one. John touched on the cattle quality, that's extremely different this go around than the last time we went through this cycle. The second component is globally beef has remained and still has been a strong demand product that's going into different channels throughout Asia. And also, we're seeing interest from different parts of the globe that historically have not been big buyers of U.S. beef. And then finally, if you think about the -- even though we do have a strong quality that's coming out of the meat products, but you have items such as our specialty products, fat and oils are off all items, items like that that typically haven't been large contributors that this go around are significant contributors. So, if you think of it in direction in relationship to the last cycle, I think we have an opportunity here to scale in here and do much better than the last go around. So I think all those things coupled together give us confidence and hope that we're going to continue to be able to drive this type of return. Yes. Peter, I think one of the things to keep in mind, too, when you look at beef is you're lapping a period a year ago with still a COVID-induced reduction in volumes. And we've seen our operations get back to -- we're getting 5 days of animals harvested, processed in 5 days and 6 days really turned into a flex day. So on top of that from the supply component, you're right. I mean, we are in the middle of the drought still, and we're seeing drought-induced movement into the feed yards continues to show lower weights at placement, which in a sense means that cattle are being pulled forward and so forth. So as you look forward here into the next several months, I mean we're still going to have plenty of animals to work through. Yes. Thanks for the question. Donnie, I think you hit on all the key points. The only thing I would mention is no matter what the market conditions are or the cattle supply, we feel good about all these investments to differentiate our beef business model. And on top of that, if you think about the investments that we've made and we are making into our supply chain on beef and cattle sustainability, these are key important topics that our customers and ultimately, the consumer are asking about. And we feel really good about what we're doing there, telling the story back up into the feed yard, but even further back into the ranch and to maintain and preserve resources and have focused on sustainability for the future."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thank you, Brandon, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we announced our fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2022 results. We showed record annual financial performance, including revenue, adjusted operating income and earnings per share. I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team members. Our results would not have been possible without them. In this challenging macroeconomic environment with historically high inflation, consumer demand for protein remains relatively steady. We remain well positioned to serve this demand. We leveraged our diverse protein portfolio across multiple channels and brands to meet customer and consumer needs across a broad range of products and price points, serving an estimated one-fifth of U.S. protein consumption. And as proven by our double-digit sales growth, our portfolio of value-added and branded products positions us uniquely to win. In addition to growing sales, we are also aggressively mitigating inflationary cost and SG&A expenses through a disciplined revenue management and enterprise-wide productivity actions, including investments in automation to improve operational excellence and efficiency. As we progress our efforts to be the most sought after place to work, we continue to listen to our team members' needs and invest in areas like childcare to provide a better quality of life for our team members. We're beginning to see results from these investments through improved staffing levels and reduced turnover. Before I discuss our financial performance, let me provide a bit of strategic context. As you are well aware, we have a strong and disciplined strategic growth plan. In this past year, we continue to methodically execute against this plan as we strengthened our position as a global protein leader. Our growth strategy is built on five key pillars: transforming our team member experience; growing with our customers to service demand; investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence; restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment; and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. I'm pleased to report that we have executed on each of these imperatives and delivered what we said we would, entering the fiscal year. Our commitment to strengthening our position as a global protein leader and driving value creation for our shareholders is the most important goal for our team. Having the right leadership team in place is also imperative as a global protein leader. To accomplish this, we recently announced changes in our executive leadership team, which we believe will drive improved results across our organization. Overall, we feel good about our performance. We saw a lot of really good things. We delivered record sales, revenue and earnings. The Chicken turnaround progressed as promised. Beef performed better than expected. And Prepared Foods is seeing positive volume momentum exiting the year. With that strategic context, let's turn to our financial performance. Compared to our initial fiscal year guidance, we exceeded our total company sales and Beef margin guidance. And we met guidance on Chicken and Prepared Foods margins. We managed our balance sheet and sit today at a leverage ratio comfortably below our guidance. Sales improved 7% for the fourth quarter and 13% year-over-year. We delivered record sales revenue as a company and across each of our four largest operating segments. We delivered record annual adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion, up 3% over the prior year. As expected, our fourth quarter earnings were lower compared to the prior year, but this was almost entirely due to record strength in Beef a year ago. Our operating income performance translated to adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 for the fourth quarter and a record $8.73 for the full year, up 5% from last year. Turning to our results on volume. We're continuing to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. We saw benefits of our efforts in the fourth quarter as total company volume increased 2.1%. We are building positive momentum and remain confident that our strategy will enable us to grow volumes across all segments long term. Chicken volumes increased 1.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year, driven by increased domestic production. In Prepared Foods, volumes were relatively flat in the quarter compared to the prior year. We are gaining momentum delivering sequential quarterly improvement, driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. The categories in which we play continue to be highly consumer-relevant with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre pandemic. In a few slides, we'll discuss our strong share performance. Compared to prior year, Beef volumes were up 5.1% for the quarter, driven by higher head throughput and carcass weight, improving from a full year volume deficit of 1.5% in the third quarter. We finished the year relatively flat. Pork volumes were down 1.1% for the quarter compared to prior year due to limited hog supply and reduced export demand. In International, volumes continue to grow, up 7.3% compared to the prior year quarter driven by our investments in capacity, innovation and brands that support market share growth. As we look ahead, one thing that excites me is the momentum I see in our branded retail business. It is evident that we are delivering the brands and the products that consumers want. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in growth up 18% in volume sales in the last 13 weeks compared to pre-pandemic levels per Nielsen data. According to Nielsen data, Tyson core business lines grew volume share by 2.6 points this quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels, while also growing share relative to a year ago. We continue to be the market share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete while also gaining share in 7 of these 9 core categories. We experienced the greatest share gains in frozen protein breakfast, smoked sausage and corn dog category. Our brand strength relative to our peers is undeniable as Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete. Many of our retail businesses continue to outperform total food and beverage and remain highly relevant to consumers and therefore, elevated in consumption. Consumers will continue to spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. This data shows the recovery we're seeing versus a year ago and the momentum we are gaining as we move into fiscal 2023. We have made steady progress improving fill rates and on-shelf availability as we focus on serving our current customers and attracting new customers to grow our distribution and volume. Additionally, we took various degrees of pricing in our key categories earlier this fiscal year to offset inflationary cost pressures. Recently, we have seen competitors followed by increasing their prices nearing Tyson's price gap relative to our competitors. This is supporting improved volume performance across our portfolio of prepared foods products as we are continuing to see price elasticities remain below historical levels. We're investing strategically in merchandising and advertising to support the long-term health of our brands as their strength enables continued growth in both, dollar and volume retail share. These factors, along with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in many of our key retail category and we expect our retail share growth to continue. While the foodservice industry has yet to recover to pre-pandemic traffic levels, the Tyson Focus 6 group is outpacing both total broadline and respective categories and volume sales, up 18.9% and 0.9 share points in the last 52 weeks compared to last year according to NPD supply track data. The Tyson Focus 6 group composed of value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon and Philly Steak is also up 1.7 volume share points in the last 52 weeks compared to pre-pandemic levels. We believe strongly in our foodservice portfolio and are confident there is immediate and long-term growth ahead of this business as we align with key growing customers and execute our strategy across all categories to build momentum for the future. Our team members are essential to providing the products to our customers and consumers demand. Staffing levels and the impact on operational throughput were a challenge in our business. We continue to make significant investments in our team members' experience, prioritizing these three key areas of health, safety and well-being of our team members, total rewards and team member growth and our One Tyson culture with digitalization as a key enabler. We're now seeing business results from investing in becoming the most sought after place to work. Examples of these investments are free education, child care solutions, citizenship support, transportation, maternity and paternity leave and expanded mental health and well-being benefits. In August, we received national recognition for our innovative ridesharing program benefiting team members across the nation. The program provides an option for team members who may have difficulty assessing reliable transportation to get to work and is improving their quality of life. Investments in enhanced benefits, digitalized processes and tools and career growth opportunities for our team members are paying off. In October, we announced our One Tyson corporate office consolidation to world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. The move will enable excellence and execution by bringing our corporate business unit roles together on one campus, driving a culture that optimizes collaboration, innovation, accelerate speed and facilitates career growth for our team members. The feedback we've received from our customers for this change has been well received. These investments we're making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from an environmental, social and governance perspective. Today, we are focused on 3 core pillars of our ESG framework, the formula to feed the future. Those 3 pillars are reimagining people and community impact, driving product responsibility from farm to table and working toward achieving net zero. In July, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition to become the world's most sustainable and transparent protein company. In addition to the investments in people mentioned, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, minimizing waste, water stewardship and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce emissions. Significant progress was achieved in the past fiscal year in improving our scores and metrics within ESG rating agencies. We are particularly proud of a more than 30% increase in our Dow Jones Sustainability Index score year-over-year, and we're taking more steps to continue to improve our standing with ESG stakeholders. In the past fiscal year, our productivity program outperformed on our commitments, delivering over $700 million in savings impact across all components of our business. This performance indicates how Tyson has remained focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing our supply chain and increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations. We expect the productivity program will continue to outperform our original expectations of more than $1 billion in recurring savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. The program is now on track to deliver this commitment by the end of fiscal year 2023, a year earlier than expected. As mentioned before, these recurring savings support the partial offset of inflationary pressures while at the same time, improving our competitiveness in the marketplace. Automation remains a top priority, and I'm very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation technologies across all segments in fiscal year 2022, including continuing to scale debone automation in our poultry operations and pack-out automation across all businesses. I will now turn the call over to John to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the fourth quarter. Thanks, John. I would like to take a moment to make one final point. Like John, the Company takes this matter seriously. Tyson Foods has a strong, robust corporate governance process. Our independent Board of Directors are overseeing a thorough review of this matter, and I'm confident in this independent process. With this said, and before I turn the call back over to Brandon for your questions, I'd like to remind you that 2022 was a record year for sales for operating income as well as EPS, and we look forward to a strong 2023. Thanks, Adam. This is Donnie. Thanks for the question. The Chicken turnaround continues. We've made a lot of progress. David and his team have got our chicken business in a better place than it's been in some time. But we haven't arrived yet. There's still things to do. And we get better sequentially each quarter and would expect that to continue. I would point out that we're guiding to a 6% to 8% for '23, and we feel very good about that. And we feel good about investing in our Tyson brand and continuing to use that. But let me just flip it over to David. And this is a guy who's been doing all the work, and he and his team -- and let him add some additional color for you. Let me just say that -- and I'll pass it over to Stewart to add some commentary. We guided to 8% to 10% in 2023. And behind productivity, capacity utilization and mix improvements, we anticipate improved volume sales and AOI for '23. Our foodservice recovery is a little slower pace than expected, but we feel very good about this segment and the performance. And I'm personally very proud that we have Stewart leading this business. And Stewart, why don't you add some comments? Sure. Thanks for the question. So, the productivity program, as we laid it out, it was a 3-year program, and we're well ahead of that in 2022. And we talked about this in terms of really 3 buckets. Automation is obviously one of those, digital is another, and then operational and functional excellence. And all of those are working together really, really well. We think we'll meet our commitment by the end of this fiscal year '23. But it seems like every rock we turn over, we find something new and we capture that, and we'll continue to do that. The automation piece specifically is progressing faster than what we had planned. And of course, we're happy about that. But -- and remember, the automation piece was to eliminate some laborious difficult, high turnover type of positions. And in the program, as I think it was in the script that I mentioned in chicken, the debone automation project. But we also, in this programmatic approach to automation, where we have focused in our pack-out area. And we've also launched our digital enablement group as we take technology throughout Tyson. And we're progressing on all of those, and we'll update you each and every quarter on how we're doing in that area. I have nothing to report on that now. We obviously are eliminating positions and are eliminating difficult jobs, and we are reassigning people to open position throughout the company. Thank you. In short, we have a plan. Let's start with the office consolidation that you referenced. This is something that we've talked about. We've looked at for a number of years now. And we made the decision to do that in an effort to be a better version of ourselves. We're still working through trying to finalize which team members are moving and which ones are not. We certainly realize it's a difficult decision for those team members, and we're committed to providing the resources and the way we've characterized that here at Tyson is we're trying to help those team members, and it's about 1,100 of them, to be able to find the yes in terms of being able to move here and with their families. And I would just characterize it as integration a few years later. And there's opportunity obviously that we see in terms of being better, being more agile and delivering better results, being more productive, all those type attributes. And in order to get that, we had to do our project concept. Now, in terms of the people, I would remind you, at Tyson, we have a -- our succession planning process is very robust. And we're working that program. It's a living document, and we did, to your point, make some decisions. I would start with I am very pleased with the decisions that we've made around John Randal, around Stewart and Amy Tu. These are very talented individuals and all of them have experience in other areas that -- and then they brought that to Tyson. So, we're comfortable with the team that we've got. The team feels good with the leaders that they have. And I already see great progress in the work that they're doing. And -- but we're -- I'm perfectly comfortable with the people we put in place. Sure. So I think the thing that you need to know about that is we've been working and meeting almost on a daily basis. We put together a team to execute the plan that we have in place. We've invited every team member to join us here in Northwest Arkansas. And that's open. We've asked them to commit to us what their intentions are. And in fact, today, I don't know the numbers yet, but today was the day at which we needed to know that. And we really approached this in a couple of different ways. One is we want you to be here. We want you to remain a part of Tyson Foods. And quite frankly, I've been out recruiting people to, as other leaders have, to come to Northwest Arkansas. And we've had a lot of success. There will be some people who, at this point in their life, can't move. And so, we will try to create an opportunity where they can stay with the company long enough so that their replacement could be hired and trained so that we have no business interruption or interruption of business continuity. Let me start off, Ken, and say this. I mean, we feel very confident in the -- what we've laid out in terms of outlook. Could we move to the higher side? Perhaps. But we're guiding to have a really, really good year. We factored in things like inflation. We factored in growing share in both dollar and volume. We've included all those things in terms of the drought and the conditions that we're seeing in the Beef segment, the strength of the dollar from an export position. So, in short, I would tell you that we've considered all those things in coming up with this plan. And we rolled it up as a team, and we all signed off on it. But I'll pass it to John and see if he wants to... So, great question. First thing I would say to you is we had a good '22, and we feel very good about delivering a year early in '23. Our nature is that we are -- have a continuous improvement mindset. So, we will identify and continue to identify opportunities to become more productive, become more efficient to run lines at rate better to automate, do all those type of things that will continue to bring money to the bottom line. We feel good about that, and I think you could expect that we would have another program or continuation of this program. I don't know what that is at this moment. John, anything? Let me -- I'll mention a few things, and then I'll let David add some additional color. Yes, we feel very good about that. I would remind you that in our portfolio, the percentage of our portfolio that is value-added is significant. And a significant portion of that is branded. And so we have a lot more discretion with that. Some of the pricing variability is essentially more associated with some of the segments like fresh chicken or things like that. But we feel very good. And if you go back and look at us through history, you will find when the market goes up really high in breast meat -- and I think a quarter or so ago, breast meat was trading at around $2.60 and you can buy that for about $0.90 today. You know what, we never got the high of that based on our model, and we never get the lows either. So, we trade within a range here, and we have, on purpose and have more -- or better, more predictable results. David? If I might, Ken, just a couple of things. Stewart touched in fairly great detail his prior experience, and he does have great experience coming into Tyson. But John Randal, he's had experience outside of Tyson. He's had escalating levels of responsibility and banking and venture capitalism prior to joining Tyson. But you may not know that within Tyson for the last four years, he's led the M&A strategy, ventures and other areas of the Company. So -- but don't forget about the fact that he's been involved in this business essentially his whole life. So, a lot of experience there. Let me mention Amy Tu, which you didn't ask about very specifically. But Amy came to us with a great deal of global leadership outside of Tyson with Boeing and Walmart. She has strong experience in M&A, strategy and commercial as well as the legal background. And she's a very talented person. And I'm very happy with what I'm seeing out of all three of these today, and I think they will make us a better Tyson as we move forward. Let me -- Ken, thank you. Let me just say a couple of things. We think we have a bit of a different business model than we had, let's say, in 2015, when we went through the drought last time. It's already been talked about today in terms of our relationship with these producers that provide us with this better quality grading animals that we have. I think it's also important to remind you about the global demand is better than previous cycles. People outside the United States are looking for high-quality, grain-fed U.S. beef. And so, we're able to meet that. But we've also invested heavily to be able to take boxed beef up the value chain with our investment most recently in Eagle Mountain, Utah and also in Columbia, South Carolina. So, we continue to take beef and pork up the value chain. And so we feel better. We feel -- the drought is real. We see that. We're not kidding ourselves about that, but we intend to manage through it and perform better than we did the last time through. Shane? We have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins, channels and geographies. We are improving operational efficiencies and have a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. For these reasons, we are confident we will grow revenue and maintain strong profitability in fiscal year 2023 and have future long-term growth ahead of us. At Tyson, we're focused on making food affordable, accessible and nutritious for customers and consumers around the world. Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking again soon."

            "content": "Perfect, Donnie. Thank you very much. And you said it very well. We have made progress in 2022, but we've got a considerable amount of work to do as we get into 2023. But it's also important to understand that our goals have not changed within this segment, and we are aligned on not only making sure that we service our customers, but we run our facilities and capacity. And that's incredibly important to us as we move into 2023. As a team, we're focused on making sure that our customers are serviced, that we fill our plants and that we're taking care of our team members. And in total, we've got a very strong plan for 2023. And John mentioned the guidance between 6% to 8%, and we feel very good about the plan we have in place to deliver those numbers. We are well on track. We are very pleased with the work that our live team has done in getting this put back in a position where we're no longer having daily conversations about what our hatch rates are. So, we are on track and feel good. Donnie, I think that was perfect, especially when you talk about our exposure and the amount of big bird breast meat that we actually have a part of. But the other piece to that is we have great customers Tyson Foods. And what we've done within our variable pricing is provided us the opportunity to have more consistent conversations with them about the things that make their prices go up and the things that make their prices go down. And we'll continue to have those conversations despite soft times and seasonality. So, a lot of progress has been made against that. And again, we've done a lot of work to shift into more of a value-added mix."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Brandon Tucker, Senior Manager. Sir, please go ahead.\nBrandon Tucker: Hello, and welcome to the third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call for Tyson Foods.

For reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release. I will now turn the call over to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thank you, Brandon, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we reported solid third quarter and year-to-date results. We continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic operating environment, and I\u2019m grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team members. Our results would not have been possible without them. At our Investor Day last year, we shared three priorities with you: winning with team members, winning with customers and consumers, and winning with execution. And I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019re making progress. For team members, our continuing investments are reducing turnover and improving staffing levels. For customers, our service levels are improving. Our execution, we\u2019re getting stronger, driving substantial savings and improving business results. I\u2019m confident we\u2019re on the right track and recognize that there is more work to do. Let me cover some highlights from the quarter. Our multi-protein portfolio enabled our business results. In the third quarter versus last year, we delivered substantially improved earnings in our Chicken segment as well as higher earnings in Prepared Foods, which partially offset a decline in Beef and Pork earnings and we continue to accelerate our productivity actions to improve efficiency across all segments. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage, up 13% in the last 13 weeks compared to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to be the market share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete. While gaining share in both bacon and breakfast sausage in 6 of the 9 core business lines, we grew share versus our second quarter. I was also pleased to see continued growth in our e-commerce channel, where approximately 1 in 5 U.S. households bought a Tyson product during the past quarter with e-commerce sales growing 15% versus last year. We\u2019re seeing some recovery in the foodservice channel with continued gains in quarterly sales. In broadline distribution, we have seen specific strength in branded value-added chicken, breakfast sausage and bacon. In this challenging economic environment, where our cost of goods has continued to increase, consumer demand for protein remains relatively steady. Our diverse portfolio allows us to meet customer and consumer needs across a broad range of products and price points even as consumers shift between proteins and products. Our balance sheet grew stronger, providing optionality to invest in growth across our portfolio and return cash to shareholders. We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on total shareholder return. Our year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports. Our growth objectives are growing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders. Now for highlights from our financial performance. Sales improved 8% for the third quarter and 16% year-to-date compared to the prior period. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price in Chicken and Prepared Foods. Average sales price increased in these segments in response to persistent increase in the cost of goods. Prices were lower in Beef, in line with expectations and Pork segment versus the same quarter last year. We delivered solid operating income of nearly $1 billion because of our diversified portfolio. Year-to-date, we are up 15% over prior year. As expected, year-over-year third quarter earnings were lower as Beef margins declined relative to a year ago, but still performed well in comparison to historical results. Overall, earnings per share came in at $1.94 for the third quarter and $7.10 year-to-date. We remain confident our actions will improve our long-term volume performance. However, our total volume was down both for the quarter and year-to-date. We are focused on overcoming the supply chain challenges, running our plants full and reducing our costs. Chicken volume is up year-to-date, driven by demand and operational improvements, but down for the quarter. Lower quarterly volumes were driven by the fiscal year \u201821 fire at our rendering plant in Hanceville, Alabama as well as lower outside purchases of meat, chicks and eggs. This was partially offset by increased levels of internal harvest versus the same quarter last year, and we expect internal growth to continue as we ramp up our bird supply. For the full year, we expect Chicken to deliver 1% to 2% volume growth. In Prepared Foods, volumes are down 5.5% year-to-date due to supply chain challenges, uneven food service recovery and the impact of increased pricing. Note also that the divestiture of our pet treats business last year drives 1.2% of the total decline. Although retail volume is down, we maintained our market leadership positions. While the foodservice channel continues to recover, volume growth remains strong in the broadline distribution led by breakfast sausage and bacon. In Beef, volumes were down year-to-date but were up 1.3% versus the same quarter last year, and we continued to increase quarter-over-quarter due to higher head throughput and carcass weight. In Pork, volumes were down year-to-date by 2.1% because of limited hog supply and lower export demand. We expect tightness in live hog inventories and declining export demand to continue to impact volumes in the fourth quarter. In the International/Other segment, volumes are up 11.7% year-to-date and 21.9% versus the same quarter last year. Investments in capacity, innovation and brands are supporting our market share growth. Volume growth was driven by our strengthening QSR and retail performance. Overall, our International business is growing both organically and inorganically. During Q4, we signed a joint venture agreement with Tanmiah Food Company in Saudi Arabia. This partnership will enable us to better serve our large global customers as well as expand our reach to new customers in the Middle East. We\u2019re investing in new plants and expanding existing capacity across our global network. 8 plants are being constructed, with 2 expected to begin operation this fiscal year and 6 more by the end of fiscal year \u201823. This additional capacity will enable our team to address capacity constraints accelerate our value-added growth and better serve growing consumer demand for protein. We continue to make significant investments to attract and retain team members, including childcare, citizenship support, transportation, free technical and college education, on-site health clinics, maternity and paternity leave and other health benefits. Our nearside health centers in rural communities are seeing increased usage. These clinics provide team members, spouses and dependents, comprehensive health care services at little to no cost. Investment in team members are making an impact as higher pay and enhanced benefit offerings have led to lower turnover and absenteeism in our plants, which positions Tyson for future growth. We are committed to creating a differentiated work experience for our team members. These investments we\u2019re making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from an ESG standpoint. Over the past several years, we have made many investments to these ends. Today, we are focused on three core pillars of our ESG framework, the formula to feed the future. Those 3 pillars are reimagine people and community impact, drive product responsibility from farm to table, and working toward achieving net zero. Earlier this quarter, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition and commitments to become the world\u2019s most sustainable and transparent protein company. In addition to the investments in people I mentioned a few moments ago, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, minimizing waste, water stewardship and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce emissions. We\u2019re setting aggressive ESG goals and working to meet them. As we run our business better, we are making process improvements, digitalizing the supply chain, increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations. Our productivity program continues to deliver at the upper range of our initial projections and we\u2019ll realize more than $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. We\u2019re continuing to accelerate digitalization across Tyson through supply chain planning and executional processes to better serve our customer. Automation remains a top priority for our business, and I\u2019m very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation technologies. And given the macroeconomic environment, we are taking action to cut cost, reduce spend and reassess every role across the business to ensure that the work we do is value added for our customers and consumers. Finally, as we look for new and innovative ideas that can have the greatest impact on Tyson\u2019s productivity and sustainability objectives, we held the first-ever Tyson Demo Day. More than 100 companies were considered as presenters for the Demo Day, 20 were selected to make their pitch and ultimately, 6 companies were chosen for partnership. We are committed to strengthening our position as a global protein leader, and driving value creation for our shareholders. At our Investor Day, we outlined 5 imperatives for strengthening our position as a global protein leader. I\u2019ve spoken about transforming our team member experience, increasing capacity, investing in digital and automation and the strength of our balance sheet. Chicken remains a key focus for our long-term success, and we are executing against our road map to restore top quartile performance for this segment. This quarter, we surpassed a 6% adjusted operating margin. We expect to reach 40 million head per week by the end of this fiscal year, and to continue to grow after that, enabling us to maximize our fixed cost leverage and grow our value-added business. We are optimizing our plant network by adding fully cooked capacity, converting plants for value-added production, implementing plant flexibility and optimizing our portfolio mix. We have come a long way and have more work to do, but I\u2019m pleased with the progress that we are making in Chicken. As we look to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we\u2019re using our financial strength to invest in our business. We will have invested nearly $1.9 billion in fiscal year \u201822 focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives. Year-to-date, we returned to shareholders approximately $1.2 billion in dividends and share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return. I will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the third quarter.\nStewart Glendinning: Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We\u2019re pleased to report solid results in the third quarter and year-to-date. Sales were up for both, the third quarter and year-to-date, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in cost of goods. Volumes were down both for the third quarter and year-to-date due to supply constraints and a challenging macroeconomic environment impacting consumer demand. Looking at our sales results by channel. Retail drove $173 million of top line improvement in the third quarter relative to the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, the ongoing recovery in the foodservice channel drove an increase of $165 million. Sales to international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products, were $339 million greater than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. Donnie covered our earnings and EPS results. Slide 11 bridges operating income for the third quarter, which was $374 million lower than fiscal 2021. Volumes were down 1.9% in the quarter. Our pricing actions, which partially offset the higher input costs, led to higher sales during the quarter. We saw continued increases in cost of goods across the business, in some instances, up to 15%. Notable examples were labor, feed ingredients, live animals and freight costs. SG&A was $20 million unfavorable to the same period last year due to increased investment in advertising and promotional spend and technology-related costs, partially offset by lower commission costs incurred by selling direct to customers rather than via brokers. As Donnie said, we are assessing all of our SG&A expenses across the business to identify non-value-added spend. Savings from our productivity program initiatives continue to have a positive impact on margins. Moving to the Beef segment. Sales were approximately $5 billion for the third quarter, flat versus the same period last year, but up 15% year-to-date at nearly $15 billion. Sales in the quarter remained strong, supported by higher volume but offset by lower average sales price driven by softer consumer demand for premium cuts of beef. Global consumer demand for beef products remains strong, and we expect volume to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as improved labor participation supports higher plant productivity. On expenses, we incurred greater costs during the third quarter versus the comparable prior year period as live cattle costs increased approximately $480 million in the quarter. We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by higher herd liquidation due to drought conditions. We delivered segment operating income of $506 million in the quarter, down 55% versus the prior year comparable period. Our operating margin of 10.2% was lower than the same quarter last year but remains a strong performance. We expect to see Beef margins return closer to an expected long-term 5% to 7% average. Looking next to the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 6% versus the same period last year, but up 4% year-to-date at $4.8 billion. Global demand is being impacted domestically by high retail prices and internationally by the strong dollar, making U.S. pork relatively expensive as compared to alternative sources globally. For the quarter, the average sales price decreased 3.9%. Segment operating income was $25 million and $248 million for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. While down 63% versus the comparable prior year quarter, operating income is down less than 1% year-to-date. Overall operating margins for the segment declined to 1.5% for the quarter. The operating income deterioration was driven by compressed pork margins with rising hog costs and a constrained cutout. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 5% relative to the same period last year and up 9% year-to-date at $7.2 billion. Sales increased despite a volume decline driven by higher average sales prices. Note, part of the volume decline in the quarter was driven by the sale of our pet treats business. Our brand strength and category relevance has enabled continued strong performance across multiple categories. Operating margin for the segment was 7.6% or $186 million for the quarter, up versus last year. Year-to-date, operating margin is 8.9% and flat compared to the prior year at $635 million. Cost of goods continues to increase, pressuring our cost of production. To offset higher costs, we\u2019ve executed productivity initiatives, revenue management and optimize our spend. To support our growth aspirations, we continue to invest in marketing and trade to increase the market share of our brands. Moving into the Chicken segment\u2019s results. Sales were $4.4 billion for the quarter, up 26%. Year-to-date, sales are up 25% at $12.3 billion. Average sales price increased in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures has reduced risk by allowing us to be more agile in response to increasing cost of goods. Chicken delivered adjusted operating income of $269 million in the third quarter representing an operating margin of 6.2%. Quarterly operating income increased over the same quarter last year due to higher average sales price and efficiency improvements, partially offset by increased cost of goods. For the third quarter, we experienced $145 million in higher feed ingredient costs versus prior year, and we recognized $23 million in net derivative losses compared to $56 million of net derivative gains in the prior year. Turning to slide 16. Our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support our disciplined capital allocation approach. We remain focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members and business and returning cash to shareholders. We produced $1.9 billion of operating cash flow so far during fiscal year \u201822, and that\u2019s after funding a $1.9 billion increase in our working capital. Our leverage ratio at 1.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA demonstrates our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity, market capabilities and profitability. This will support return on capital generation above the market for our shareholders. Finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve returned $491 million in dividends and repurchased $693 million of shares, including $170 million of shares during the third quarter. Let\u2019s now discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on the strong results year-to-date, we\u2019re maintaining our total company sales guidance at a range of $52 billion to $54 billion. We now expect total volume growth to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Looking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments. In Chicken, our operational turnaround is on track, and we expect full year margins to be between 5% and 7%, but at the lower end. Based on the current trends in retail and foodservice, we expect the full year margin in Prepared Foods to be at the lower end of the 8% to 10% range. In Beef, we expect margins to move toward our expected 5% to 7% range as the live cattle to cutout price spread continues to decline. However, we still expect to deliver a full year AOI margin of 11% to 13%. In Pork, due to margin compression from hog costs and global demand headwinds, we\u2019re reducing our full year AOI margin outlook to be in the range of 3% to 5%. In International/Other, we anticipate slightly lower results from our foreign operations in fiscal \u201822 due to supply chain disruptions and other impacts related to COVID-19. Our expectations for CapEx and net interest expense are lowered to $1.9 billion and $350 million, respectively. Our tax rate expectation is lowered from approximately 23% to approximately 22.5%. Our net leverage is expected to remain well below 2 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders for the remainder of the year. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Brandon for Q&A instructions. Brandon?\nBrandon Tucker: Thanks, Stewart. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays.\nBen Theurer: Yes. The first one I wanted to kind of understand a little bit your commentary around the Chicken segment and obviously, the -- on one side, improvements you have within your operations, but then at the same time, there seems to be a few headwinds arising on the industry side. So, help us frame a little bit into the final quarter, but also maybe bridging into next year, how you think about the Chicken segment? And what\u2019s your competitive advantage on the pricing side and how you think your investments into labor, better hedgeability as well as better pricing is going to basically bring you to that 5% to 7% range, which you\u2019re almost there already on a year-to-date basis, but how should we think about next year? Thank you.\nDonnie King: Thank you, Ben, for that question. The turnaround that we\u2019ve talked about for the last year now continues. And I\u2019m pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made and said that in the script. We still have work to do, grain and the volatility around grain, supply, demand, so forth, still exists out there. But the demand for chicken is extremely strong. Demand for ready-to-eat chicken, for example, is very strong. And we\u2019re at capacity as it relates to that. We are investing and have a new asset coming on line early next year, and that will obviously be a help. But the business did grow. And there\u2019s a lot of noise in this particular quarter around the Hanceville fire in Q4 of \u201821 that we\u2019ll work through. But the thing I want you to hear is that our harvest rates continue to improve, and there will be over -- there\u2019ll be $40 million or so in Q4, and it will continue to grow from there. But I want to stop and pause at that point, and I\u2019m going to pass it to David Bray, and David, if you\u2019d like to add some more color.\nDavid Bray: Yes. Good morning, Ben, and just a little bit of additional color to that. And I think it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re doing what we said we would do in chicken. And we are progressing, but we are far from finished. And we know where our opportunities exist. And a large part of that will be uncovered as we can see that our volume grow through the Q4 time frame. The ability for us to process more head through our facilities will help us from a cost standpoint, which will benefit us as we continue to progress through FY \u201824 -- \u201823. And as Donnie stated, we are seeing share gains. Our harvest is up and we will continue to grow share through the Q4 time frame and into FY \u201823 as well.\nBen Theurer: And then just as only -- just a very technical question maybe for Stewart. So, as we are on a year-to-date basis, still down on the volume on a consolidated basis, is the flat guidance really a function of because of 4Q Prepared Foods, you get the easier comp because the divestiture happened last year during 4Q and that\u2019s where the volume impact was? Is that the right way how we should think about it?\nStewart Glendinning: Well, I would just say, Ben, I mean, there\u2019s probably a few more moving parts than that. Of course, you\u2019re looking at all parts of the business to get to flat. But of course, you\u2019re right. I mean, the divestiture is one of those things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: So first question is around the Prepared Foods elasticity. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about which categories were particularly affected this time and whether you expect those kind of trends to continue. I\u2019m wondering where the competitive pricing dynamics are causing some pressure there. Let\u2019s start there.\nDonnie King: Okay. I\u2019ll start, and then I will flip it over to Noelle to add some details. But I would start with that we are seeing some movements in the marketplace between foodservice to retail. In-home dining continues to increase in this environment, which we would -- suspected. We\u2019re also seeing some movement from quick service chain account type business to more in -- on-premise dining as COVID wanes and the people are more adventurous that they get out. And so we\u2019re seeing some improvement in that as well. But I would tell you, overall, we are starting to see some elasticity, but I would tell you they\u2019re below what historical elasticity you would expect. Noelle, anything you\u2019d like to add to that?\nNoelle O\u2019Mara: Sure. Thanks for the question, Alexia. As I look at our prepared performance holistically, top line remains strong behind disciplined revenue management actions and profit is above prior year\u2019s. Pricing and productivity are partially offset by the cost of good increases. And as referenced, our prepared volumes on an organic basis are down about 5.5% year-to-date. And it\u2019s really three key focus areas. The first is supply. We continue to not be able to fill all of the orders that we have across our portfolio. And as capacity continues to come on line and as we improve our supply capabilities, it will allow us to not only improve availability but also merchandising that\u2019s been suppressed. And so, you\u2019ll see as those improvements continue to take shape in Q4, us investing back in merchandising. The second area is really around pricing. And as Donnie referenced -- well, elasticity are better than historical lows, they still are impacting the business. And given the macroeconomic environment, we\u2019re ensuring that we provide a breadth of value offerings across our portfolio, and you\u2019ll see us launching items focused on opium price points as well as larger sizes that can provide consumers value. And then, the third area is really foodservice recovery. And we\u2019re focused on not only getting back volume that we lost during the pandemic, but also driving portfolio offerings in many solutions that align to the operator and consumer needs. So, what I feel good about is we have categories that continue to outpace total food and beverage. We have a portfolio of leading brands and a focus on continuing to innovate and meet our consumer and customer needs in an obviously a very dynamic environment. And despite the continued market challenges, I\u2019m expecting volume growth in the coming quarter is driven by the improved supply, the commercial investments in merchandising and innovation and continued food service recovery.\nAlexia Howard: A quick follow-up. Sticking with that part of the business. Private label dynamics, it seems as though need is being particularly affected by private label. I know you make private label presumably, it may be lower margin for you. Just wondering what you\u2019re seeing in that area as that much occurs?\nNoelle O\u2019Mara: As we look at private label performance, we don\u2019t see any acceleration as we look at the past couple of periods. Where we do see share pressure in our portfolio, we also see the availability of merchandising lagging versus prior year. So, that\u2019s why going back to our focus is on supply, our focus is on driving that volume so we can get back to the availability levels as well as the merchandising performance in the quarters ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: I had two on beef and cattle. First is do you have any additional color on when you expect maybe the turn in the cycle, right, from the point of, we\u2019re still in the liquidation phase to maybe that ending and heading toward a little bit more of a shortage than what\u2019s ideal for you? Any more insights into how we should think about modeling that from a timing perspective?\nDonnie King: We still are maintaining our guidance for the segment to 11% to 13% for the full year. I think our number was 10.2%. The cost increases we\u2019re seeing on cattle are certainly impacting the spread. And we\u2019ve been talking now for a number of periods about the fact that there were going to be fewer cattle. I think we\u2019re current now from the cattle that we\u2019re involved in the backlog of COVID. We\u2019re current on that. The prices of those animals have continued to increase. And so, there\u2019s drought and all those kind of conversations. But let me flip it over to Shane, and I\u2019ll let him give you some color around beef.\nShane Miller: Yes. Ken, good morning and thanks for the question. Yes. So, to Donnie\u2019s point earlier, we, as an industry, have moved through the backlog of the COVID impact and the harvest disruptions from COVID. We are still experiencing drought, and I\u2019d say the drought impact is still impacting over 40% of the regions where we grow cattle out in this country. So, the drought is real, and it\u2019s still having an impact today. I think getting precise and specific on the timing of when it\u2019s going to flip is awfully difficult to do because we\u2019re dealing with mother nature right now. But I would say, if you look at beef demand in general, we continue to see real robust demand, not just in the United States, but globally. So, we feel real good from a demand perspective. The quality of beef that we\u2019re still bringing to the marketplace is historically strong. Grading continues to maintain a high level. So, from a demand perspective and a quality perspective, we feel real good about this. But as to getting precise on the timing of when that\u2019s going to flip, I think that\u2019s awfully difficult to do.\nKen Goldman: Well, if you don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think anyone knows. But I have a quick follow-up. On the -- in the prepared remarks -- and thank you so much for these, you did provide a little bit more color on the ranges that you expect for the Chicken segment margin and the Prepared Foods margin. It still is a little bit of a wide range in beef. Maybe you purposely left it that way because there\u2019s so much uncertainty. But maybe directionally, you could send us sort of how to think about that margin for the year, now that you\u2019re -- the year is getting closer to done in that particular segment would be helpful, if you can.\nDonnie King: Yes. I\u2019ll just reiterate what I said before, Ken, is, for the full year, 11% to 13%, we\u2019ll see this move to, let\u2019s call it, 6% to 8% as we\u2019re in Q4, the latter part of Q4. And then over time, let\u2019s talk \u201823, we\u2019ve been saying for a couple of quarters now that we see that being a 5% to 7%, which is lower than where we\u2019ve been over the last couple of years, but versus the historical level, what we would be seeing there is very much in line with what we\u2019ve built into our modeling and what we would anticipate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: I guess, my first question, and maybe going back to Prepared Foods, and Stewart, I think I heard you say, at the low end of the 8% to 10% range for the full fiscal year, which I guess for the fourth quarter would get you something below 8%. And I guess, I\u2019m trying to just make sure I understand some of the key moving pieces around the margins there. I would have thought you were in a better place on the price/cost side by now given some of the pricing actions in the marketplace. And I guess, the corollary to that is when thinking about the foodservice parts of this business, many of which -- or the legacy Tyson came from the AdvancePierre acquisition. Can you talk about kind of how those have been performing at this juncture? It would seem like the retail brands on Nielsen remain quite healthy and those have, I would think, good better margins than the segment average. And so, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how the foodservice pieces are performing margin wise and if there\u2019s something that may be more and more significant needs to happen to that part of the business.\nStewart Glendinning: Well, I\u2019ll just pick up the margin point quickly, and then Noelle can expand on some of the other pieces. But just look from a margin perspective, as I said, we are going to come in at the low end of the range. That gives you a little bit of flex. Certainly, that means that we would just mathematically would be in the high 7s or low 8 for Q4.\nNoelle O\u2019Mara: Just to build on Stewart\u2019s comment. So, when you look at industry forecasts, we do show a slowdown in \u201822. However, the industry is still expected to rebound by 2025. And this unevenness of recovery\u2019s due to two things, the macroeconomic landscape as well as mix shifting between channels. So, we see that, as Donnie referenced, with improved consumer mobility and comfort eating out, we see an increase in on-premise dining and a slowdown in some of the quick service restaurants that had originally led through the recovery. We\u2019ve specifically seen some slowdown in our tortillas and pepperoni business that index against our commercial chain accounts. And we gave up some of the volume through the pandemic because of the spike in the demand. And so, we\u2019re not only focused on getting back volume, but also, as I referenced, innovating and partnering with customers to ensure that we\u2019re leading through the overall recovery.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. All right. And then, maybe another question for Stewart. If I look at the balance sheet trends in the quarter, net debt to EBITDA, you bought back a little bit of stock in the fiscal third quarter. But I guess, just looking forward into the next -- over the next 12 to 24 months, I mean I\u2019m just -- the balance sheet is kind of comfortable with your leverage target. You\u2019re already investing quite aggressively on the organic CapEx side. And so, I guess, I\u2019m just trying to make sense of kind of the comfort level you have with the balance sheet kind of where it is versus what it would take to a significant releveraging event, but maybe a bigger step-up in share repurchase that there isn\u2019t continued excess cash building on the balance sheet from here. So any added color that you could provide just in priority of share repurchase moving forward?\nStewart Glendinning: Sure, of course. Well, look, first, I mean, we\u2019re very pleased with the strength of our balance sheet. When you look at our leverage levels, we haven\u2019t seen leverage levels like these since 2011, that sort of time frame. So, we\u2019re pleased with having come through COVID and put ourselves in a place where we\u2019ve got a rock-solid balance sheet. With respect to the capital allocation, our capital allocation approach, we\u2019ve got a very good balanced approach. And that is strengthening our balance sheet, which we\u2019ve done investing in our business, which you pointed out. We have ramped up our spend on CapEx, and that is good spend because it\u2019s coming in at strong returns. And it\u2019s helping to grow our business. And then, of course, your question really about why don\u2019t we go to the share buyback, I mean, last year, this time, we spent about $50 million on buybacks. This year, we\u2019ve got almost $700 million. And part of that is catching up on the dilution that we had from last year. So, we\u2019ll see how that goes, but we\u2019re very pleased with where we are from a balance sheet standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to revisit the Chicken segment. And I want to ask, when we think about kind of your new more dynamic pricing that you have in that business relative to variable costs, how should we think about the factors that create variability in the chicken margin, be that external or internal factors? And how insulated is that margin now relative to cyclicality in the industry?\nDonnie King: Let me say a couple of things, and then I\u2019ll flip it to David to talk about a few things. We feel very good about -- I feel better about our Chicken business than I have in a long time. And we\u2019re making progress every day. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re not where we want to be at this point. But I would -- if you look at across channels, foodservice, retail, we gained share with branded value-added chicken and foodservice, I think it was 2.6 points or maybe a little more than that in foodservice. We lost a little share because of capacity in retail, the branded portfolio, and we\u2019re gaining that back rather quickly. But as we think about chicken and all these pieces and parts coming together, we\u2019re through the whole live animal livability hatch kind of conversation. We now have the supply chain on the ground that\u2019s going to continue to grow our supply so that we can service the customers in the way that we\u2019d like. We got more fully cooked capacity coming on line, which helps, which is already sold. So we like that. And so we\u2019ll continue to optimize and improve the mix, which helps. And we will brand -- it will be a branded portfolio play as well. But there\u2019s still volatility in grain out there. But we like what we\u2019re seeing. We like our opportunity going forward. And we think we have the foundation of this business in a good place today, and we look for things to improve over Q4 and into next year. David?\nDavid Bray: Yes. I think one other thing to mention to that, Ben, and it\u2019s despite what we\u2019re seeing from an inflationary standpoint and despite what we\u2019re seeing from an overall grain volatility standpoint, we\u2019re continuing to progress as planned. And a large part of that was changing the way that we worked with our great customers across the country and pricing more closer to what\u2019s going on within the market as well as inflation. And we\u2019re pricing quarterly now versus what we would have done previously from a 52-week standpoint. So, it\u2019s given us a lot more flexibility in what we do. But again, there\u2019s a lot of other things that we are doing that will put us in a position to win. And again, the volume unlock that we will see coming into this quarter will go a long way to help us build a much more sustainable model.\nStewart Glendinning: Ben, Stewart. Just want to add one thing there. Don\u2019t overlook in David\u2019s model, the leverage that you\u2019ll get from the increased volume. So you see them going up to 40 million birds this quarter. Every time he adds to those birds, they\u2019re not coming at any increase in fixed costs. That\u2019s already been paid for. And that\u2019s going to be helped as P&L.\nBen Bienvenu: Yes. Okay, great. My second question is around beef. And I appreciate the commentary around margins into next year as we navigate through the cycle. I\u2019d be curious when thinking about that margin commentary for next year, would you characterize those margins as mid-cycle trough cycle margins kind of as we think about the up versus down in that business line, recognizing it\u2019s hard to see exactly where we are in the cycle, that would be helpful to us, I think.\nShane Miller: Yes. So Ben, this is Shane. I think the way I would characterize it is as we\u2019re -- this year, we\u2019re in the 11% to 13% range for fiscal year \u201822. And as we transition to less numbers and back to the prior conversation around trying to pinpoint exactly when this has flipped, it\u2019s like trying to predict the weather right now. So, it\u2019s awfully difficult to do that. I would say it\u2019d be more of the midterm. We believe over time -- to Donnie\u2019s earlier point, over time, we\u2019re going to be trading somewhere in the 5% to 7% returns in our Beef business. And we think about it in a couple of ways to, as you think about how we\u2019re decommoditizing this business is the quality aspect that I mentioned earlier. We\u2019re partnered with some of the best cattle feeders in the world. And when you look at this global demand, it\u2019s going to continue. And we\u2019re not able to service all of that today because of some of the disruptions at the ports that we\u2019re dealing with. And having the ability to value up these components through our case-ready business through Prepared Foods and then also through our International business unit is an additional pro that this company has. So, we feel like we\u2019re going to be scaling into that here as we go through the next 12 to 18 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America.\nPeter Galbo: Just two really quick ones for me. Shane and Donnie, maybe just to stick on the beef topic, and I know we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground there. But one of the questions we\u2019ve gotten, just given the level of liquidation you\u2019ve seen this year, realizing the 5% to 7% kind of medium-term margin target, like what\u2019s the possibility though that next year comes in somewhat below that just because you\u2019re dealing with such a high level of liquidation this year that\u2019s relatively unprecedented?\nShane Miller: Yes. So, thanks for the question. Similar to the comments I just made, it\u2019s -- we are still seeing quite a bit of cattle liquidation. To add a little more color to that, you haven\u2019t seen a hype of retention yet really start to build back. So if you think of the time line to building back the cap crop and so forth. It\u2019s going to be a 2- to 3-year cycle. And then, in respect to the 5% to 7% comment, we feel like we\u2019re in a good spot. I mean, unfortunately, we can\u2019t control mother nature and the drought conditions we\u2019re dealing with here. But there\u2019s still further liquidation, I think that\u2019s going to occur and trying to pinpoint exactly when that finishes up and we start to see more half retention is awfully challenging. The most recent cattle on feed numbers would show the third highest amount here as of July 1st. So we have plenty of cattle in -- here today that are going to take us through the balance of this quarter, obviously, and then into our fiscal -- excuse me, Q1 of fiscal \u201823. But in respect to overall, the 5% to 7% range, I still feel good about where we\u2019re at.\nPeter Galbo: Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Shane. And then, maybe just a technical one for Stewart and Noelle, on Prepared\u2019s margins. Again, kind of exiting this year at the kind of high 7s, low 8s that Stewart mentioned. Just what\u2019s it going to take to build that back to a double digit? I know you had just come out of 2Q at 11%, but now it seems like those margins have taken a step back and based on some of your commentary, it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a lot more pricing that can go through. So, like what do we need to see, I guess, to restore those margins back to a double-digit run rate?\nNoelle O\u2019Mara: Sure. I can take that. So, our building blocks remain the same. Just taking a step back, we play in attractive categories. We have leading share positions in those categories. Top line growth will come from the actions that we\u2019re taking to increase capacity into investments in innovation and continued equity building. We\u2019ll continue to have disciplined revenue management and cost transformation to drive our bottom line. So, while I expect a continued dynamic marketplace, I believe we have the right building blocks in place and our path to deliver the sustainable double-digit margins.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Maybe just to build on that, I think as Noelle focuses on recovering some of that foodservice volume, and I guess busy with the merchandising that she was talking about, again, you\u2019ll start then to see that she has the potential to gain volume and to start gaining back some of that fixed cost deleverage.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to our next question. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: A few additional questions on Chicken. I think you are guiding to the low end of your margin range for Chicken as well. Does that reflect a weaker outlook for 4Q, or is 4Q pretty much how you thought it would be? And then also, you mentioned you\u2019re trying to get to top quartile among your peers. Your peers are, from what I can see, like delivering really strong margins. So where are you now versus that top quartile? Are you in top 50%, or are you below it?\nShane Miller: So, a couple of things there. So first and foremost, within Q4, I would say we are on track with our expectations. What we\u2019ve done through the course of FY22 is make a lot of changes within our business related to mix. And the industry from that standpoint, has had strong favorability because it\u2019s been tied to a big bird debone breast meat market. As you know, Tyson does not operate in that, and we\u2019re continuing to shift towards what is more of a value-added standpoint. As we think about benchmarking versus our competition, we are making progress. And the biggest piece of that, Robert, is us getting our volume back in our facilities. And we\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about being 37 million head and growing that to 40 million head during the Q4 time frame will put us in a much stronger position as we work to close out this year.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And a follow-up. The USDA for next year is forecasting even less than 1% volume growth for chicken. Do you think that\u2019s like the right amount of volume for the market given the demand framework? From what you\u2019re reporting, pricing is up a lot, but demand has been pretty stable. Do you think that that\u2019s in line with how the overall industry will perform?\nShane Miller: So, I would tell you -- so from a chicken standpoint and especially as we enter into the Q4 time frame, what we\u2019re seeing from a demand standpoint in both foodservice and retail continues to be strong. And our customer orders continue to outpace our ability to fill them. And again, with additional volume coming through, we will be in a much better position to service our customers, but we anticipate strong demand in both retail and foodservice to continue.\nRobert Moskow: So, does that mean that 1% supply growth is not enough to meet the market?\nShane Miller: Well, we will grow in excess of that next year. So, we will be driving a lot of share within the industry next year, as we continue to increase our head. I think there is an opportunity for chicken to be very strong from a demand standpoint as we go into \u201823.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.\nKen Zaslow: I just want to follow up on just Rob\u2019s question real quick. Where do you think chicken production will be in 2022, where do you think beef production will be in -- I\u2019m sorry, in 2023, I\u2019m sorry. Where do you think chicken production will be in 2023, where do you think beef production will be in 2023? Just trying to get a flavor for that.\nDonnie King: Based on what was quoted in the prior call, USDA is reporting a 1%, maybe a flat to I think that\u2019s probably realistic. I think our demand is going to be stronger than that as we go into \u201823. And from a beef perspective, with the herd liquidation, there\u2019s going to be fewer -- there\u2019s going to be fewer cattle in the harvest. And you\u2019re going to have more and more packers chasing those heads, particularly the -- those which have better genetics that grade better that provide additional revenue and margin opportunity. And so that\u2019s going to become very tight. And as we move into \u201823 and even into \u201824, beef is going to see some -- you\u2019re going to see some higher cutouts and higher-priced cattle in the marketplace.\nKen Zaslow: Okay. In the prepared remarks, it was said kind of about -- there was a supply chain issues in Prepared Foods. As -- you talked about the margin is still at that. I don\u2019t know if -- I maybe I missed it a little bit, but is there options for you guys to improve your supply chain? What are you doing there? And does that have a meaningful impact in 2023, 2024? And I\u2019m not talking about pricing or anything like that, but -- and maybe I misheard in the prepared remarks. So I just thought there was some opportunity in supply chain. Can you talk about that?\nDonnie King: Let me say a couple of things about that, Ken, and then I will flip it to Noelle. What we\u2019re talking about there is a big portion of that, for example, is in the first half, particularly in the first quarter. You may remember that we had a resurgence in COVID at that point. And so, we got a little bit behind and as we started the year or in our second quarter. But we\u2019ve been out of capacity on a few key categories that we\u2019re seeing now come on line. We got more capacity coming on line next year for Prepared Foods. The demand is -- while it\u2019s been impacted a little bit in some key categories around the pricing, it\u2019s still, let\u2019s say, less elastic than maybe you would -- or even our models would have indicated, but we\u2019re still -- we\u2019re seeing some elasticity. But we expect the volume to grow. We expect to put forth a great deal of effort in our supply chain. Those things that we can control, the productivity program, for example, is a huge -- huge for us in the way of automation and technology. We\u2019ve been investing now for over a year, and we\u2019re starting to see some of those things bear fruit, and not only for this quarter, but as we move forward. And so, those investments are paying off. We\u2019re -- some of the things that we\u2019ve done around autonomous planning and trying to eliminate or improve forecast accuracy and eliminate distress and those type of things, we\u2019re much better today than we were a quarter or two quarters ago, but there\u2019s still things to do. But supply chain is improving. We\u2019re running it right. In many cases or in most cases, we are staffed completely, but we just -- we\u2019re looking for opportunities to continue to get better. Noelle, anything you want to add to that?\nNoelle O\u2019Mara: I think you covered it well, Donnie. To your point, we have made significant traction from a labor perspective as we think about automation within our facilities, digitization, the complexity reduction and flexibility that we\u2019ve created in our network. And so, all of those improvements are leading to a better supply picture as we\u2019ve continued to progress through this year and as we are expected to progress through Q4 next year.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will be concluding today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.\nDonnie King: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining our conference call today. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins, channels and geographies, improving operational efficiency and a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. For these reasons, we are confident we will maintain strong volume and profitability in the short term and have future long-term growth ahead of us. At Tyson, we\u2019re focused on making food affordable, accessible and nutritious for our customers and consumers around the world. Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking to you again soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stewart Glendinning",
            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're pleased to report solid results in the third quarter and year-to-date. Sales were up for both, the third quarter and year-to-date, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset the increase in cost of goods. Volumes were down both for the third quarter and year-to-date due to supply constraints and a challenging macroeconomic environment impacting consumer demand. Looking at our sales results by channel. Retail drove $173 million of top line improvement in the third quarter relative to the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, the ongoing recovery in the foodservice channel drove an increase of $165 million. Sales to international markets, including both domestically and internationally produced products, were $339 million greater than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. Donnie covered our earnings and EPS results. Slide 11 bridges operating income for the third quarter, which was $374 million lower than fiscal 2021. Volumes were down 1.9% in the quarter. Our pricing actions, which partially offset the higher input costs, led to higher sales during the quarter. We saw continued increases in cost of goods across the business, in some instances, up to 15%. Notable examples were labor, feed ingredients, live animals and freight costs. SG&A was $20 million unfavorable to the same period last year due to increased investment in advertising and promotional spend and technology-related costs, partially offset by lower commission costs incurred by selling direct to customers rather than via brokers. As Donnie said, we are assessing all of our SG&A expenses across the business to identify non-value-added spend. Savings from our productivity program initiatives continue to have a positive impact on margins. Moving to the Beef segment. Sales were approximately $5 billion for the third quarter, flat versus the same period last year, but up 15% year-to-date at nearly $15 billion. Sales in the quarter remained strong, supported by higher volume but offset by lower average sales price driven by softer consumer demand for premium cuts of beef. Global consumer demand for beef products remains strong, and we expect volume to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as improved labor participation supports higher plant productivity. On expenses, we incurred greater costs during the third quarter versus the comparable prior year period as live cattle costs increased approximately $480 million in the quarter. We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by higher herd liquidation due to drought conditions. We delivered segment operating income of $506 million in the quarter, down 55% versus the prior year comparable period. Our operating margin of 10.2% was lower than the same quarter last year but remains a strong performance. We expect to see Beef margins return closer to an expected long-term 5% to 7% average. Looking next to the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 6% versus the same period last year, but up 4% year-to-date at $4.8 billion. Global demand is being impacted domestically by high retail prices and internationally by the strong dollar, making U.S. pork relatively expensive as compared to alternative sources globally. For the quarter, the average sales price decreased 3.9%. Segment operating income was $25 million and $248 million for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. While down 63% versus the comparable prior year quarter, operating income is down less than 1% year-to-date. Overall operating margins for the segment declined to 1.5% for the quarter. The operating income deterioration was driven by compressed pork margins with rising hog costs and a constrained cutout. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 5% relative to the same period last year and up 9% year-to-date at $7.2 billion. Sales increased despite a volume decline driven by higher average sales prices. Note, part of the volume decline in the quarter was driven by the sale of our pet treats business. Our brand strength and category relevance has enabled continued strong performance across multiple categories. Operating margin for the segment was 7.6% or $186 million for the quarter, up versus last year. Year-to-date, operating margin is 8.9% and flat compared to the prior year at $635 million. Cost of goods continues to increase, pressuring our cost of production. To offset higher costs, we've executed productivity initiatives, revenue management and optimize our spend. To support our growth aspirations, we continue to invest in marketing and trade to increase the market share of our brands. Moving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.4 billion for the quarter, up 26%. Year-to-date, sales are up 25% at $12.3 billion. Average sales price increased in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Our shift in pricing mechanisms to more variable structures has reduced risk by allowing us to be more agile in response to increasing cost of goods. Chicken delivered adjusted operating income of $269 million in the third quarter representing an operating margin of 6.2%. Quarterly operating income increased over the same quarter last year due to higher average sales price and efficiency improvements, partially offset by increased cost of goods. For the third quarter, we experienced $145 million in higher feed ingredient costs versus prior year, and we recognized $23 million in net derivative losses compared to $56 million of net derivative gains in the prior year. Turning to slide 16. Our healthy cash flows and improved balance sheet have continued to support our disciplined capital allocation approach. We remain focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members and business and returning cash to shareholders. We produced $1.9 billion of operating cash flow so far during fiscal year \u201822, and that's after funding a $1.9 billion increase in our working capital. Our leverage ratio at 1.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA demonstrates our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and operational efficiency will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity, market capabilities and profitability. This will support return on capital generation above the market for our shareholders. Finally, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. Year-to-date, we've returned $491 million in dividends and repurchased $693 million of shares, including $170 million of shares during the third quarter. Let's now discuss the financial outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on the strong results year-to-date, we're maintaining our total company sales guidance at a range of $52 billion to $54 billion. We now expect total volume growth to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Looking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments. In Chicken, our operational turnaround is on track, and we expect full year margins to be between 5% and 7%, but at the lower end. Based on the current trends in retail and foodservice, we expect the full year margin in Prepared Foods to be at the lower end of the 8% to 10% range. In Beef, we expect margins to move toward our expected 5% to 7% range as the live cattle to cutout price spread continues to decline. However, we still expect to deliver a full year AOI margin of 11% to 13%. In Pork, due to margin compression from hog costs and global demand headwinds, we're reducing our full year AOI margin outlook to be in the range of 3% to 5%. In International/Other, we anticipate slightly lower results from our foreign operations in fiscal \u201822 due to supply chain disruptions and other impacts related to COVID-19. Our expectations for CapEx and net interest expense are lowered to $1.9 billion and $350 million, respectively. Our tax rate expectation is lowered from approximately 23% to approximately 22.5%. Our net leverage is expected to remain well below 2 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders for the remainder of the year. I'll now turn the call back over to Brandon for Q&A instructions. Brandon? Well, I would just say, Ben, I mean, there's probably a few more moving parts than that. Of course, you're looking at all parts of the business to get to flat. But of course, you're right. I mean, the divestiture is one of those things. Well, I'll just pick up the margin point quickly, and then Noelle can expand on some of the other pieces. But just look from a margin perspective, as I said, we are going to come in at the low end of the range. That gives you a little bit of flex. Certainly, that means that we would just mathematically would be in the high 7s or low 8 for Q4. Sure, of course. Well, look, first, I mean, we're very pleased with the strength of our balance sheet. When you look at our leverage levels, we haven't seen leverage levels like these since 2011, that sort of time frame. So, we're pleased with having come through COVID and put ourselves in a place where we've got a rock-solid balance sheet. With respect to the capital allocation, our capital allocation approach, we've got a very good balanced approach. And that is strengthening our balance sheet, which we've done investing in our business, which you pointed out. We have ramped up our spend on CapEx, and that is good spend because it's coming in at strong returns. And it's helping to grow our business. And then, of course, your question really about why don't we go to the share buyback, I mean, last year, this time, we spent about $50 million on buybacks. This year, we've got almost $700 million. And part of that is catching up on the dilution that we had from last year. So, we'll see how that goes, but we're very pleased with where we are from a balance sheet standpoint. Ben, Stewart. Just want to add one thing there. Don't overlook in David's model, the leverage that you'll get from the increased volume. So you see them going up to 40 million birds this quarter. Every time he adds to those birds, they're not coming at any increase in fixed costs. That's already been paid for. And that's going to be helped as P&L. Yes. Maybe just to build on that, I think as Noelle focuses on recovering some of that foodservice volume, and I guess busy with the merchandising that she was talking about, again, you'll start then to see that she has the potential to gain volume and to start gaining back some of that fixed cost deleverage."

            "name": "Shane Miller",
            "content": "Yes. Ken, good morning and thanks for the question. Yes. So, to Donnie's point earlier, we, as an industry, have moved through the backlog of the COVID impact and the harvest disruptions from COVID. We are still experiencing drought, and I'd say the drought impact is still impacting over 40% of the regions where we grow cattle out in this country. So, the drought is real, and it's still having an impact today. I think getting precise and specific on the timing of when it's going to flip is awfully difficult to do because we're dealing with mother nature right now. But I would say, if you look at beef demand in general, we continue to see real robust demand, not just in the United States, but globally. So, we feel real good from a demand perspective. The quality of beef that we're still bringing to the marketplace is historically strong. Grading continues to maintain a high level. So, from a demand perspective and a quality perspective, we feel real good about this. But as to getting precise on the timing of when that's going to flip, I think that's awfully difficult to do. Yes. So Ben, this is Shane. I think the way I would characterize it is as we're -- this year, we're in the 11% to 13% range for fiscal year \u201822. And as we transition to less numbers and back to the prior conversation around trying to pinpoint exactly when this has flipped, it's like trying to predict the weather right now. So, it's awfully difficult to do that. I would say it'd be more of the midterm. We believe over time -- to Donnie's earlier point, over time, we're going to be trading somewhere in the 5% to 7% returns in our Beef business. And we think about it in a couple of ways to, as you think about how we're decommoditizing this business is the quality aspect that I mentioned earlier. We're partnered with some of the best cattle feeders in the world. And when you look at this global demand, it's going to continue. And we're not able to service all of that today because of some of the disruptions at the ports that we're dealing with. And having the ability to value up these components through our case-ready business through Prepared Foods and then also through our International business unit is an additional pro that this company has. So, we feel like we're going to be scaling into that here as we go through the next 12 to 18 months. Yes. So, thanks for the question. Similar to the comments I just made, it's -- we are still seeing quite a bit of cattle liquidation. To add a little more color to that, you haven't seen a hype of retention yet really start to build back. So if you think of the time line to building back the cap crop and so forth. It's going to be a 2- to 3-year cycle. And then, in respect to the 5% to 7% comment, we feel like we're in a good spot. I mean, unfortunately, we can't control mother nature and the drought conditions we're dealing with here. But there's still further liquidation, I think that's going to occur and trying to pinpoint exactly when that finishes up and we start to see more half retention is awfully challenging. The most recent cattle on feed numbers would show the third highest amount here as of July 1st. So we have plenty of cattle in -- here today that are going to take us through the balance of this quarter, obviously, and then into our fiscal -- excuse me, Q1 of fiscal \u201823. But in respect to overall, the 5% to 7% range, I still feel good about where we're at. So, a couple of things there. So first and foremost, within Q4, I would say we are on track with our expectations. What we've done through the course of FY22 is make a lot of changes within our business related to mix. And the industry from that standpoint, has had strong favorability because it's been tied to a big bird debone breast meat market. As you know, Tyson does not operate in that, and we're continuing to shift towards what is more of a value-added standpoint. As we think about benchmarking versus our competition, we are making progress. And the biggest piece of that, Robert, is us getting our volume back in our facilities. And we've spent a lot of time talking about being 37 million head and growing that to 40 million head during the Q4 time frame will put us in a much stronger position as we work to close out this year. So, I would tell you -- so from a chicken standpoint and especially as we enter into the Q4 time frame, what we're seeing from a demand standpoint in both foodservice and retail continues to be strong. And our customer orders continue to outpace our ability to fill them. And again, with additional volume coming through, we will be in a much better position to service our customers, but we anticipate strong demand in both retail and foodservice to continue. Well, we will grow in excess of that next year. So, we will be driving a lot of share within the industry next year, as we continue to increase our head. I think there is an opportunity for chicken to be very strong from a demand standpoint as we go into \u201823."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thank you, Brandon, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we reported solid third quarter and year-to-date results. We continue to navigate through a complex and dynamic operating environment, and I'm grateful for the hard work and dedication of our team members. Our results would not have been possible without them. At our Investor Day last year, we shared three priorities with you: winning with team members, winning with customers and consumers, and winning with execution. And I'm pleased to say that we're making progress. For team members, our continuing investments are reducing turnover and improving staffing levels. For customers, our service levels are improving. Our execution, we're getting stronger, driving substantial savings and improving business results. I'm confident we're on the right track and recognize that there is more work to do. Let me cover some highlights from the quarter. Our multi-protein portfolio enabled our business results. In the third quarter versus last year, we delivered substantially improved earnings in our Chicken segment as well as higher earnings in Prepared Foods, which partially offset a decline in Beef and Pork earnings and we continue to accelerate our productivity actions to improve efficiency across all segments. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage, up 13% in the last 13 weeks compared to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to be the market share leader in the majority of the retail core categories in which we compete. While gaining share in both bacon and breakfast sausage in 6 of the 9 core business lines, we grew share versus our second quarter. I was also pleased to see continued growth in our e-commerce channel, where approximately 1 in 5 U.S. households bought a Tyson product during the past quarter with e-commerce sales growing 15% versus last year. We're seeing some recovery in the foodservice channel with continued gains in quarterly sales. In broadline distribution, we have seen specific strength in branded value-added chicken, breakfast sausage and bacon. In this challenging economic environment, where our cost of goods has continued to increase, consumer demand for protein remains relatively steady. Our diverse portfolio allows us to meet customer and consumer needs across a broad range of products and price points even as consumers shift between proteins and products. Our balance sheet grew stronger, providing optionality to invest in growth across our portfolio and return cash to shareholders. We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on total shareholder return. Our year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that our diverse portfolio supports. Our growth objectives are growing faster than the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders. Now for highlights from our financial performance. Sales improved 8% for the third quarter and 16% year-to-date compared to the prior period. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price in Chicken and Prepared Foods. Average sales price increased in these segments in response to persistent increase in the cost of goods. Prices were lower in Beef, in line with expectations and Pork segment versus the same quarter last year. We delivered solid operating income of nearly $1 billion because of our diversified portfolio. Year-to-date, we are up 15% over prior year. As expected, year-over-year third quarter earnings were lower as Beef margins declined relative to a year ago, but still performed well in comparison to historical results. Overall, earnings per share came in at $1.94 for the third quarter and $7.10 year-to-date. We remain confident our actions will improve our long-term volume performance. However, our total volume was down both for the quarter and year-to-date. We are focused on overcoming the supply chain challenges, running our plants full and reducing our costs. Chicken volume is up year-to-date, driven by demand and operational improvements, but down for the quarter. Lower quarterly volumes were driven by the fiscal year \u201821 fire at our rendering plant in Hanceville, Alabama as well as lower outside purchases of meat, chicks and eggs. This was partially offset by increased levels of internal harvest versus the same quarter last year, and we expect internal growth to continue as we ramp up our bird supply. For the full year, we expect Chicken to deliver 1% to 2% volume growth. In Prepared Foods, volumes are down 5.5% year-to-date due to supply chain challenges, uneven food service recovery and the impact of increased pricing. Note also that the divestiture of our pet treats business last year drives 1.2% of the total decline. Although retail volume is down, we maintained our market leadership positions. While the foodservice channel continues to recover, volume growth remains strong in the broadline distribution led by breakfast sausage and bacon. In Beef, volumes were down year-to-date but were up 1.3% versus the same quarter last year, and we continued to increase quarter-over-quarter due to higher head throughput and carcass weight. In Pork, volumes were down year-to-date by 2.1% because of limited hog supply and lower export demand. We expect tightness in live hog inventories and declining export demand to continue to impact volumes in the fourth quarter. In the International/Other segment, volumes are up 11.7% year-to-date and 21.9% versus the same quarter last year. Investments in capacity, innovation and brands are supporting our market share growth. Volume growth was driven by our strengthening QSR and retail performance. Overall, our International business is growing both organically and inorganically. During Q4, we signed a joint venture agreement with Tanmiah Food Company in Saudi Arabia. This partnership will enable us to better serve our large global customers as well as expand our reach to new customers in the Middle East. We're investing in new plants and expanding existing capacity across our global network. 8 plants are being constructed, with 2 expected to begin operation this fiscal year and 6 more by the end of fiscal year \u201823. This additional capacity will enable our team to address capacity constraints accelerate our value-added growth and better serve growing consumer demand for protein. We continue to make significant investments to attract and retain team members, including childcare, citizenship support, transportation, free technical and college education, on-site health clinics, maternity and paternity leave and other health benefits. Our nearside health centers in rural communities are seeing increased usage. These clinics provide team members, spouses and dependents, comprehensive health care services at little to no cost. Investment in team members are making an impact as higher pay and enhanced benefit offerings have led to lower turnover and absenteeism in our plants, which positions Tyson for future growth. We are committed to creating a differentiated work experience for our team members. These investments we're making in our people are part of our broader effort to evolve our business from an ESG standpoint. Over the past several years, we have made many investments to these ends. Today, we are focused on three core pillars of our ESG framework, the formula to feed the future. Those 3 pillars are reimagine people and community impact, drive product responsibility from farm to table, and working toward achieving net zero. Earlier this quarter, we released our sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our ambition and commitments to become the world's most sustainable and transparent protein company. In addition to the investments in people I mentioned a few moments ago, we also highlighted in our report our efforts around animal welfare, sustainable packaging, minimizing waste, water stewardship and working within our operations and supply chain to reduce emissions. We're setting aggressive ESG goals and working to meet them. As we run our business better, we are making process improvements, digitalizing the supply chain, increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations. Our productivity program continues to deliver at the upper range of our initial projections and we'll realize more than $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal year 2024. We're continuing to accelerate digitalization across Tyson through supply chain planning and executional processes to better serve our customer. Automation remains a top priority for our business, and I'm very pleased with the aggressive rollout of automation technologies. And given the macroeconomic environment, we are taking action to cut cost, reduce spend and reassess every role across the business to ensure that the work we do is value added for our customers and consumers. Finally, as we look for new and innovative ideas that can have the greatest impact on Tyson's productivity and sustainability objectives, we held the first-ever Tyson Demo Day. More than 100 companies were considered as presenters for the Demo Day, 20 were selected to make their pitch and ultimately, 6 companies were chosen for partnership. We are committed to strengthening our position as a global protein leader, and driving value creation for our shareholders. At our Investor Day, we outlined 5 imperatives for strengthening our position as a global protein leader. I've spoken about transforming our team member experience, increasing capacity, investing in digital and automation and the strength of our balance sheet. Chicken remains a key focus for our long-term success, and we are executing against our road map to restore top quartile performance for this segment. This quarter, we surpassed a 6% adjusted operating margin. We expect to reach 40 million head per week by the end of this fiscal year, and to continue to grow after that, enabling us to maximize our fixed cost leverage and grow our value-added business. We are optimizing our plant network by adding fully cooked capacity, converting plants for value-added production, implementing plant flexibility and optimizing our portfolio mix. We have come a long way and have more work to do, but I'm pleased with the progress that we are making in Chicken. As we look to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business. We will have invested nearly $1.9 billion in fiscal year \u201822 focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives. Year-to-date, we returned to shareholders approximately $1.2 billion in dividends and share repurchases as we continue to prioritize shareholder return. I will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the third quarter. Thank you, Ben, for that question. The turnaround that we've talked about for the last year now continues. And I'm pleased with the progress that we've made and said that in the script. We still have work to do, grain and the volatility around grain, supply, demand, so forth, still exists out there. But the demand for chicken is extremely strong. Demand for ready-to-eat chicken, for example, is very strong. And we're at capacity as it relates to that. We are investing and have a new asset coming on line early next year, and that will obviously be a help. But the business did grow. And there's a lot of noise in this particular quarter around the Hanceville fire in Q4 of \u201821 that we'll work through. But the thing I want you to hear is that our harvest rates continue to improve, and there will be over -- there'll be $40 million or so in Q4, and it will continue to grow from there. But I want to stop and pause at that point, and I'm going to pass it to David Bray, and David, if you'd like to add some more color. Okay. I'll start, and then I will flip it over to Noelle to add some details. But I would start with that we are seeing some movements in the marketplace between foodservice to retail. In-home dining continues to increase in this environment, which we would -- suspected. We're also seeing some movement from quick service chain account type business to more in -- on-premise dining as COVID wanes and the people are more adventurous that they get out. And so we're seeing some improvement in that as well. But I would tell you, overall, we are starting to see some elasticity, but I would tell you they're below what historical elasticity you would expect. Noelle, anything you'd like to add to that? We still are maintaining our guidance for the segment to 11% to 13% for the full year. I think our number was 10.2%. The cost increases we're seeing on cattle are certainly impacting the spread. And we've been talking now for a number of periods about the fact that there were going to be fewer cattle. I think we're current now from the cattle that we're involved in the backlog of COVID. We're current on that. The prices of those animals have continued to increase. And so, there's drought and all those kind of conversations. But let me flip it over to Shane, and I'll let him give you some color around beef. Yes. I'll just reiterate what I said before, Ken, is, for the full year, 11% to 13%, we'll see this move to, let's call it, 6% to 8% as we're in Q4, the latter part of Q4. And then over time, let's talk \u201823, we've been saying for a couple of quarters now that we see that being a 5% to 7%, which is lower than where we've been over the last couple of years, but versus the historical level, what we would be seeing there is very much in line with what we've built into our modeling and what we would anticipate. Let me say a couple of things, and then I'll flip it to David to talk about a few things. We feel very good about -- I feel better about our Chicken business than I have in a long time. And we're making progress every day. As I mentioned earlier, we're not where we want to be at this point. But I would -- if you look at across channels, foodservice, retail, we gained share with branded value-added chicken and foodservice, I think it was 2.6 points or maybe a little more than that in foodservice. We lost a little share because of capacity in retail, the branded portfolio, and we're gaining that back rather quickly. But as we think about chicken and all these pieces and parts coming together, we're through the whole live animal livability hatch kind of conversation. We now have the supply chain on the ground that's going to continue to grow our supply so that we can service the customers in the way that we'd like. We got more fully cooked capacity coming on line, which helps, which is already sold. So we like that. And so we'll continue to optimize and improve the mix, which helps. And we will brand -- it will be a branded portfolio play as well. But there's still volatility in grain out there. But we like what we're seeing. We like our opportunity going forward. And we think we have the foundation of this business in a good place today, and we look for things to improve over Q4 and into next year. David? Based on what was quoted in the prior call, USDA is reporting a 1%, maybe a flat to I think that's probably realistic. I think our demand is going to be stronger than that as we go into \u201823. And from a beef perspective, with the herd liquidation, there's going to be fewer -- there's going to be fewer cattle in the harvest. And you're going to have more and more packers chasing those heads, particularly the -- those which have better genetics that grade better that provide additional revenue and margin opportunity. And so that's going to become very tight. And as we move into \u201823 and even into \u201824, beef is going to see some -- you're going to see some higher cutouts and higher-priced cattle in the marketplace. Let me say a couple of things about that, Ken, and then I will flip it to Noelle. What we're talking about there is a big portion of that, for example, is in the first half, particularly in the first quarter. You may remember that we had a resurgence in COVID at that point. And so, we got a little bit behind and as we started the year or in our second quarter. But we've been out of capacity on a few key categories that we're seeing now come on line. We got more capacity coming on line next year for Prepared Foods. The demand is -- while it's been impacted a little bit in some key categories around the pricing, it's still, let's say, less elastic than maybe you would -- or even our models would have indicated, but we're still -- we're seeing some elasticity. But we expect the volume to grow. We expect to put forth a great deal of effort in our supply chain. Those things that we can control, the productivity program, for example, is a huge -- huge for us in the way of automation and technology. We've been investing now for over a year, and we're starting to see some of those things bear fruit, and not only for this quarter, but as we move forward. And so, those investments are paying off. We're -- some of the things that we've done around autonomous planning and trying to eliminate or improve forecast accuracy and eliminate distress and those type of things, we're much better today than we were a quarter or two quarters ago, but there's still things to do. But supply chain is improving. We're running it right. In many cases or in most cases, we are staffed completely, but we just -- we're looking for opportunities to continue to get better. Noelle, anything you want to add to that? Okay. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining our conference call today. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins, channels and geographies, improving operational efficiency and a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. For these reasons, we are confident we will maintain strong volume and profitability in the short term and have future long-term growth ahead of us. At Tyson, we're focused on making food affordable, accessible and nutritious for our customers and consumers around the world. Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking to you again soon."

            "name": "David Bray",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning, Ben, and just a little bit of additional color to that. And I think it's important to note that we're doing what we said we would do in chicken. And we are progressing, but we are far from finished. And we know where our opportunities exist. And a large part of that will be uncovered as we can see that our volume grow through the Q4 time frame. The ability for us to process more head through our facilities will help us from a cost standpoint, which will benefit us as we continue to progress through FY \u201824 -- \u201823. And as Donnie stated, we are seeing share gains. Our harvest is up and we will continue to grow share through the Q4 time frame and into FY \u201823 as well. Yes. I think one other thing to mention to that, Ben, and it's despite what we're seeing from an inflationary standpoint and despite what we're seeing from an overall grain volatility standpoint, we're continuing to progress as planned. And a large part of that was changing the way that we worked with our great customers across the country and pricing more closer to what's going on within the market as well as inflation. And we're pricing quarterly now versus what we would have done previously from a 52-week standpoint. So, it's given us a lot more flexibility in what we do. But again, there's a lot of other things that we are doing that will put us in a position to win. And again, the volume unlock that we will see coming into this quarter will go a long way to help us build a much more sustainable model."
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Noelle O'Mara",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks for the question, Alexia. As I look at our prepared performance holistically, top line remains strong behind disciplined revenue management actions and profit is above prior year's. Pricing and productivity are partially offset by the cost of good increases. And as referenced, our prepared volumes on an organic basis are down about 5.5% year-to-date. And it's really three key focus areas. The first is supply. We continue to not be able to fill all of the orders that we have across our portfolio. And as capacity continues to come on line and as we improve our supply capabilities, it will allow us to not only improve availability but also merchandising that's been suppressed. And so, you'll see as those improvements continue to take shape in Q4, us investing back in merchandising. The second area is really around pricing. And as Donnie referenced -- well, elasticity are better than historical lows, they still are impacting the business. And given the macroeconomic environment, we're ensuring that we provide a breadth of value offerings across our portfolio, and you'll see us launching items focused on opium price points as well as larger sizes that can provide consumers value. And then, the third area is really foodservice recovery. And we're focused on not only getting back volume that we lost during the pandemic, but also driving portfolio offerings in many solutions that align to the operator and consumer needs. So, what I feel good about is we have categories that continue to outpace total food and beverage. We have a portfolio of leading brands and a focus on continuing to innovate and meet our consumer and customer needs in an obviously a very dynamic environment. And despite the continued market challenges, I'm expecting volume growth in the coming quarter is driven by the improved supply, the commercial investments in merchandising and innovation and continued food service recovery. As we look at private label performance, we don't see any acceleration as we look at the past couple of periods. Where we do see share pressure in our portfolio, we also see the availability of merchandising lagging versus prior year. So, that's why going back to our focus is on supply, our focus is on driving that volume so we can get back to the availability levels as well as the merchandising performance in the quarters ahead. Just to build on Stewart's comment. So, when you look at industry forecasts, we do show a slowdown in \u201822. However, the industry is still expected to rebound by 2025. And this unevenness of recovery's due to two things, the macroeconomic landscape as well as mix shifting between channels. So, we see that, as Donnie referenced, with improved consumer mobility and comfort eating out, we see an increase in on-premise dining and a slowdown in some of the quick service restaurants that had originally led through the recovery. We've specifically seen some slowdown in our tortillas and pepperoni business that index against our commercial chain accounts. And we gave up some of the volume through the pandemic because of the spike in the demand. And so, we're not only focused on getting back volume, but also, as I referenced, innovating and partnering with customers to ensure that we're leading through the overall recovery. Sure. I can take that. So, our building blocks remain the same. Just taking a step back, we play in attractive categories. We have leading share positions in those categories. Top line growth will come from the actions that we're taking to increase capacity into investments in innovation and continued equity building. We'll continue to have disciplined revenue management and cost transformation to drive our bottom line. So, while I expect a continued dynamic marketplace, I believe we have the right building blocks in place and our path to deliver the sustainable double-digit margins. I think you covered it well, Donnie. To your point, we have made significant traction from a labor perspective as we think about automation within our facilities, digitization, the complexity reduction and flexibility that we've created in our network. And so, all of those improvements are leading to a better supply picture as we've continued to progress through this year and as we are expected to progress through Q4 next year."

I'll now turn the call over to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thank you, Megan, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we reported strong second quarter and first half fiscal year '22 results. Our results would not have been possible without the work of our team members. I'm grateful for their dedication and diligent efforts this quarter as we continue to manage a complex and dynamic operating environment. We delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth driven by strong market fundamentals, acceleration of our productivity actions and improving operational execution across our segments. Our diverse protein portfolio, omnichannel capabilities, leading brands and value-added products all contributed to our results. Strong performance in our Beef segment, continued recovery in Prepared Foods and an improvement in Chicken supported improved sales and earnings. Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, have driven strong share performance in the retail channel since the onset of the pandemic. This quarter, we delivered share gains in bacon, hotdogs and snacking. We also continue to see recovery in the foodservice channel with our relative strength in QSRs and K-12, supporting continued share gains in branded value-added chicken. Overall, consumer demand for protein has remained strong, and we are taking deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes to better meet customer needs, including investing in new capacity, brands, product innovation and our team member experience. We are seeing our investments in team members making an impact. Despite continued labor challenge during the Omicron surge this quarter, we're seeing lower turnover and absenteeism. We have invested in higher wages, benefits and other workplace enhancements, such as flexible schedules, child care and transportation. The construction of new plants continues to progress. This additional capacity will enable our team to address capacity constraints and better serve growing demand for protein across all segments. Along with ramping up utilization of our newest plant in Humboldt, Eagle Mountain and Thailand, we have 4 plants expected to commence operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. In addition to the new sites, we're continually upgrading capacity as needed with approximately 10 projects planned in the third quarter, representing 25 million pounds of volume in Prepared Foods alone. In addition, we are working closely with our customers to ensure that the fair value of our products incorporates the inflationary cost pressures impacting our business. For the first half, our cost of goods sold rose 15% relative to the same period last year. Every part of our business has been impacted by inflation. We experienced higher costs across our supply chain for all inputs from feed ingredients, live animals and other raw materials to cooking oils and basic supplies. We're also managing higher cost of labor and transportation due to robust demand, higher fuel costs and limited availability. As part of our effort to combat inflation and increase profitability, I'm pleased by our accomplishments to drive costs lower by accelerating our productivity actions. Also, our balance sheet and liquidity position remain healthy, providing optionality to invest in growth across our portfolio and return cash to shareholders. We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on total shareholder return. Our first half results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives and that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins and driving stronger returns for our shareholders.  Now turning to the financial results. Let me give you some highlights. Sales improved 16% in the second quarter and 20% during the first half. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price and mix improvement. Average sales price trends reflect disciplined revenue management strategies in the context of a volatile, high-inflation environment. Like many other companies, we've seen varying levels of heightened inflation, notably in grains, labor, live animals, raw material and transportation costs. As I mentioned earlier, our teams have worked together with our customers to manage inflationary pressures. We delivered solid operating income performance, up 57% during the second quarter and 47% for the first half. The performance in the first half was due to strength in Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods. Overall, our operating income performance translated to $2.29 in earnings per share for the second quarter, up 71% and $5.16 in earnings per share for the first half of 57%.  Looking at our results on volume. We remain confident that our actions will improve our performance, but we are not where we expect it to be by now as we faced the Omicron surge in the quarter and other labor and supply chain challenges. Due to these factors, our total volume was down slightly for the first half versus last year. Chicken remained a bright spot, where volume was up 2.1% through the first half compared to the same period last year. This improvement was driven by solid fundamental demand as well as operational improvements. There is much more work to be done as we focus on filling our existing capacity. We are pulling multiple levers to drive sequential improvement in our performance. And as a result, I'm confident that we will see continued volume performance in the second half. In Prepared Foods, volumes were down 4% in the first half compared to the same period last year. Approximately 1/3 of this decline was related to the pet treats divestiture with the remainder of the result of a challenging supply environment and uneven recovery of the foodservice channel. We are working to improve these results over the remainder of FY '22 as we continue to take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization. In Beef, volumes were down 2.9% in the first half compared to the same period last year. However, beef volumes increased quarter-over-quarter due to higher harvest weights. We expect continued volume improvements for the remainder of our fiscal year '22 as new team member recruitment strategies support an improved labor position and higher throughput. In Pork, impacts associated with a challenging labor environment contributed to a 2.3% decline in volume in the first half compared to the same period last year. We expect tightness in live hog inventories to affect our second half volume. In International/Other, our investments in capacity, innovation and brands are supporting our market share growth objectives and volume improvement. Overall, we will continue to take actions across our business to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix and align our portfolio with customer and consumer needs. Although we have reduced our expectations for the full year, we still expect to grow our total company volumes in fiscal year '22. We continue to take meaningful action toward becoming the most sought-after place to work, and we're making significant investments to attract and retain team members. Our U.S.-based workforce is comprised of team members from more than 160 countries. In April, we announced that we are investing over $1 million in several non-profit groups to expand legal and citizenship support for the team members aspiring to become U.S. citizens. This will allow us to scale a program from 7 Tyson facilities to serve 40 company locations in 14 states. We recently announced an expansion of the Upward Academy program as our latest investment in our team members. Starting the summer, U.S. team members will have access to free education, including masters, undergraduate and associate degrees, career certificates as well as class in literacy and technology fundamentals. And Tyson will pay 100% of the cost of tuition, books and fees with an estimated investment of $60 million over the next 4 years. Ensuring the health and safety of our global team is a top priority. We continue to challenge ourselves to be an organization that stays ahead of the unforeseen event and adjusting our protocols to keep our team members healthy and safe. We have educated and encouraged team members to get vaccine boosters and have offered over 100 clinics across our office and plant locations.  We are also investing to support team member well-being more proactively in our rural communities. We now have 7 on or near-site Tyson health centers opened and operating. These clinics provide comprehensive health care services, including preventive screenings, chronic condition coaching, mental health counseling, lab services and sick visits at little to no cost to most of our team members or their spouses and dependents. Overall, we're confident that our actions will increase Tyson staff levels and position us for future growth, and we will continue to explore innovative benefit offerings that make our team members' lives better. We're making excellent progress on our productivity program, which will deliver more than $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal year '24. Based on current progress, we now expect to deliver more than $400 million of savings in fiscal year '22, which is on the high end of our previously disclosed range for the year. Last quarter, I highlighted our work in Prepared Foods to build a digital manufacturing platform that utilizes data to simplify complexity and optimize processing. I also shared our work to enhance the mix and allocation of our trucking fleet resources to enable better on-time deliveries to customers. This quarter, deployment of our Tyson production system approach has improved our yield across all segments versus a year ago. Additionally, our procurement program is addressing total company spend, including direct material as well as plant and corporate indirect areas. This program continues to deliver savings in line with expectations. Our digital solutions journey has also progressed. In our supply chain, we are leveraging new processes and digital tools to quickly identify gaps in fulfillment. Meeting the demands of our customers on time and in full is of the utmost priority, and we are continuing to maximize our service levels. The early results of our finance automation and digitization work also remain promising. For example, this program is providing more accurate billing and improved collections for Tyson while lowering our intensive labor. We are also investing aggressively in automation and technology to help address some of our most difficult roles in repetitive tasks. This is a well-planned program of automation to use common designs and equipment across our plants to optimize cost, maintenance and asset utilization. The debone automation program is continuing to scale in plants, and our Tyson proprietary debone automation solution is also beginning to roll out in select facilities. Looking ahead, we're starting to scale new programs like pack-out robotics to continue automating highly manual processes and deliver savings. Chicken remains a top priority, and we continue to execute against our road map to restore top-quartile profitability for this segment. We've been committed to returning our operating margins to 5% to 7% level by the middle of FY '22. This quarter, we delivered a 5% adjusted operating margin, in line with our previously communicated plan. Critical to improving our profitability is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, being staffed to standard and having enough workers to run our plants full. Since September, we have seen an improvement in our hatch rate that is consistent with the expectations that we shared at our December Investor Day. We are committed to growing our harvest capacity utilization, and we outpaced the industry in the second quarter. Achieving improved chicken harvest and higher capacity utilization will allow us to build on the volume growth delivered by Chicken in the first half. In parallel to actions to improve volume, we have also worked with customers to manage inflationary pressures by adjusting pricing to achieve a fair value for our products. This will be important to ensuring we deliver sequential improvement in our operating margins in the second half of fiscal year '22, especially with continued increases in key input costs such as labor and feed ingredients. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are also making good progress on our automation objectives for the segment. This includes the rollout of debone automation and a range of other equipment, which will enhance our productivity and cost effectiveness. We have come a long way in a short period of time, and I'm pleased with the progress we are making in Chicken. To recap, we have strong consumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels and a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. 5 imperatives on this slide show how we will achieve our commitments and drive value creation for our shareholders. This starts first with our commitment to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as well as investing in improving our team member experience.  Second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better address demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales. As a result, we expect our volume to outpace overall market growth over the next several years.  Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment and continue to achieve key milestones on our road map to top-quartile profitability.  Fourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence in investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our productivity program, where we are accelerating our efforts and now expect to deliver more than $400 million in savings this year.  Fifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business. We're on track to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. We also continue to return cash to shareholders. Through the first half, we returned approximately $850 million in dividends and share repurchases.  As a final comment before turning the call over to Stewart, I want to highlight that Tyson Foods understands we have a critical role to play in the global food system to make it more resilient, more sustainable and more equitable for current and future generations. Just recently, we completed a materiality analysis that will inform our long-range strategy. These insights from key stakeholders shape our strategic framework and provide direction on the expectations of our company. I will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through more detail on the financial results for the second quarter.\nStewart Glendinning: Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're pleased to report strong results in the second quarter and first half of this fiscal year. Sales were up in the second quarter and the first half, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset inflation as well as improved product and channel mix. Volumes were down slightly through the first half impacted by continued labor challenges and a temporary disruption from the Omicron variant surge. Looking at our sales results by channel. Retail drove $424 million of top line improvement in the second quarter relative to the same quarter last year. Through the first half, retail sales have improved $773 million. In the second quarter, improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $684 million, and domestic export sales to international markets were $311 million stronger than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. Second quarter adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion was up 57% relative to the same quarter last year, led by increases in Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods. First half adjusted operating income of $2.6 billion was up 47%, supported by increases in Beef and Chicken. Driven by the strong increase in operating income, second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.29 grew 71% compared to the same period last year. Second quarter earnings per share also benefited from lower net interest expense and higher other income. Slide 11 bridges year-to-date operating income for the second quarter, which was $422 million higher than fiscal 2021. Volumes were down 1.5% in the second quarter. Volume improvement in Chicken, International/Other and Beef were offset by declines in Pork and Prepared Foods, where continued labor and supply chain challenges impacted throughput. Our pricing mix and portfolio efforts led to higher sales during the quarter, which offset the higher input costs. We saw continued inflation across the business, in some instances, up 25% or more. Notable examples were labor feed ingredients, live cattle, lean hogs and freight costs. SG&A was $46 million unfavorable to the same period last year due to increased team member-related costs and investments in advertising and promotional spend in support of our brands. As a final note, both cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses in the quarter were partially offset by productivity savings.  Moving to the Beef segment on Slide 12. Segment sales were approximately $5 billion for the second quarter, up 24% versus the same period last year. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by continued robust demand for Beef products, which supported higher average sales price and volume. The cutout and our average sales price remained relatively strong during the quarter despite some consumer demand shifting toward lower-cost beef cuts. Quarterly volume improved compared to the prior year despite the Omicron surge experienced by the business. We expect volume to continue to improve in the second half of this fiscal year as new team member recruitment strategies support improved staffing and higher throughput levels. On expenses, we incurred greater costs during the second quarter versus the comparable period a year ago as live capital costs increased approximately $545 million in the quarter. We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by higher herd liquidation due to drought conditions. As of February, 54% of capital inventory were in areas experiencing drought conditions, which may lead to additional herd liquidation through the remainder of the fiscal year. We delivered segment operating income of $638 million in the quarter, up 43% versus the comparable period. This improvement was driven by solid global demand for Beef products, supporting a higher cutout as well as higher specialty product values, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Our operating margin of 12.7% was higher than the same quarter last year but was down on a sequential basis versus the last 2 quarters as cost increases led to a narrowing of the spread.  Looking next at the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 6% versus the same period last year. Average sales price increased 10.8%, but volumes were 4.8% lower relative to the same period last year. Average sales price was up due to higher input costs, while volumes were lower due to labor challenges from the Omicron surge, which led to lower processing throughput. Segment operating income was $59 million for the quarter, down 12% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined to 3.8%. The operating income deterioration was driven by softer exports, higher input costs and labor challenges. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 11% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down in the quarter given labor and supply chain challenges and uneven foodservice recovery and the sale of our pet treats business. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by higher average sales price. Consumer demand has remained durable even as we worked to manage inflation through price increase. Overall, consumer response to higher price levels is below historical expectations as our brand strength and category relevance has enabled continuing strong demand. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor all increased our cost of production. To offset higher costs, we have executed productivity, revenue management and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through increased marketing and trade support. Operating margins for the segment were 11% or $263 million for the quarter, up 21% versus the same quarter last year.  Moving on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.1 billion for the quarter, up 15%. Volumes improved in the quarter due to strong consumer demand and operational improvements. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes. We expect to deliver further volume improvements in the second half of fiscal 2022 as harvest numbers improve and continue to optimize the operational efficiency of our plants. Average sales price improved 14.4% in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to price recovery offsetting inflationary costs. On pricing, we made meaningful progress to shift our pricing mechanisms toward more variable structures and are now seeing those benefits. We restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal 2021 to be more agile in response to market and inflationary conditions. Chicken delivered adjusted operating income of $203 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22, representing an operating margin of 5%. Operating income increased in the second quarter due to increased sales volume and higher average sales prices, partially offset by the impacts of inflationary market conditions, including increased supply chain costs and a challenging labor environment. In the second quarter of fiscal '22, we experienced $100 million of higher feed ingredient costs and $101 million of net derivative gain as compared to $10 million of net derivative gains in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. During the fiscal month of April, the beginning of our third quarter, we have achieved an approximate 5% operating margin, excluding mark-to-market derivative impacts. Restoring competitiveness in our Chicken business remains a top priority, and we are making progress on achieving our long-term targets for adjusted operating margin, but we still have work to do.  Turning to Slide 16. Our healthy cash flows have continued to support a broad capital allocation approach. We are focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. Consistent with our expectations, our operating cash flows were down slightly in the first half of the year due to planned investment in working capital. And consistent of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we used our existing liquidity to retire $1 billion of debt in the second quarter. Since the start of the pandemic, which this quarter now marks 2 years ago, we have reduced gross debt by approximately $3.8 billion. We maintained our leverage ratio at 1.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. This will support strong return on capital generation for our shareholders.  Finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We bought back $175 million of shares at an average price of $88.50 per share during the second quarter. This is in addition to the $348 million of shares repurchased during the first quarter. Let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. Based on the strong first half results, we're raising our total company sales guidance to a range of $52 billion to $54 billion. In support of our sales growth, we now expect 1% to 2% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full.  Looking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments. In Chicken, our operational turnaround is working, and we expect full year margins to be between 5% and 7%. Based on our first half performance, we now expect the full year margin in Prepared Foods to be in the range of 8% to 10%. In Beef, we are raising our AOI margin to 11% to 13%. We still expect the first half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize in the second half. We expect that cattle price increases will reduce the overall margin in the back half. In Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal 2021, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. As is normal seasonality for Pork, we expect the first quarter to be the strongest. In International/Other, we anticipate reduced results from our foreign operations in fiscal '22 due to supply chain disruptions and other impacts related to COVID-19. Our expectations for CapEx, net interest expense and tax rate remain unchanged. Our net leverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality, inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders over the course of the year.  I'll now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&A instructions. Megan?\nMegan Britt: Thanks, Stewart. We'll now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.\nKenneth Goldman: Donnie, I wondered you mentioned your expectation for sequential improvements in operating margins in the back half of the year. I just wanted to clarify, does this mean that you expect your operating margin in 3Q to be above 2Q, so above 8.9%, and then for 4Q to be above that once again? Or are you simply saying that the second half will be above the first half with, I guess, no comment on the cadence of 3Q versus 4Q? I know it's hard to measure these things. I just wanted to be sure what you were suggesting there.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Let me pick that up for Donnie. This is Stewart. I think you can take it as the first half is going to be not as strong as the second half. We haven't got obviously into giving you quarter-by-quarter. But we expect our business to strengthen over the back half. You'll recall from the prepared remarks that we expect our Beef to start to weaken in the second half. So some of that quarter-by-quarter timing will depend a little bit on the timing update.\nKenneth Goldman: Okay. That's helpful. And then how are you thinking about the timing of the cattle cycle right now? What I mean by that is you mentioned that you expected the herd liquidation to continue the rest of the year. Again, no one has a crystal ball on these things. But do you have even a rough estimate for when you might expect the liquidation cycle to end next year?\nDonnie King: Thanks, Ken. This is Donnie. We expect it to -- in fact, we thought we would have already seen lower supply than what we are seeing right now. An interesting data point is that cattle and feed recorded over 12 million, had a record high from March 1. So there's a little bit of noise in that still. Drought conditions and grain costs are certainly impacting supply. But we -- as we said, we think in the back half of the year, we'll see the spread tighten in our Beef business. And -- but I would also point out that we think it will be much higher. In fact, we call it 6% to 8% on a normalized range these days. But it's holding up pretty good right now. And while we're -- it's not going to be a record back half, we think it will be a very good one.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: So I just wanted to dig a little bit more in Chicken and thinking through the margin expectations in the back half of the year specifically and then what that implies as you move into fiscal '23. I think in the prepared comments, you talked about April being at 5% kind of even after any mark-to-market impact on grain. How do we think about the different levers to further margin improvement in Chicken through the back half of the year, whether it's volume in terms of the hatch and your throughput in the slaughter plants, mix, pricing actions versus some of the incremental inflation as we look at grain and some of your other purchasing puts?\nDonnie King: Thanks, Adam. Let me say a few words, and I'll flip it to David Bray to add a few details. It was a year ago this quarter that I talked about the turnaround in Chicken, and in fact, talked about being at a 5% to 7% business. I will tell you, in this quarter, January, from a Omicron resurgence was painful across all of our businesses. But we've improved sequentially throughout the quarter. The back half of the year, in Chicken specifically, the thing that we need is greater volume, greater efficiency from the assets that we currently have. And we've announced a further processing plant that will come online next year that will add some incremental capacity. But our productivity program is working. We are becoming more efficient, and our volume is growing. And I would expect you to see that to continue to grow and develop over the balance of the year. I would tell you, in short, we're on point. And let me put it to David, and he can add.\nDavid Bray: Adam, thank you for the question. I think, first and foremost, what I do want you to hear is that we have made progress within the Chicken segment. But we also know that we have much, much more work to do, and we're focused against that. I would also tell you that we said that we would deliver sequential improvement throughout the fiscal year, and we have. We also shared that we would see improved volumes sequentially. And quarter-over-quarter, we have seen improved volume. And we also said that we would outpace the market for growth. And within the Q2 time frame, we did that as well. In Q2, our harvest head was up 2.9%, and our harvest volume was up 4.9%, which actually allowed pricing to gain share in the Q2 time frame of about 0.75 point. We've also improved our adjusted operating income and our AOI margins sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and this was the case whether we include or exclude any impacts of derivatives against our business. And so again, I would tell you, we're making progress. We have more work to do. We are focused, and our goal has not changed: to be the best chicken company as we focus on the levers of our business. We're continuing to work hard to staff our plants. And today, I would tell you the poultry segment is staffed to standard. We're continuing to work on servicing our customers growing our business and to drive overall operational improvements.\nDonnie King: If I could -- David, if I could add one more thing, Adam. On Friday, we closed on April -- by the way, it was a 5-day close, which is a new record, thanks to Stewart and Philip Thomas and the team. But in Chicken specifically, April was a good month. And Stewart referenced in his prepared remarks around 5%. I can tell you from the close that it's better than 5%. So I'll leave it at that.\nAdam Samuelson: All right. That's really helpful. And if I can maybe just follow up in Chicken. I'm just trying to think about the internal kind of actions you're taking and what you have under your control is very clear. And I'm trying to make sure we can calibrate how the external environment has evolved in terms of record breast meat prices. Maybe some declines in wings, kind of risk around avian influenza and what that could potentially do to exports relative to the grain markets and just trying to think about how changes in that external environment would or would not impact, kind of how you think about chicken moving forward.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Adam. I will tell you, we started over a year ago with 4 -- with what we call our 4 pillars, of which we're staffing our plant, servicing our customers, growing our business, and we're restoring industry-leading operating performance. That's still our plan. As you well know, there are a number of variables going on right now in the poultry business. What I can tell you is volume -- is demand is strong. In fact, I would tell you that if you look at the price of boneless scales breast meat, I think Friday was somewhere around $3.60. It's been a long time since I've seen that kind of strength in breast meat and chicken overall. And so grain is higher, of course. We are seeing that. Dave and his team are responding with shorter-term contracts to try to protect Tyson and try to protect our customers as well. And I'll stop -- put it over to David, if there's anything other things he'd like to add. David?\nDavid Bray: Yes, I think just from the grain standpoint, despite what we're seeing from volatility in grain, the turnaround in Chicken is progressing as planned. And again, a large part of that is based off of our variable pricing structures. We're able to move much faster than we have in the past, and that's been a big benefit to us. Relative to avian influenza hub, yes, we are watching that closely, and it is always a risk within this business. But I would tell you that we mitigate that risk through the use of our biosecurity measures and that they are in place across all of our facilities right now. This includes testing every block that we have for AI before it leaves the farm. We are operating under heightened measures in some geographic areas of the country right now, and the heightened measures would basically be we're limiting the amount of people and trips that are taken to our farms as well as making sure that the people that do go to the farms are in clean vehicles, and we will continue to monitor that. To that, I would tell you that any bird loss related to disease impacts our growers, and it impacts our plants as well, but these have been relatively minimal to our business to date.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens.\nBen Bienvenu: So I want to ask -- I want to follow up on Adam's questions about the Chicken business. Obviously, your commentary on April is quite strong. Your guidance suggests continued strength in that business. If we could -- I want to ask a little bit about the mechanics of what happened in the quarter and kind of mechanics of cost-plus. I think we have an understanding of what happens when you have derivative gains and why. But would you talk about when and why you hedge your grain? And to the extent that we look into the balance of the year and that reflects hedges that you have on and benefits that you might enjoy as a result of that, could you talk about that versus a cost-plus sort of mechanism that as grain prices go up allow you to take high prices? I'm just trying to understand the moving pieces around what we should be mindful of as we monitor the environment going forward.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Let me -- this is Stewart. Let me go ahead the question on hedging. So we hedge primarily when we are obligated to fixed price, particularly any kind of agreements that are longer term that makes sure that we're not exposed to a fixed price with a moving commodity base. This year, we've seen a shift. We've talked about that in a couple of our calls. We have shifted to more variable or commodity-driven pricing, which means that we don't have to hedge as much. Keep in mind also, though, that those pricing mechanisms will have various triggers, and therefore, they won't be repricing every day. And so you will see us, of course, hedging over the shorter term to make sure that during that kind of lag period where we are obligated to price, that we have got protection from those in grains and other commodities. Is that helpful?\nBen Bienvenu: Very helpful, thank you. Pivoting and thinking about the Prepared Foods business, really solid margin results in the quarter, I know there's this cost price dynamics that you and all of your peers are navigating. The back half of the year suggests maybe a little bit of margin pressure and then expansion thereafter. Can you talk about how you feel about your price elasticities in that business, how you feel about your ability to operate the business well and perhaps as we cycle through some of the volume losses from the pet food business -- pet treat business to improve and deliver on fixed cost absorption and your balance of the margin balance when we move through this year and into next year would be helpful.\nDonnie King: Thank you, Ben. Let me hit a couple of points, and I'll flip it over to Noelle, and she can go into greater detail with you. And you saw in our statement, the first half was down. We had lower production throughput. Again, January was troubling with the Omicron resurgence, challenging labor. And we did have the sale of pet treats in the quarter -- or in the first half. We expect the volume to improve. Retail demand remained strong, and we had some uneven recovery in our foodservice business, meaning there are some spots, and I'll call them out specifically, and then I'll flip it to Noelle. In our pizza topping business, for example, it was softer than expected. Our Philly business was softer than expected, and our tortilla business was softer than projected. And with that, I'll flip it over to Noelle, and she can talk about the elasticities.\nNoelle O\u2019Mara: Thanks, Donnie. So as Donnie referenced, demand really does continue to be strong driven by our strong brand equities and our diverse portfolio. And we do see that demand continues to exceed supply in a majority of our categories. We've made significant improvements in our labor vacancy rates. We expect to be back to prepandemic levels. In the second half, we also have investments coming online that we referenced in the prepared remarks on capacity. As Donnie referenced in foodservice, we are seeing a bit of uneven recovery. Overall, I would say it's showing momentum. Where we did see impacts is in January and February, where the Omicron variant surge had a brief negative impact as consumer mobility waned and foodservice traffic declined. This, along with some of the other dynamics from a labor perspective in the industry, slow recovery at the beginning of the year. But as we look at March traffic, the data shows that we are returning to pre-Omicron recovery levels as COVID cases drop back to a bit more normative levels. But broadly speaking, QSRs and stores continue to lead the recovery relative to other channels. We're also seeing great momentum in K-12 and continue to be optimistic in the overall recovery. And as referenced, we continue to make significant impacts on cost transformation. And so you'll continue to see a focus on that holistically for us across the business as we continue to improve labor, as we continue to expand our capacity, as we continue to invest in our portfolio and our leading brands and expect to deliver 8% to 10% ROS for the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America.\nPeter Galbo: Maybe we could start with Beef. You guys have obviously seen your business, I think, disaggregate a bit from some of the third-party sources. And I do think a lot of that probably comes from your export business and maybe some of the byproduct business. But can you talk about maybe those 2 specifically in the quarter and how we should think about them going forward as we monitor external data versus kind of what your report -- stronger results that you're reporting in Beef?\nDonnie King: Peter, I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll pick it to Shane to make a couple. In our Q2, sales volume did increase. We had improved staffing and higher harvest weight. We talked a lot about the fact that we're buying a higher grade of animal, the process. Grades have improved significantly through the last couple of decades, and that continues to be the case for us. But as you pointed out, we're seeing a lot of help from our specialty products group, particularly in the fat and tallow area, our relationship with Jacobs Stearns that we've had there, we're able to take a lot of that product. And with the price of diesel and fuels, we're able to now to get some really bring value out of those products, and that's providing some tailwinds for us in our Beef business. But I'll flip it to Shane, and he can add a little bit more color to that.\nShane Miller: Yes. Thanks, Donnie, and thanks, Peter, for the question. Donnie, he hit on a couple of the categories. Obviously, specialty products, which is everything that's coming off of the drop or the harvest side of our operations, has improved. We continue to see better value coming from the fasten oil category. But also if you think about areas like proteins, you think about herbs, think about some of the variety meats that are typically sold into the export arena, we're seeing very strong demand globally from the product mix that we're supplying to the marketplace. This is still a cyclical business. We believe over that continuum that beef demand will continue to be very strong from a global perspective. And on top of that, if you think about the value that we're bringing to the marketplace and also to -- ultimately to the consumer, the meat quality and the cattle genetics that are being supplied to us today have never been better. So I think as we look forward here, strong quality, great product mix and diversification of customers and programs will lend to stronger support.\nPeter Galbo: That's helpful. And then, Donnie, I just wanted to reconcile some of your comments in Chicken around your hatch plan -- or hatch improvement plan being on track. I think for total company, though, you took the volume guide down and just wanted to understand what that implied around back half chicken volumes. I think previously, we had talked about them being up maybe double digits to kind of make the year. So just wanted to reconcile kind of those 2 aspects.\nDonnie King: Sure. There's a number of things going on there. We had the -- our hatch has improved. We're better than the average of the industry, for example, today. A year ago, we could not say that. So we have seen improvement there. We have also reduced our outside purchase of meat, and that's had a pretty significant impact on our overall volume, in Chicken specifically. We also -- if you'll recall, we had a fire in Huntsville, Alabama that impacted our volume. Not only of the rendered product that we produce ourselves, but on the ability to go buy that on the outside, that had a pretty significant impact as well. So those are kind of the top line things relative to volume. What I will tell you is we grew in the quarter. We grew in the first half. We didn't grow at the rate which we said -- and if you'll recall, we were -- we wanted to grow faster than the market, which we did but not where we want to be in terms of overall volume. And I'll let David touch on some of that.\nDavid Bray: Yes. I think one other comment to that is we have seen several weeks, 5 weeks, of continuous improvement within our live operations. And one big component of what's going to continue to improve for us is we are on track with the delivery of the new male into all of our farms. And so we feel very optimistic about that. It's a male that we know very well. With that, we will continue to see improved hatch rates within our facilities as well as improved weight gain across with the new male coming in.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\nBenjamin Theurer: Donnie, Stewart, congrats on the results. First question, just if you could elaborate a little more about the productivity program and the savings realizations which you had, the roughly $400 million you've mentioned. Can you give us breakdown on like sector basis, how we should think about where our focus has been mainly put within more recently? And where do you think low-hanging fruits are for the back half to deliver here? That would be my first question.\nDonnie King: Sure. Thank you. So in terms of productivity, I'll just start out by reminding what we said in our Investor Day. We said that from an operational and functional excellence perspective between now and '24, we would save $300-plus million. From a digital -- making -- applying digital throughout our supply chain was worth another $250 million, and automation was $450 million. What I can tell you to date is that we will deliver near $400 million in year 1. And each and every day, we identify new things that we can put on our tracker that will deliver better results. But I would want you to take away from this is that there's unprecedented inflation, inflation we haven't seen in generation, really. And so this is not just pricing for inflation. We're also doing everything we know to do to become more productive, a more efficient, a lower-cost producer. And as we say in our poultry business, we want to be top quartile or better in every place that we play, and we still got room to do that. So I'd tell you that we're on track. There are things like trucking fleet resources and optimization, we -- our procurement program to address total company spend and then gas and fulfillment. The debone automation projects that we have in poultry, they're progressing as planned. In fact, they're a little ahead of that. And so we feel good about that. But our future is going to -- one, we have a fair market value price in the marketplace; but two, we want to be among the very best in every place that we participate.\nBenjamin Theurer: Okay. Perfect. And then my follow-up is actually just a quick one for Noelle. On one of her comments she made around the adjusted operating margin in Prepared Foods to get this to the 10% level. So obviously, if we look into, first half was very strong, roughly 9.5%. So that's already the higher end of the range. So how should we think about that 8% to 10%? Is it really achievable at a higher level? Because I think you said something like you want to be at 10%. So you want to be at 10%, but there might be some uncertainty which could bring it down for whatever reason, which we don't know today, but we should more plan on 10% than maybe 8%. Is that fair?\nNoelle O\u2019Mara: So what I'd start by saying is, to your point, and you've heard this in the prepared remarks and Stewart emphasized as well that we had a better-than-expected first half really driven by the actions that we took on price to offset inflationary impacts, the improvements that we saw in labor, the cost transformation starting to come through as well as mix. As I referenced a few minutes ago, the demand expectations that we see continues to outpace supply. And with labor momentum and the capacity investments, we do expect volume improvements as we continue through the second half. We also anticipate continued foodservice recovery. As we look towards the back half on the inflationary side, we do continue to expect inflationary pressures through the back half, which is why it's sort of top of mind on the cost transformation efforts that Donnie just referenced. And so holistically, we're confident about the 8% to 10% ROS range.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Can I dig into the labor cost issue? To begin with, maybe some numbers if you have them, the labor costs as a percentage of COGS, especially in Chicken, your vacancy rates and how they're trending over time? And specifically, just more philosophically, you've been improving pay and benefit for 2 years now since that summer of 2020. And it seems as though the pandemic is easing and yet these labor challenges are persisting. I think you alluded to the diversity of your team members. Is there a more structural problem that with the tightening of integration policies that, that sort of dried up the well of where you can recruit people into those types of roles? And then secondly, on the labor side, I'm just thinking from a cultural perspective, from a morale perspective, I think your automation processes are talking about a 3,000-person reduction in job counts over the next 3 years to fiscal '24. How do you recruit and retain people as you're going through that automation process? I mean, is this like -- I'm trying to get a whether this labor issue is likely to be a persistent problem despite all the efforts that you're making to improve the working conditions.\nDonnie King: Thank you for that question. And I'll hit on a few points. For example, we realize -- fully realize that we have to create a desirable place to work. In fact, we talked about it in terms of being the most sought-after place to work. We realized that those team members that we have can work wherever they choose to work. And we want to give them a reason to work for us. I believe I said in the last call, it is not my objective to fix the labor problem in the United States. My objective is to fix the labor issues that we have at Tyson Foods, and we're doing that. And it's not a -- there's not a one thing that fits all the needs. For example, child care, you can talk about child care, and there's a subset of the population that, that is of value. And -- but there's also other areas where it's not. Transportation is more desired and needed in other areas. We have, in some rural communities, for example, the need for healthcare. So we created on-site or near-site health clinics that our team members and their families have access to little or no cost. And that's one opportunity for us to have a differentiated place to work. It's true, we continue to invest in wages and benefits in booster shots and booster clinics. We've done over 100 of those. And we think we're seeing a positive impact from those things. We're seeing improved absenteeism and turnover rates. We announced that we're going to support team members through non-profits to try to for legal citizenship support. And then 2 weeks ago, I think it was, we announced Upward Academy program. And we're going to spend $60 million over the next 4 years for education for our team members. That's master\u2019s degree, bachelor's degree, associate\u2019s degrees, live skills training, English, for example, whatever we can do to try to differentiate Tyson as a place to work. We are committed to that result. We, this past year, paid all of our team members at end of the year, thank you dollars. And we were happy to do that. Those team members we have are the lifeblood of this company. We don't do anything without them. And so investing in them, taking care of them, keeping them safe is our highest priority.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Zaslow of BMO.\nKenneth Zaslow: So when you talk about the Prepared Foods business, it sounds like there's a lot of internal improvement. How does this margin structure that you've created for this year kind of forecast how you're going to be going forward in 2023 and 2024? Does this give you more confidence? Or are you more tempered because of the inflation? I got a sense of both those sides throughout the conference so far. So I'm just trying to figure out. I would have thought it would have been more bullish longer term, but it sounds like you were tempering it a little bit on the inflation. I'll leave it there for now.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Ken. I'll start off, and then I'll let Noelle, see if she wants to add anything. I think it's important that everyone here -- that we're pricing and trying to get a fair market value for our product in the marketplace. That's one avenue. But secondly, the one that's absolutely in our control is to be able to do what we do better as being best-in-class in operations. That's labor, that's yields, that spend, productivity, running lines at rate. And then let's not forget the fact that a location -- we all have 168 hours in a week. How do we run more hours in a week and get greater asset utilization of the assets that we currently have? And so we're looking at all those things. So I think productivity -- don't think it of it as something to offset inflation. Think of it as a way of life and who we are as a company. And it's the gift that -- part an expression, it's a gift that's going to keep on giving for us, and it will never go out of style for us. So with that, let me pause, and I'll let Noelle add some color to that.\nNoelle O\u2019Mara: Thank you, Donnie, and thanks for the question, Ken. So what we've talked about through Investor Day and as we've come together on these calls, we continue to believe in our confidence that this portfolio is a double-digit ROS business. And the foundations of those building blocks continues to be the same. Demand continues to be strong across retail as well as the expected continued foodservice recovery. As we look holistically, the top line acceleration will come from actions that we're taking to increase capacity both in our existing footprint as well as through expansion in our network, including step-change investments in automation that Donnie referenced. We're also taking significant actions to transform our cost base, and we'll continue navigating the increase of inputs with pricing to offset inflation as necessary. And so you do recognize that there is inflationary dynamics that we're mindful of as well as continuing to keep a very close watch on the elasticities as we go throughout the second half. But as we look holistically in terms of the strength of this business, the demand outlook, coupled with investments across our portfolio, mixed opportunities within the business, which includes organic discriminating investments as well as inorganic portfolio shaping and aggressive cost transformation, we're confident in our path to deliver sustainable double-digit margins. And then for the year, as we referenced, we do expect to be in that 8% to 10% ROS range.\nKenneth Zaslow: Great. I appreciate that. And then my second question is, when you think about the cattle cycle longer term, there seems to be a lot of -- or a fair bit of new capacity announcements over the last 6-or-so months going out 2023, 2024. How do you think about that new capacity versus the cattle supply versus the demand? And how does that impact how you think about margins longer term, not just this year?\nDonnie King: Thank you, Ken. I will start off, and then I will flip it to Shane to add a little extra color. In terms of incremental capacity, competition makes us better. So we're not frightened by that. We welcome that. So -- but in terms of cattle supply, because of the drought and herd liquidation and a number of other things going on, I mean that -- it will have some impact on supply in the cattle out front. In terms of our business, so I think it's really important to understand that a cow is not a cow and the fact that we work with our ranchers and feeders and we buy a premium cattle. And that premium cattle, we pay more for it, but we also get a better cutout before it. And then we talked earlier about specialty products, particularly fast in oils and hides and the like and how that helps that whole cutout value. So we've had some really extraordinary margins over the last couple of years. We don't think that will maintain that level. It was a point in time and a shock to the system. However, we do believe that we will be in that 6% to 8% range on a go-forward basis because of some of those things that I talked about earlier. And with that, Shane, anything I've missed if you'd like to...\nShane Miller: Yes. And thank you for the question. Donnie, you hit on most of it here. I would say a couple of things here, and I mentioned it earlier, that from a kind of genetics perspective and the quality that our feeding partners are bringing to the marketplace today, it's never been better. And the drought conditions that are plaguing, I'd say, over 50%, 55% of the country continue to persist. So you've seen heavy cow liquidation year-to-date that's impacting the forward curve because this is what's going to impact you 2 and 3 years out. And that's due to the lack of grass and forage that's in the country right now. So -- as Donnie mentioned, we expect to see more competition for livestock here as we go forward. We're laser-focused on staffing our plans, building our supply chain, enhancing our relationships, servicing customers and performing with the best. And this is a very competitive industry, and it always has been. But at the end of the day, it's having a diversification of programs and customers. We feel we offer solution to customers through a case-ready business with 2 new plants that have been added here this past year. They're going to lend to our overall success, too. So yes, we're seeing higher prices here from a cattle perspective, and we anticipated that here, and we continue to navigate that. But your point in your question is spot on: there's going to be more competition in the future.\nStewart Glendinning: Ken, Stewart here. Just one thing to add. I mean, I think important to just think about how this impacts the shape of the year. Ken Goldman opened with a question on sequential improvement. That answer I gave him, just so all of you are really clear, related specifically to Chicken. That was Donnie's comment on Chicken -- sequential improvement in Chicken and the guidance that supports that. But my comment on Beef, which ties into your question is that you have to watch Beef in the back part of the year when you start thinking about Tyson as a whole because the first half of the year has been better. It's been a better half of the year, 16% in total. And that's been a great result for us. Of course, the back part of the year, we'll start to see that come off. And in the coming quarters, we'll be able to give you the guidance on the future years. But be clear that we've been consistent in Investor Day and in recent calls in saying that we think that global demand for beef is strong and so long as the cattle are there to supply that. Over the long haul, Beef, we think, will be a better business than it has been historically.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Donnie King for any closing remarks.\nDonnie King: Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking to you again soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stewart Glendinning",
            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial performance. We're pleased to report strong results in the second quarter and first half of this fiscal year. Sales were up in the second quarter and the first half, benefiting from our pricing initiatives to offset inflation as well as improved product and channel mix. Volumes were down slightly through the first half impacted by continued labor challenges and a temporary disruption from the Omicron variant surge. Looking at our sales results by channel. Retail drove $424 million of top line improvement in the second quarter relative to the same quarter last year. Through the first half, retail sales have improved $773 million. In the second quarter, improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $684 million, and domestic export sales to international markets were $311 million stronger than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. Second quarter adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion was up 57% relative to the same quarter last year, led by increases in Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods. First half adjusted operating income of $2.6 billion was up 47%, supported by increases in Beef and Chicken. Driven by the strong increase in operating income, second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.29 grew 71% compared to the same period last year. Second quarter earnings per share also benefited from lower net interest expense and higher other income. Slide 11 bridges year-to-date operating income for the second quarter, which was $422 million higher than fiscal 2021. Volumes were down 1.5% in the second quarter. Volume improvement in Chicken, International/Other and Beef were offset by declines in Pork and Prepared Foods, where continued labor and supply chain challenges impacted throughput. Our pricing mix and portfolio efforts led to higher sales during the quarter, which offset the higher input costs. We saw continued inflation across the business, in some instances, up 25% or more. Notable examples were labor feed ingredients, live cattle, lean hogs and freight costs. SG&A was $46 million unfavorable to the same period last year due to increased team member-related costs and investments in advertising and promotional spend in support of our brands. As a final note, both cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses in the quarter were partially offset by productivity savings.  Moving to the Beef segment on Slide 12. Segment sales were approximately $5 billion for the second quarter, up 24% versus the same period last year. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by continued robust demand for Beef products, which supported higher average sales price and volume. The cutout and our average sales price remained relatively strong during the quarter despite some consumer demand shifting toward lower-cost beef cuts. Quarterly volume improved compared to the prior year despite the Omicron surge experienced by the business. We expect volume to continue to improve in the second half of this fiscal year as new team member recruitment strategies support improved staffing and higher throughput levels. On expenses, we incurred greater costs during the second quarter versus the comparable period a year ago as live capital costs increased approximately $545 million in the quarter. We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by higher herd liquidation due to drought conditions. As of February, 54% of capital inventory were in areas experiencing drought conditions, which may lead to additional herd liquidation through the remainder of the fiscal year. We delivered segment operating income of $638 million in the quarter, up 43% versus the comparable period. This improvement was driven by solid global demand for Beef products, supporting a higher cutout as well as higher specialty product values, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Our operating margin of 12.7% was higher than the same quarter last year but was down on a sequential basis versus the last 2 quarters as cost increases led to a narrowing of the spread.  Looking next at the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 6% versus the same period last year. Average sales price increased 10.8%, but volumes were 4.8% lower relative to the same period last year. Average sales price was up due to higher input costs, while volumes were lower due to labor challenges from the Omicron surge, which led to lower processing throughput. Segment operating income was $59 million for the quarter, down 12% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment declined to 3.8%. The operating income deterioration was driven by softer exports, higher input costs and labor challenges. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were approximately $2.4 billion for the quarter, up 11% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down in the quarter given labor and supply chain challenges and uneven foodservice recovery and the sale of our pet treats business. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by higher average sales price. Consumer demand has remained durable even as we worked to manage inflation through price increase. Overall, consumer response to higher price levels is below historical expectations as our brand strength and category relevance has enabled continuing strong demand. Raw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging and labor all increased our cost of production. To offset higher costs, we have executed productivity, revenue management and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through increased marketing and trade support. Operating margins for the segment were 11% or $263 million for the quarter, up 21% versus the same quarter last year.  Moving on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $4.1 billion for the quarter, up 15%. Volumes improved in the quarter due to strong consumer demand and operational improvements. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes. We expect to deliver further volume improvements in the second half of fiscal 2022 as harvest numbers improve and continue to optimize the operational efficiency of our plants. Average sales price improved 14.4% in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to price recovery offsetting inflationary costs. On pricing, we made meaningful progress to shift our pricing mechanisms toward more variable structures and are now seeing those benefits. We restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal 2021 to be more agile in response to market and inflationary conditions. Chicken delivered adjusted operating income of $203 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22, representing an operating margin of 5%. Operating income increased in the second quarter due to increased sales volume and higher average sales prices, partially offset by the impacts of inflationary market conditions, including increased supply chain costs and a challenging labor environment. In the second quarter of fiscal '22, we experienced $100 million of higher feed ingredient costs and $101 million of net derivative gain as compared to $10 million of net derivative gains in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. During the fiscal month of April, the beginning of our third quarter, we have achieved an approximate 5% operating margin, excluding mark-to-market derivative impacts. Restoring competitiveness in our Chicken business remains a top priority, and we are making progress on achieving our long-term targets for adjusted operating margin, but we still have work to do.  Turning to Slide 16. Our healthy cash flows have continued to support a broad capital allocation approach. We are focused on building financial strength, investing in our team members, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. Consistent with our expectations, our operating cash flows were down slightly in the first half of the year due to planned investment in working capital. And consistent of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we used our existing liquidity to retire $1 billion of debt in the second quarter. Since the start of the pandemic, which this quarter now marks 2 years ago, we have reduced gross debt by approximately $3.8 billion. We maintained our leverage ratio at 1.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our powerful balance sheet and our continued capital allocation optionality. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. This will support strong return on capital generation for our shareholders.  Finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We bought back $175 million of shares at an average price of $88.50 per share during the second quarter. This is in addition to the $348 million of shares repurchased during the first quarter. Let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. Based on the strong first half results, we're raising our total company sales guidance to a range of $52 billion to $54 billion. In support of our sales growth, we now expect 1% to 2% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full.  Looking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments. In Chicken, our operational turnaround is working, and we expect full year margins to be between 5% and 7%. Based on our first half performance, we now expect the full year margin in Prepared Foods to be in the range of 8% to 10%. In Beef, we are raising our AOI margin to 11% to 13%. We still expect the first half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize in the second half. We expect that cattle price increases will reduce the overall margin in the back half. In Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal 2021, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. As is normal seasonality for Pork, we expect the first quarter to be the strongest. In International/Other, we anticipate reduced results from our foreign operations in fiscal '22 due to supply chain disruptions and other impacts related to COVID-19. Our expectations for CapEx, net interest expense and tax rate remain unchanged. Our net leverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality, inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders over the course of the year.  I'll now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&A instructions. Megan? Yes. Let me pick that up for Donnie. This is Stewart. I think you can take it as the first half is going to be not as strong as the second half. We haven't got obviously into giving you quarter-by-quarter. But we expect our business to strengthen over the back half. You'll recall from the prepared remarks that we expect our Beef to start to weaken in the second half. So some of that quarter-by-quarter timing will depend a little bit on the timing update. Yes. Let me -- this is Stewart. Let me go ahead the question on hedging. So we hedge primarily when we are obligated to fixed price, particularly any kind of agreements that are longer term that makes sure that we're not exposed to a fixed price with a moving commodity base. This year, we've seen a shift. We've talked about that in a couple of our calls. We have shifted to more variable or commodity-driven pricing, which means that we don't have to hedge as much. Keep in mind also, though, that those pricing mechanisms will have various triggers, and therefore, they won't be repricing every day. And so you will see us, of course, hedging over the shorter term to make sure that during that kind of lag period where we are obligated to price, that we have got protection from those in grains and other commodities. Is that helpful? Ken, Stewart here. Just one thing to add. I mean, I think important to just think about how this impacts the shape of the year. Ken Goldman opened with a question on sequential improvement. That answer I gave him, just so all of you are really clear, related specifically to Chicken. That was Donnie's comment on Chicken -- sequential improvement in Chicken and the guidance that supports that. But my comment on Beef, which ties into your question is that you have to watch Beef in the back part of the year when you start thinking about Tyson as a whole because the first half of the year has been better. It's been a better half of the year, 16% in total. And that's been a great result for us. Of course, the back part of the year, we'll start to see that come off. And in the coming quarters, we'll be able to give you the guidance on the future years. But be clear that we've been consistent in Investor Day and in recent calls in saying that we think that global demand for beef is strong and so long as the cattle are there to supply that. Over the long haul, Beef, we think, will be a better business than it has been historically."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Donnie, and thanks, Peter, for the question. Donnie, he hit on a couple of the categories. Obviously, specialty products, which is everything that's coming off of the drop or the harvest side of our operations, has improved. We continue to see better value coming from the fasten oil category. But also if you think about areas like proteins, you think about herbs, think about some of the variety meats that are typically sold into the export arena, we're seeing very strong demand globally from the product mix that we're supplying to the marketplace. This is still a cyclical business. We believe over that continuum that beef demand will continue to be very strong from a global perspective. And on top of that, if you think about the value that we're bringing to the marketplace and also to -- ultimately to the consumer, the meat quality and the cattle genetics that are being supplied to us today have never been better. So I think as we look forward here, strong quality, great product mix and diversification of customers and programs will lend to stronger support. Yes. And thank you for the question. Donnie, you hit on most of it here. I would say a couple of things here, and I mentioned it earlier, that from a kind of genetics perspective and the quality that our feeding partners are bringing to the marketplace today, it's never been better. And the drought conditions that are plaguing, I'd say, over 50%, 55% of the country continue to persist. So you've seen heavy cow liquidation year-to-date that's impacting the forward curve because this is what's going to impact you 2 and 3 years out. And that's due to the lack of grass and forage that's in the country right now. So -- as Donnie mentioned, we expect to see more competition for livestock here as we go forward. We're laser-focused on staffing our plans, building our supply chain, enhancing our relationships, servicing customers and performing with the best. And this is a very competitive industry, and it always has been. But at the end of the day, it's having a diversification of programs and customers. We feel we offer solution to customers through a case-ready business with 2 new plants that have been added here this past year. They're going to lend to our overall success, too. So yes, we're seeing higher prices here from a cattle perspective, and we anticipated that here, and we continue to navigate that. But your point in your question is spot on: there's going to be more competition in the future."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call. Earlier today, we reported strong second quarter and first half fiscal year '22 results. Our results would not have been possible without the work of our team members. I'm grateful for their dedication and diligent efforts this quarter as we continue to manage a complex and dynamic operating environment. We delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth driven by strong market fundamentals, acceleration of our productivity actions and improving operational execution across our segments. Our diverse protein portfolio, omnichannel capabilities, leading brands and value-added products all contributed to our results. Strong performance in our Beef segment, continued recovery in Prepared Foods and an improvement in Chicken supported improved sales and earnings. Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, have driven strong share performance in the retail channel since the onset of the pandemic. This quarter, we delivered share gains in bacon, hotdogs and snacking. We also continue to see recovery in the foodservice channel with our relative strength in QSRs and K-12, supporting continued share gains in branded value-added chicken. Overall, consumer demand for protein has remained strong, and we are taking deliberate actions by segment to improve our volumes to better meet customer needs, including investing in new capacity, brands, product innovation and our team member experience. We are seeing our investments in team members making an impact. Despite continued labor challenge during the Omicron surge this quarter, we're seeing lower turnover and absenteeism. We have invested in higher wages, benefits and other workplace enhancements, such as flexible schedules, child care and transportation. The construction of new plants continues to progress. This additional capacity will enable our team to address capacity constraints and better serve growing demand for protein across all segments. Along with ramping up utilization of our newest plant in Humboldt, Eagle Mountain and Thailand, we have 4 plants expected to commence operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. In addition to the new sites, we're continually upgrading capacity as needed with approximately 10 projects planned in the third quarter, representing 25 million pounds of volume in Prepared Foods alone. In addition, we are working closely with our customers to ensure that the fair value of our products incorporates the inflationary cost pressures impacting our business. For the first half, our cost of goods sold rose 15% relative to the same period last year. Every part of our business has been impacted by inflation. We experienced higher costs across our supply chain for all inputs from feed ingredients, live animals and other raw materials to cooking oils and basic supplies. We're also managing higher cost of labor and transportation due to robust demand, higher fuel costs and limited availability. As part of our effort to combat inflation and increase profitability, I'm pleased by our accomplishments to drive costs lower by accelerating our productivity actions. Also, our balance sheet and liquidity position remain healthy, providing optionality to invest in growth across our portfolio and return cash to shareholders. We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on total shareholder return. Our first half results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives and that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins and driving stronger returns for our shareholders.  Now turning to the financial results. Let me give you some highlights. Sales improved 16% in the second quarter and 20% during the first half. Our sales gains were largely driven by higher average sales price and mix improvement. Average sales price trends reflect disciplined revenue management strategies in the context of a volatile, high-inflation environment. Like many other companies, we've seen varying levels of heightened inflation, notably in grains, labor, live animals, raw material and transportation costs. As I mentioned earlier, our teams have worked together with our customers to manage inflationary pressures. We delivered solid operating income performance, up 57% during the second quarter and 47% for the first half. The performance in the first half was due to strength in Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods. Overall, our operating income performance translated to $2.29 in earnings per share for the second quarter, up 71% and $5.16 in earnings per share for the first half of 57%.  Looking at our results on volume. We remain confident that our actions will improve our performance, but we are not where we expect it to be by now as we faced the Omicron surge in the quarter and other labor and supply chain challenges. Due to these factors, our total volume was down slightly for the first half versus last year. Chicken remained a bright spot, where volume was up 2.1% through the first half compared to the same period last year. This improvement was driven by solid fundamental demand as well as operational improvements. There is much more work to be done as we focus on filling our existing capacity. We are pulling multiple levers to drive sequential improvement in our performance. And as a result, I'm confident that we will see continued volume performance in the second half. In Prepared Foods, volumes were down 4% in the first half compared to the same period last year. Approximately 1/3 of this decline was related to the pet treats divestiture with the remainder of the result of a challenging supply environment and uneven recovery of the foodservice channel. We are working to improve these results over the remainder of FY '22 as we continue to take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization. In Beef, volumes were down 2.9% in the first half compared to the same period last year. However, beef volumes increased quarter-over-quarter due to higher harvest weights. We expect continued volume improvements for the remainder of our fiscal year '22 as new team member recruitment strategies support an improved labor position and higher throughput. In Pork, impacts associated with a challenging labor environment contributed to a 2.3% decline in volume in the first half compared to the same period last year. We expect tightness in live hog inventories to affect our second half volume. In International/Other, our investments in capacity, innovation and brands are supporting our market share growth objectives and volume improvement. Overall, we will continue to take actions across our business to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix and align our portfolio with customer and consumer needs. Although we have reduced our expectations for the full year, we still expect to grow our total company volumes in fiscal year '22. We continue to take meaningful action toward becoming the most sought-after place to work, and we're making significant investments to attract and retain team members. Our U.S.-based workforce is comprised of team members from more than 160 countries. In April, we announced that we are investing over $1 million in several non-profit groups to expand legal and citizenship support for the team members aspiring to become U.S. citizens. This will allow us to scale a program from 7 Tyson facilities to serve 40 company locations in 14 states. We recently announced an expansion of the Upward Academy program as our latest investment in our team members. Starting the summer, U.S. team members will have access to free education, including masters, undergraduate and associate degrees, career certificates as well as class in literacy and technology fundamentals. And Tyson will pay 100% of the cost of tuition, books and fees with an estimated investment of $60 million over the next 4 years. Ensuring the health and safety of our global team is a top priority. We continue to challenge ourselves to be an organization that stays ahead of the unforeseen event and adjusting our protocols to keep our team members healthy and safe. We have educated and encouraged team members to get vaccine boosters and have offered over 100 clinics across our office and plant locations.  We are also investing to support team member well-being more proactively in our rural communities. We now have 7 on or near-site Tyson health centers opened and operating. These clinics provide comprehensive health care services, including preventive screenings, chronic condition coaching, mental health counseling, lab services and sick visits at little to no cost to most of our team members or their spouses and dependents. Overall, we're confident that our actions will increase Tyson staff levels and position us for future growth, and we will continue to explore innovative benefit offerings that make our team members' lives better. We're making excellent progress on our productivity program, which will deliver more than $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal year '24. Based on current progress, we now expect to deliver more than $400 million of savings in fiscal year '22, which is on the high end of our previously disclosed range for the year. Last quarter, I highlighted our work in Prepared Foods to build a digital manufacturing platform that utilizes data to simplify complexity and optimize processing. I also shared our work to enhance the mix and allocation of our trucking fleet resources to enable better on-time deliveries to customers. This quarter, deployment of our Tyson production system approach has improved our yield across all segments versus a year ago. Additionally, our procurement program is addressing total company spend, including direct material as well as plant and corporate indirect areas. This program continues to deliver savings in line with expectations. Our digital solutions journey has also progressed. In our supply chain, we are leveraging new processes and digital tools to quickly identify gaps in fulfillment. Meeting the demands of our customers on time and in full is of the utmost priority, and we are continuing to maximize our service levels. The early results of our finance automation and digitization work also remain promising. For example, this program is providing more accurate billing and improved collections for Tyson while lowering our intensive labor. We are also investing aggressively in automation and technology to help address some of our most difficult roles in repetitive tasks. This is a well-planned program of automation to use common designs and equipment across our plants to optimize cost, maintenance and asset utilization. The debone automation program is continuing to scale in plants, and our Tyson proprietary debone automation solution is also beginning to roll out in select facilities. Looking ahead, we're starting to scale new programs like pack-out robotics to continue automating highly manual processes and deliver savings. Chicken remains a top priority, and we continue to execute against our road map to restore top-quartile profitability for this segment. We've been committed to returning our operating margins to 5% to 7% level by the middle of FY '22. This quarter, we delivered a 5% adjusted operating margin, in line with our previously communicated plan. Critical to improving our profitability is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, being staffed to standard and having enough workers to run our plants full. Since September, we have seen an improvement in our hatch rate that is consistent with the expectations that we shared at our December Investor Day. We are committed to growing our harvest capacity utilization, and we outpaced the industry in the second quarter. Achieving improved chicken harvest and higher capacity utilization will allow us to build on the volume growth delivered by Chicken in the first half. In parallel to actions to improve volume, we have also worked with customers to manage inflationary pressures by adjusting pricing to achieve a fair value for our products. This will be important to ensuring we deliver sequential improvement in our operating margins in the second half of fiscal year '22, especially with continued increases in key input costs such as labor and feed ingredients. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are also making good progress on our automation objectives for the segment. This includes the rollout of debone automation and a range of other equipment, which will enhance our productivity and cost effectiveness. We have come a long way in a short period of time, and I'm pleased with the progress we are making in Chicken. To recap, we have strong consumer demand, a powerful and diverse portfolio across geographies and channels and a team that is positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. 5 imperatives on this slide show how we will achieve our commitments and drive value creation for our shareholders. This starts first with our commitment to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as well as investing in improving our team member experience.  Second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better address demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales. As a result, we expect our volume to outpace overall market growth over the next several years.  Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment and continue to achieve key milestones on our road map to top-quartile profitability.  Fourth, we are driving operational and functional excellence in investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our productivity program, where we are accelerating our efforts and now expect to deliver more than $400 million in savings this year.  Fifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we're using our financial strength to invest in our business. We're on track to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. We also continue to return cash to shareholders. Through the first half, we returned approximately $850 million in dividends and share repurchases.  As a final comment before turning the call over to Stewart, I want to highlight that Tyson Foods understands we have a critical role to play in the global food system to make it more resilient, more sustainable and more equitable for current and future generations. Just recently, we completed a materiality analysis that will inform our long-range strategy. These insights from key stakeholders shape our strategic framework and provide direction on the expectations of our company. I will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through more detail on the financial results for the second quarter. Thanks, Ken. This is Donnie. We expect it to -- in fact, we thought we would have already seen lower supply than what we are seeing right now. An interesting data point is that cattle and feed recorded over 12 million, had a record high from March 1. So there's a little bit of noise in that still. Drought conditions and grain costs are certainly impacting supply. But we -- as we said, we think in the back half of the year, we'll see the spread tighten in our Beef business. And -- but I would also point out that we think it will be much higher. In fact, we call it 6% to 8% on a normalized range these days. But it's holding up pretty good right now. And while we're -- it's not going to be a record back half, we think it will be a very good one. Thanks, Adam. Let me say a few words, and I'll flip it to David Bray to add a few details. It was a year ago this quarter that I talked about the turnaround in Chicken, and in fact, talked about being at a 5% to 7% business. I will tell you, in this quarter, January, from a Omicron resurgence was painful across all of our businesses. But we've improved sequentially throughout the quarter. The back half of the year, in Chicken specifically, the thing that we need is greater volume, greater efficiency from the assets that we currently have. And we've announced a further processing plant that will come online next year that will add some incremental capacity. But our productivity program is working. We are becoming more efficient, and our volume is growing. And I would expect you to see that to continue to grow and develop over the balance of the year. I would tell you, in short, we're on point. And let me put it to David, and he can add. If I could -- David, if I could add one more thing, Adam. On Friday, we closed on April -- by the way, it was a 5-day close, which is a new record, thanks to Stewart and Philip Thomas and the team. But in Chicken specifically, April was a good month. And Stewart referenced in his prepared remarks around 5%. I can tell you from the close that it's better than 5%. So I'll leave it at that. Thanks, Adam. I will tell you, we started over a year ago with 4 -- with what we call our 4 pillars, of which we're staffing our plant, servicing our customers, growing our business, and we're restoring industry-leading operating performance. That's still our plan. As you well know, there are a number of variables going on right now in the poultry business. What I can tell you is volume -- is demand is strong. In fact, I would tell you that if you look at the price of boneless scales breast meat, I think Friday was somewhere around $3.60. It's been a long time since I've seen that kind of strength in breast meat and chicken overall. And so grain is higher, of course. We are seeing that. Dave and his team are responding with shorter-term contracts to try to protect Tyson and try to protect our customers as well. And I'll stop -- put it over to David, if there's anything other things he'd like to add. David? Thank you, Ben. Let me hit a couple of points, and I'll flip it over to Noelle, and she can go into greater detail with you. And you saw in our statement, the first half was down. We had lower production throughput. Again, January was troubling with the Omicron resurgence, challenging labor. And we did have the sale of pet treats in the quarter -- or in the first half. We expect the volume to improve. Retail demand remained strong, and we had some uneven recovery in our foodservice business, meaning there are some spots, and I'll call them out specifically, and then I'll flip it to Noelle. In our pizza topping business, for example, it was softer than expected. Our Philly business was softer than expected, and our tortilla business was softer than projected. And with that, I'll flip it over to Noelle, and she can talk about the elasticities. Peter, I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll pick it to Shane to make a couple. In our Q2, sales volume did increase. We had improved staffing and higher harvest weight. We talked a lot about the fact that we're buying a higher grade of animal, the process. Grades have improved significantly through the last couple of decades, and that continues to be the case for us. But as you pointed out, we're seeing a lot of help from our specialty products group, particularly in the fat and tallow area, our relationship with Jacobs Stearns that we've had there, we're able to take a lot of that product. And with the price of diesel and fuels, we're able to now to get some really bring value out of those products, and that's providing some tailwinds for us in our Beef business. But I'll flip it to Shane, and he can add a little bit more color to that. Sure. There's a number of things going on there. We had the -- our hatch has improved. We're better than the average of the industry, for example, today. A year ago, we could not say that. So we have seen improvement there. We have also reduced our outside purchase of meat, and that's had a pretty significant impact on our overall volume, in Chicken specifically. We also -- if you'll recall, we had a fire in Huntsville, Alabama that impacted our volume. Not only of the rendered product that we produce ourselves, but on the ability to go buy that on the outside, that had a pretty significant impact as well. So those are kind of the top line things relative to volume. What I will tell you is we grew in the quarter. We grew in the first half. We didn't grow at the rate which we said -- and if you'll recall, we were -- we wanted to grow faster than the market, which we did but not where we want to be in terms of overall volume. And I'll let David touch on some of that. Sure. Thank you. So in terms of productivity, I'll just start out by reminding what we said in our Investor Day. We said that from an operational and functional excellence perspective between now and '24, we would save $300-plus million. From a digital -- making -- applying digital throughout our supply chain was worth another $250 million, and automation was $450 million. What I can tell you to date is that we will deliver near $400 million in year 1. And each and every day, we identify new things that we can put on our tracker that will deliver better results. But I would want you to take away from this is that there's unprecedented inflation, inflation we haven't seen in generation, really. And so this is not just pricing for inflation. We're also doing everything we know to do to become more productive, a more efficient, a lower-cost producer. And as we say in our poultry business, we want to be top quartile or better in every place that we play, and we still got room to do that. So I'd tell you that we're on track. There are things like trucking fleet resources and optimization, we -- our procurement program to address total company spend and then gas and fulfillment. The debone automation projects that we have in poultry, they're progressing as planned. In fact, they're a little ahead of that. And so we feel good about that. But our future is going to -- one, we have a fair market value price in the marketplace; but two, we want to be among the very best in every place that we participate. Thank you for that question. And I'll hit on a few points. For example, we realize -- fully realize that we have to create a desirable place to work. In fact, we talked about it in terms of being the most sought-after place to work. We realized that those team members that we have can work wherever they choose to work. And we want to give them a reason to work for us. I believe I said in the last call, it is not my objective to fix the labor problem in the United States. My objective is to fix the labor issues that we have at Tyson Foods, and we're doing that. And it's not a -- there's not a one thing that fits all the needs. For example, child care, you can talk about child care, and there's a subset of the population that, that is of value. And -- but there's also other areas where it's not. Transportation is more desired and needed in other areas. We have, in some rural communities, for example, the need for healthcare. So we created on-site or near-site health clinics that our team members and their families have access to little or no cost. And that's one opportunity for us to have a differentiated place to work. It's true, we continue to invest in wages and benefits in booster shots and booster clinics. We've done over 100 of those. And we think we're seeing a positive impact from those things. We're seeing improved absenteeism and turnover rates. We announced that we're going to support team members through non-profits to try to for legal citizenship support. And then 2 weeks ago, I think it was, we announced Upward Academy program. And we're going to spend $60 million over the next 4 years for education for our team members. That's master's degree, bachelor's degree, associate's degrees, live skills training, English, for example, whatever we can do to try to differentiate Tyson as a place to work. We are committed to that result. We, this past year, paid all of our team members at end of the year, thank you dollars. And we were happy to do that. Those team members we have are the lifeblood of this company. We don't do anything without them. And so investing in them, taking care of them, keeping them safe is our highest priority. Thanks, Ken. I'll start off, and then I'll let Noelle, see if she wants to add anything. I think it's important that everyone here -- that we're pricing and trying to get a fair market value for our product in the marketplace. That's one avenue. But secondly, the one that's absolutely in our control is to be able to do what we do better as being best-in-class in operations. That's labor, that's yields, that spend, productivity, running lines at rate. And then let's not forget the fact that a location -- we all have 168 hours in a week. How do we run more hours in a week and get greater asset utilization of the assets that we currently have? And so we're looking at all those things. So I think productivity -- don't think it of it as something to offset inflation. Think of it as a way of life and who we are as a company. And it's the gift that -- part an expression, it's a gift that's going to keep on giving for us, and it will never go out of style for us. So with that, let me pause, and I'll let Noelle add some color to that. Thank you, Ken. I will start off, and then I will flip it to Shane to add a little extra color. In terms of incremental capacity, competition makes us better. So we're not frightened by that. We welcome that. So -- but in terms of cattle supply, because of the drought and herd liquidation and a number of other things going on, I mean that -- it will have some impact on supply in the cattle out front. In terms of our business, so I think it's really important to understand that a cow is not a cow and the fact that we work with our ranchers and feeders and we buy a premium cattle. And that premium cattle, we pay more for it, but we also get a better cutout before it. And then we talked earlier about specialty products, particularly fast in oils and hides and the like and how that helps that whole cutout value. So we've had some really extraordinary margins over the last couple of years. We don't think that will maintain that level. It was a point in time and a shock to the system. However, we do believe that we will be in that 6% to 8% range on a go-forward basis because of some of those things that I talked about earlier. And with that, Shane, anything I've missed if you'd like to... Thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking to you again soon."

            "name": "David Bray",
            "content": "Adam, thank you for the question. I think, first and foremost, what I do want you to hear is that we have made progress within the Chicken segment. But we also know that we have much, much more work to do, and we're focused against that. I would also tell you that we said that we would deliver sequential improvement throughout the fiscal year, and we have. We also shared that we would see improved volumes sequentially. And quarter-over-quarter, we have seen improved volume. And we also said that we would outpace the market for growth. And within the Q2 time frame, we did that as well. In Q2, our harvest head was up 2.9%, and our harvest volume was up 4.9%, which actually allowed pricing to gain share in the Q2 time frame of about 0.75 point. We've also improved our adjusted operating income and our AOI margins sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and this was the case whether we include or exclude any impacts of derivatives against our business. And so again, I would tell you, we're making progress. We have more work to do. We are focused, and our goal has not changed: to be the best chicken company as we focus on the levers of our business. We're continuing to work hard to staff our plants. And today, I would tell you the poultry segment is staffed to standard. We're continuing to work on servicing our customers growing our business and to drive overall operational improvements. Yes, I think just from the grain standpoint, despite what we're seeing from volatility in grain, the turnaround in Chicken is progressing as planned. And again, a large part of that is based off of our variable pricing structures. We're able to move much faster than we have in the past, and that's been a big benefit to us. Relative to avian influenza hub, yes, we are watching that closely, and it is always a risk within this business. But I would tell you that we mitigate that risk through the use of our biosecurity measures and that they are in place across all of our facilities right now. This includes testing every block that we have for AI before it leaves the farm. We are operating under heightened measures in some geographic areas of the country right now, and the heightened measures would basically be we're limiting the amount of people and trips that are taken to our farms as well as making sure that the people that do go to the farms are in clean vehicles, and we will continue to monitor that. To that, I would tell you that any bird loss related to disease impacts our growers, and it impacts our plants as well, but these have been relatively minimal to our business to date. Yes. I think one other comment to that is we have seen several weeks, 5 weeks, of continuous improvement within our live operations. And one big component of what's going to continue to improve for us is we are on track with the delivery of the new male into all of our farms. And so we feel very optimistic about that. It's a male that we know very well. With that, we will continue to see improved hatch rates within our facilities as well as improved weight gain across with the new male coming in."
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Noelle O'Mara",
            "content": "Thanks, Donnie. So as Donnie referenced, demand really does continue to be strong driven by our strong brand equities and our diverse portfolio. And we do see that demand continues to exceed supply in a majority of our categories. We've made significant improvements in our labor vacancy rates. We expect to be back to prepandemic levels. In the second half, we also have investments coming online that we referenced in the prepared remarks on capacity. As Donnie referenced in foodservice, we are seeing a bit of uneven recovery. Overall, I would say it's showing momentum. Where we did see impacts is in January and February, where the Omicron variant surge had a brief negative impact as consumer mobility waned and foodservice traffic declined. This, along with some of the other dynamics from a labor perspective in the industry, slow recovery at the beginning of the year. But as we look at March traffic, the data shows that we are returning to pre-Omicron recovery levels as COVID cases drop back to a bit more normative levels. But broadly speaking, QSRs and stores continue to lead the recovery relative to other channels. We're also seeing great momentum in K-12 and continue to be optimistic in the overall recovery. And as referenced, we continue to make significant impacts on cost transformation. And so you'll continue to see a focus on that holistically for us across the business as we continue to improve labor, as we continue to expand our capacity, as we continue to invest in our portfolio and our leading brands and expect to deliver 8% to 10% ROS for the year. So what I'd start by saying is, to your point, and you've heard this in the prepared remarks and Stewart emphasized as well that we had a better-than-expected first half really driven by the actions that we took on price to offset inflationary impacts, the improvements that we saw in labor, the cost transformation starting to come through as well as mix. As I referenced a few minutes ago, the demand expectations that we see continues to outpace supply. And with labor momentum and the capacity investments, we do expect volume improvements as we continue through the second half. We also anticipate continued foodservice recovery. As we look towards the back half on the inflationary side, we do continue to expect inflationary pressures through the back half, which is why it's sort of top of mind on the cost transformation efforts that Donnie just referenced. And so holistically, we're confident about the 8% to 10% ROS range. Thank you, Donnie, and thanks for the question, Ken. So what we've talked about through Investor Day and as we've come together on these calls, we continue to believe in our confidence that this portfolio is a double-digit ROS business. And the foundations of those building blocks continues to be the same. Demand continues to be strong across retail as well as the expected continued foodservice recovery. As we look holistically, the top line acceleration will come from actions that we're taking to increase capacity both in our existing footprint as well as through expansion in our network, including step-change investments in automation that Donnie referenced. We're also taking significant actions to transform our cost base, and we'll continue navigating the increase of inputs with pricing to offset inflation as necessary. And so you do recognize that there is inflationary dynamics that we're mindful of as well as continuing to keep a very close watch on the elasticities as we go throughout the second half. But as we look holistically in terms of the strength of this business, the demand outlook, coupled with investments across our portfolio, mixed opportunities within the business, which includes organic discriminating investments as well as inorganic portfolio shaping and aggressive cost transformation, we're confident in our path to deliver sustainable double-digit margins. And then for the year, as we referenced, we do expect to be in that 8% to 10% ROS range."

I'll now turn the call over to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thank you, Megan, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call today. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter fiscal 2022 results. Tyson Foods once again delivered strong financial results. I would like to start by thanking our team members for their dedication, Herculean efforts this quarter as we managed a complex and dynamic operating environment. At our Investor Day, I shared our plan to grow our top and bottom lines aggressively over the next 3 years. This meant EPS growth of high single digits relative to a 2019 baseline and volume growth ahead of the market. Our results this quarter put us firmly on that path. We achieved double-digit sales and earnings growth, both of which were driven by ongoing demand strength, productivity savings and improving execution across our segments. Our diverse protein portfolio, omnichannel capabilities, leading brands and value-added products contributed to our results. Strong performance in our Beef segment, earlier-than-expected recovery in Prepared Foods and improvement in Chicken and Pork, all supported strong earning results. Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park maintain their volume share position even as we work through price increases to address inflationary pressure. And our foodservice focused 6 product lines grew share year-over-year in broadline distribution. This growth was driven in large part by value-added chicken, which outperformed industry recovery and breakfast sausage where we were seeing improved fill rates. Importantly, and despite the continued impact of COVID-19, our volumes improved slightly across the company relative to the same quarter last year. Chicken was a bright spot, where we saw our volumes improved 3.6%. While this is a good start, we are not where we want to be on volume. So we're taking actions segment by segment to improve our volume performance. These actions include investing in our team members, in additional capacity and in brands and product innovation. As discussed at Investor Day, we are also in the process of building 12 new plants. Each of these is progressing and each will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and meet the growing global demand for protein. Bottom line, we're committed to improving our total company volumes during the year. We're also making sure that our pricing incorporates inflationary cost pressures on our business. In the quarter, our cost of goods sold was up 18% relative to the same period last year. We are seeing higher costs across our supply chain, including higher input costs, such as feed and ingredients. We're also managing higher cost of labor, transportation due to strong demand and limited availability. With these higher costs, we work closely with our customers to achieve a fair value for our products. As a result, our average sales price for the quarter increased 19.6% relative to the same period last year. This helped us capture some of the unrecovered costs due to the timing lag between inflation and price. Finally, our balance sheet and overall liquidity position are strong, providing optionality to pursue strategic growth priorities and invest in growth across our portfolio. We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital to support capacity expansion while achieving improved returns on invested capital. Our first quarter results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives, that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders. While we're growing our business, we are mindful of our corporate responsibilities around environment, social and governance goals. For example, we committed to investing in and supporting our communities in rural America and around the world. Last year, Tyson Foods donated more than 16 million pounds of protein, the equivalent of 64 million meals to fight hunger. We're incredibly proud of this work and the people that make it possible. Tyson is a great company with a great team doing great things, and I'm pleased that this was recognized just last week by Fortune Magazine, who announced that for the sixth year in a row, Tyson Foods was #1 in our sector in their rankings of the world's most admired companies. Now let's look at a few financial highlights from the first quarter. Our results included double-digit top and bottom line growth. We delivered solid operating income performance, up 40% for the quarter. This performance was broad-based across segments where continued strong consumer demand and effective pricing to mitigate the impact of inflation drove higher earnings. On volume, we are up slightly. And while we're working to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and the ability to achieve optimal mix across our network. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, our volume performance is outpacing our peer set. In retail, despite substantial market pressures, core business lines held share in the first quarter, led by strong performance in lunch meat, hotdogs, snacking and bacon. We also realized strong e-commerce results with Tyson Foods outpacing total food and beverage growth and our core lines gaining share in the quarter. Still, customer demand continues to outpace our ability to supply products. So we have targeted actions in each segment to improve volumes. This is key to delivering on our commitments. To realize our volume goals, we must be able to fully staff our plants across the company. We continue to take meaningful action toward becoming the most sought after place to work. For example, we provided our hourly team members with more than $50 million in bonuses during the first quarter. We are piloting subsidized and on-site childcare and we are adjusting schedules to flex with workforce needs. These actions are bearing fruit as we see some improvement on the labor front. And while we have seen some labor challenges during the Omicron surge, we are generally seeing lower turnover in absenteeism. We saw Chicken volumes grow 3.6% in the quarter, driven by strong fundamental demand and improved live production. What is important to note is that we grew ahead of the market and gained market share. In Prepared Foods, volumes were down 2.6% in the first quarter. About half of the decline was related to Pet Treats divestiture. We expect to sequentially improve these results over the remainder of fiscal year '22 as we take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization. In Beef, volumes were down 6.2%, driven by labor shortages previously mentioned. In addition, port congestion has also dipped in export volumes in the segment. We expect these headwinds on volume to normalize over the course of fiscal 2022. In Pork, we have sequentially improved our capacity utilization. We are still working to optimize the mix. In International/Other, while we are starting from a relatively small base, our investment in capacity, innovation and brands are supporting our market share growth objective. Overall, we expect to grow our total company volumes by 2% to 3% in FY '22, outpacing protein consumption growth. Chicken remains a top priority and we continue to execute against our road map to achieve an operating income margin of 5% to 7% on a run rate basis by mid fiscal '22. I remain confident we will meet this goal. In the first quarter, we've started to see profitability improvement resulting from our actions. For example, we're investing aggressively in automation and technology to help us address some of the most hard to fill roles. This is not a series of projects, but is a well-planned program with automation, designed to use common designs and equipment across our plants to optimize cost, maintenance and asset utilization. The second imperative is to improve operational performance and critical to improving performance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage which means having enough birds to run our plants full. Since September, we've seen an improvement in our hatch rate ahead of our expectations. We continue to expect full recovery in this year. We were pleased with our volume growth in the quarter and expect further improvements as we grow our harvest capacity utilization from an average of 37 million head per week in FY '21 to 40 million head per week by year-end. We've noted previously that strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products put our buy versus grow program at a relative disadvantage. We have reduced our reliance on outside meat accordingly. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our volumes and be the best in the business. The plan we have continues to be the right plan and our commitment to winning with our team members, winning with our customers and consumers and winning with operational excellence is delivering results. Last year, we announced the launch of a new productivity program designed to drive a better, faster, more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The program aims to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline and has 3 critical focus areas, which are operational and functional excellence, digital solutions and automation. We're making some good progress on this front. I spoke just a minute ago about our investments in automation, but we've also attacked other issues. In Prepared Foods, we're making use of supply chain, digitization and advanced analytics. Our digital manufacturing platform allows us to analyze real-time data to take actions to optimize process conditions that drive better yields, lower costs, consistent quality and increased output. In transportation and logistics, we have established ongoing optimization of the mix and allocation of our private fleet, dedicated fleet and third-party fleet, mitigating inflationary pressures and supporting better on-time deliveries to our customers. In addition, we continued the expansion of our direct shipment program, reducing miles driven and product touches in our supply chain. As a result of projects like these, we're on track to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings in fiscal 2022. We shared at our Investor Day that we are taking actions to accelerate our growth and drive disciplined return on invested capital. The 5 imperatives on this slide show how we will achieve our commitments and drive value creation. This starts first with our commitment to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment. We are proud of our COVID-19 vaccine policy implemented last year in the U.S. and of the broader investments that we have made to keep our team members, their families and our communities safe. Because of our policy, our team members are better protected and the cases we do see have been mild or asymptomatic, resulting in an extremely low number of hospitalizations. We are strongly encouraging boosters and are hosting clinics to make it easier for our team members and their families to get boosted. Second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better address demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales. As a result, we expect our volume to outpace this growing market. Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment. This starts by returning our operating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022. Fourth, we're driving operational and functional excellence and investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our new productivity program. We're working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization. Fifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we are using our financial strength to invest in our business. On capital alone, we're expected to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned over $500 million in dividends and share repurchases. To wrap it up, we are committed to winning with our team members, customers and consumers as well as winning with operational excellence. I'm more excited about the future of Tyson Foods with each passing day. And I will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail.\nStewart Glendinning: Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. We're pleased to report a strong overall start to the year. Our sales were up approximately 24% in the first quarter, largely a function of our pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures. Volumes were also up slightly, although impacted by continued labor challenges. Looking at our sales results by channel, retail drove almost $350 million of top line improvements versus last year. Improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $1 billion and our export sales were nearly $333 million stronger than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. First quarter operating income of $1.4 billion was up 40% relative to the same quarter last year due to increased earnings in Beef, Pork and Chicken. Driven by the strength in operating income, first quarter earnings per share grew 48% to $2.87. Higher operating income led to higher adjusted earnings per share compared to the same period last year. And first quarter EPS also benefited from lower interest expense and taxes. Slide 10 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was $407 million higher than fiscal 2021. Volumes were up slightly during the year, primarily a result of improvement in Chicken, Pork and International/Other, offset by declines in Beef and Prepared Foods. Declines in Beef and Prepared Foods were largely due to continued labor challenges in those segments. Our pricing actions led to approximately $2.1 billion in sales and price/mix benefit during the quarter, which offset the higher cost of goods sold of $1.6 billion. We saw continued inflation across the business, in some instances, up 20% to 30%. Notable examples were labor, grain costs, live cattle and hog costs and freight costs. And finally, SG&A was $88 million unfavorable to the same period last year, which was largely a result of cycling a $55 million benefit recorded last year for the recovery of cattle. Moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were more than $5 billion for the quarter, up 25% versus the same period last year. Sales growth was driven by continued strong demand for beef products, which has supported higher average sales price. Partially offsetting higher sales prices were higher capital costs during the first quarter versus the comparable prior year period. We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. We have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal year 2022 and continue to expect it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs. We delivered segment operating income of $956 million, up 81% versus the prior comparable period. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cut out, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Our operating margin of 19.1% was notably higher than the same quarter last year but was down on a sequential basis versus the last 2 quarters as cost increases led to a narrowing of the spread. Now let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 12. Segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 13% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased 12.8% and volumes were slightly higher relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $164 million for the quarter, up 41% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment improved to 10.1% for the quarter. The operating income improvement was driven by higher spreads in the business. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 10% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice more than offset by labor and supply chain challenges. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by inflation-justified pricing. During the quarter, retail core business mines maintained share, driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong execution by our team. Operating margins for the segment were 8% or $186 million for the first quarter. The decline in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw material and other input costs that we were recover cost increases during fiscal 2022. In addition to pricing, we've executed productivity, revenue management and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. Moving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.9 billion for the quarter, up 37%. Volumes improved 3.6% in the quarter due to strong consumer demand and increased life production. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal 2022 as hatch recovers, and we continue to look for ways to operate our plant more efficiently. Average sales price improved around 20% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation. On pricing, we made tremendous progress toward driving our pricing mechanisms toward more variable structures and are now seeing those benefits. We restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal 2021 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions. Chicken delivered adjusted operating income of $117 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing an operating margin of 3%. Operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $185 million of higher feed ingredient costs. Now turning to Slide 15. As part of our capital allocation approach, we focused on building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we used improved earnings to retire debt in fiscal year 2021 and expect to do the same this year. Continued strength in our earnings this quarter have further improved our leverage ratio to 1.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. This will support strong return generation for our shareholders. Finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We finished the quarter with a powerful balance sheet and continued capital allocation optionality. Let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. We are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $49 billion to $51 billion, although we expect to perform at the upper end of the range. In support of our sales growth, we still expect a 2% to 3% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full. Looking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments, in Chicken, our operational turnaround is working and we still expect to achieve a run rate profitability of 5% to 7% by the middle of the year. We expect full year margins that also fall between 5% to 7%. Prepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%. Based on our first quarter performance, we now expect the full year margin performance in Prepared Foods to be at the upper end of the range. In Beef, we are maintaining our AOI margin at 9% to 11%, but we expect to perform at the upper end of the range. Also, we expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year. In Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. As is normal seasonality for pork, we expect the first quarter to be the strongest. In International/Other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability. Consistent with our expectation for a meaningful increase in CapEx spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles, we anticipate CapEx spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal 2022. We now expect lower net interest expense due to lower anticipated average debt balances during the fiscal year. Our expectations for productivity savings and tax rate changes remain unchanged. Our net leverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders over the course of the year. In summary, we've had a strong start to the fiscal year. We have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity and the differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. We set out ambitious calls at our Investor Day, and we expect to achieve them.  I'll now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&A instructions. Megan?\nMegan Britt: Thanks, Stewart. We'll now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: So I guess my first question, just maybe taking the quarter and the kind of updated kind of view of fiscal '22 kind of broadly. Can you help us frame kind of the areas where the margin expectations for the year have maybe incrementally inched up on a point estimate basis and some of the drivers? Is that really reflecting the strong fiscal first quarter? Is that a more constructive view of pricing and price cost balance over the balance of the year? Just help us think about how your outlook has evolved relative to what you give -- given initially in November.\nDonnie King: Well, let me start off with and tell you that we really got off to a good start in Q1. And there are a number of factors with Q1 and what we saw in Q1 and our optimism as we look to the balance of the year. We've adjusted a number of pricing mechanisms to be more variable in nature. We've seen prior elasticities, for example, in Prepared Foods being less or lower than what they have historically been, which is exciting there. We've been able to maintain volume in this inflationary environment. Inflation, as we see it will continue -- is continuing to move up. We're really excited about our productivity program relative to the whole company. We're anticipating $300 million, $400 million, and we're on track through Q1 relative to that. Just doing what we do better and we talk about becoming a more agile, faster decision-making organization. Essentially, that's all about process and being better, faster and making decision that with greater speed at lower levels within the organization. But because of our vaccination position, we've now moved past the surge of the Omicron spike, as we call it, which occurred predominantly in the first 3 weeks of January, and we're back to normal levels. We think our vaccine mandate served us well and making that commitment and really making our team members' health and safety and their families and communities our highest priority has served us through the new variant. We've seen better absenteeism and turnover throughout the organization. We think labor will be available, will be much greater in the balance of the year. And we certainly have capacities coming online with head and harvest and Chicken and further processing capabilities, value-added capabilities in Prepared and Chicken. And we've got labor going back into beef and pork plants, and we'll be able to improve those mixes as well as increase the harvest capacity.\nAdam Samuelson: All right. All right. That color is really helpful. And I guess just a quick follow-up. On capital allocation, you stepped up the buyback in the fiscal first quarter. It was something that was notably absent from the kind of multiyear view at the Analyst Day in December. And I was wondering if you could just help us think, Stewart, maybe just cadence on buybacks going forward? Should we think about it being more ratable, more opportunistic? Just certainly have the balance sheet capacity to make it more ratable, but I'm just trying to think about how to bring that expectation going forward.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Look, thanks for that, Adam. If you go back to Investor Day, we were really focused on being able to point to the strong growth story that sits in front of our Tyson's future. And part of that was a pretty significant allocation of increased capital to CapEx spending and various capacity expansion. So it was an intention to leave stock buyback to the end, but stock buybacks have been talked about in history, and they will be in the future. The one thing we've said is that we do look each year to try to buy back the dilution. And after that, it will be more opportunistic. But growth is a focus for our company.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America.\nPeter Galbo: I guess first question for Donnie. And I believe David is on the line as well. Donnie, you've spoken in the past, and it's been helpful just on how buy versus grow gets put at a disadvantage, particularly when spot prices move, you've made some strides to lower kind of at meat purchases here on a sequential basis. But just in the month of January with where spot prices kind of moved, how should we think about that impact on Chicken and on the overall turnaround maybe just in the short term here?\nDonnie King: Okay, Peter, I'll tell you. I'll start, and then I will let David make a few comments. But over the last year or so, we've been -- the recovery for our Chicken business has been a priority. Specifically, as it relates to buy versus grow, the fact of the matter is, we became too dependent on the buy portion of the model. And we forgot to grow Chicken, which hurt us from a capacity utilization perspective and those additional pounds flowing through our business really impacted our fixed cost leverage. So we tilted too far on the buy portion of this. And over the last year, as we been building the breeding stock and getting past the hatch issue that we talked about so much last year, we're now in a better position to get more head through our processing and harvest facilities and which will give us more breast meat at a much more attractive price point versus the buy in the marketplace right now. We have not totally abandoned the buy portion and do not anticipate totally abandoning that, but there's a smaller percentage of our overall needs that we will go to the market to secure. But we're on plan with what we intended to do. And with that, David, why don't you add a little bit.\nDavid Bray: Yes. I think -- Peter, thank you for the question. I think one way also look at this is we will buy outside meat to the extent it is the right financial decision. From our standpoint, we will continue to manage against what is right, as whether buy versus grow. But generally, outside meat purchases are going to be used to supplement what we're doing when it's the right financial decision. And as what Donnie -- as Donnie stated, volume is critical. It's one of the big levers of what we are going to accomplish in FY '22 to grow the animals ourselves into processes, and that will make us much more efficient.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Okay. And Donnie, in both your comments, prepared remarks and Stewart, you both commented on restructuring the pricing strategy to be more variable in nature, particularly in Chicken. I'm just curious, what percentage of that business now is tied to more of the spot market versus kind of where you had been historically? I think that would be just helpful for us as we think about how to think about the new business going forward.\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. So I would tell you, within Chicken specifically, I would tell you, we have restructured our pricing approach, and that's really in large part, thanks to our commercial organization as well as the great customer relationships that we have across both our retail and food service networks. I would tell you today, we are significantly more variable pricing versus fixed. And again, we're not even utilizing fixed rate within our conversations. Every contractor program that we have is either tied to grain, tied to market value and we will continue to use that. Pricing was up significantly in Chicken in the Q1 time frame of over 20%, and a large part of that was because of the variable programs that we put in place.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.\nKenneth Goldman: I wanted to ask, it's obviously extremely early and this could lead to nothing, but there have been a couple of cases of avian influenza, obviously not in the poultry industry. I'm just curious, are you seeing anything? Are you doing anything on your part to take extra precautions against this? I think you're probably one of the most up-to-speed companies in the world in terms of already taking those precautions. So maybe you're already there. I'm just trying to get a sense of what you see the industry doing and if there's been a lot of changes since the last time title came around.\nDavid Bray: Yes, absolutely. Ken, good morning. Thank you. And yes, the USDA has reported that this high patent variant has only been found in the wild bird population. And it's really been within the East Coast of the United States. I would tell you more specifically to what Tyson is doing versus what the industry is doing is, but we have a very robust biosecurity measures in place across all of our facilities, and that includes testing every flock for avian influenza. In addition, at Tyson, we have heightened our biosecurity measures in all of our facilities on the East Coast. Some of those things that we've done are we're reducing number of trips that we're taking to farms. We're actually taking extra time and doing more cleaning of our vehicles that do go to the farms, but we are ahead of this and have been watching it very closely.\nDonnie King: I would add to this that we are -- we have in our biosecurity programs, we have green, which is just normal business; yellow, orange and red, which are progressive. On the East Coast, as Dave mentioned, we are in the orange category at this point. So a lot of attention and a lot of watching. I saw the case over the weekend in Florida, which I think now is 5 states, which we have seen avian influenza.\nKenneth Goldman: Okay. That is helpful. And then I wanted to also ask, you had you obviously still have a plant-based alternative business, not obviously, the biggest part of your business at this point. But it was a little bit of an initiative for you a couple of years ago and still mentioned from time to time. We've heard some of your competitors and peers out there talk about how demand has slowed for that part of the business. I'm just curious what your take is on the industry in general, how much of -- has your optimism waned at all for that? Just want to get a sense for how you see that current balance between animal-based and alternative-based need.\nDonnie King: Sure. Well, I mean, we're still in the plant-based protein business. We still like it. Consumer demand continues to be good. We've seen a lot more growth late. But across retail and foodservice, we continue to see growth. Now that's off a very small base, as you might imagine. But we're continuing to see growth. But for us, with our presence outside the United States, in Europe and China, and also in Southeast Asia, we also have plant-based products in those markets that are doing really, really well also. So we're still excited about the plant-based business and when consumers prefer that, we want to have the opportunity to be able to provide that for them and are currently and are growing. And let me ask Noelle if there's anything she'd like to add to that.\nNoelle O'Mara: Sure. Just as a build, we want to be leaders across all the proteins that consumers seek. And we know that consumer interest in adoption is growing in this space. And we'll continue to be guided by the consumer needs and the opportunities and -- you see the Raised & Rooted products that we've launched domestically. We continue to have opportunities internationally, and we'll continue to ensure that we are participating with consumer interest and adoption growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays.\nAntonio Hernandez: This is Antonio Hernandez on behalf of Ben Theurer. My question is regarding Prepared Foods, and you basically performed in line with guidance during this last quarter. I think you mentioned over the long-term target of 10% to 12%. How do you see the potential in the purpose to follow pricing to recover margins within this year and also next fiscal year?\nNoelle O'Mara: I can give you a bit of context to what we're currently seeing. So demand continues to be strong across both retail and foodservice driven by our strong equities in our diverse portfolio. And as you said, we're pleased with the market performance that we're seeing despite the price increases, which is really due to the strength of our brands and the strong partnership and relationships that we've built with our customers. Elasticity has been less than the historical models that Donnie has mentioned, but it's clearly something that we're watching closely. And so we're constantly reviewing our pricing and revenue management strategies. As the landscape changes, we'll continue to take thoughtful approaches on those critical levers. As you also heard in the comments, we're taking significant actions to transform our cost base and we're creating good momentum there. And so on the year, we continue to feel good about the 7% to 9% range that we've given, and we believe we have the right building blocks in place on our path to deliver sustainable double-digit margin.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.\nKenneth Zaslow: Just 2 questions. One is automation. Can you talk about the progress and what anecdotal evidence you've seen, how much has been actually done? And is it changing automation story would be helpful.\nDonnie King : Well, automation is -- I've talked about it in a great deal in our productivity program, I talked about at Investor Day, that we anticipate over the next 3 years as that be worth about $450 million to us. So we're spending significant amounts of capital on that. Stewart talked about in his opening remarks about the $2 billion of CapEx for capacity. But a great deal of the money is being spent is on automation and technology that we are deploying. . I would tell you, in our Q1, we are on track. We had a number of different projects, and we've moved from a -- have really moved from a project to project to more of a programmatic approach where we attack common things across our production footprint, for example, could be deboning across all chicken, could be like palletizing, for example, an automation that's available there across the entire enterprise, material handling-type things, but all of these are in terms of priority or the more difficult, harder to staff jobs. And so I would tell you, in short, we are on track. We will deliver $300 million to $400 million in productivity savings, and some of that is coming from the automation piece. To the best of my knowledge, we've not disclosed how much is coming from each sector, but we're moving as quickly as humanly possible as quickly as the supply chain will allow us to get new pieces of equipment and so forth.\nKenneth Zaslow: Great. My second question is on hatchability. We haven't really seen it in the data -- on the public data, but you're saying that you're moving faster than talk about what you're actually seeing in your operation? And when do you think it will actually translate to the numbers in the publicly available data? And just kind of give us a little bit of what you've actually done to move that hatchability up to where you are actually ahead of schedule?\nDavid Bray : Absolutely, Ken. Thank you. I think first and foremost, we do need to say that we are ahead of what we had expected from a Q1 stand point related to our overall hatch. I'll also share with you that -- and again, this is everything specific to Tyson. I mean really I won't speak to and cannot speak to what's happening within the industry. We understand we ended FY '22 with a growth mindset. We really demonstrated that within Q1 where we grew our volumes 3.6%. As we enter '21, I can tell you, we are up in egg sets. We are up in both chicks placed as well as overall breeder production. Our to continue to grow like we did for the -- in Q1 for the balance of '22. Our hatch is a critical component to that.\nDonnie King : I would add this piece of context to that, Ken, that in '22, we have this -- we've -- where we intersect in publicly benchmark data. We have crossed that line with competitors, the industry at large with our hatch.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens.\nBenjamin Bienvenu : So I want to ask, in your presentation that you issued concurrent with the results this morning, you noted on the pork business that there's a continued opportunity around mix, I hope that you could elaborate a little bit on that. And then also to the extent that you think about that as a component of your Chicken business, I know repricing contracts, hatchability and plant productivity are all kind of the highlight items associated with improving that business. Where does mix stand and the opportunity to margin up the Chicken business?\nDonnie King : Okay. Let me start broadly, and then I will let Shane speak a few details around Pork and there are similarities with that. But for example, in the Pork business, the labor availability in pork and chicken has been the single biggest challenge that we've had over the last 2 years in the pandemic. Capacity utilization has been better in pork than it has been in chicken. Labor and capacity utilization is continuing, it has been good in pork and continues to get better. The thing that has hurt us to some degree on both pork and chicken is mix or capturing some things like of harvest in chicken or pause or a similar specialty products in pork. We've just not been able to fully optimize that. For example, in pork, maybe the inability to debone a ham versus selling a whole ham. And those are the type of things. But as we enter '22 in both businesses, we're in a much better position in terms of labor improving, and we still have some ways to go, but we see improving mix and capacity utilization across all businesses. And I'll let Shane speak to -- maybe do a few more things in Pork.\nShane Miller : Yes. Thanks, Donnie, and you hit on most of it there. But I think the other thing to add to this, too, is as we think globally here, Tyson is a global company and we're servicing a lot of companies and countries across the globe. And the key to this is being able to balance that with our domestic business and looking at what we have from a throughput and a labor perspective. So labor has been a challenge. We'll get in the animals through the facility, but it's the further processing we're doing on the back end of the plant that's been a bit of a challenge. So staying focused on optimizing our labor usage and maximizing throughput and contribution when we look at it on a labor per man-hour basis has been the key.\nBenjamin Bienvenu : Okay. That's great. And then my second question is related to export demand. You called out in the presentation as well around Beef that port congestion and labor shortages impacted the business. Export demand has been exceptionally strong for Beef in particular. I'm curious your outlook for this year for continued export demand? And then for Chicken, I know that there's a mix challenges that perhaps weighed on leg quarters domestically. But with this very strong crude backdrop, I would think that would also benefit export demand for domestic leg quarters. So can you talk a little bit about exports and your outlook for that across all the businesses for the balance of the year?\nShane Miller : Yes. So I'll take the Beef question. So the U.S. is a leader in global beef production, and it's centered around our superior taste and quality. And the producers that we're partnering with in this country are doing a phenomenal job are increasingly preferring U.S.-produced beef, and we're seeing stronger global demand as a result of that. Port congestion on the West Coast, as you mentioned, has been an issue, and it's impacting not only the short-term international demand, but also fulfillment on orders that focused on is implemented strategies and options to not only diversify shipping ports, but also to mitigate our risk as we go forward. But we continue to see very good interest coming out of Asia, especially for our high-quality yield and beef. And a good example around that is China. China has become the #3 destination for U.S. beef. And Tyson has a competitive advantage with not only our direct business, but our international business unit that we have in in-country there in China. So significant resources in country, a lot of customers demand in beef, and we feel real good about 2022 and going forward.\nDavid Bray : To answer your question relative to what we're seeing within poultry, very similar to his comments that Shane was making about the demand remains extremely strong. And I would tell you that it's really not a demand and price are really not the issue. We're dealing with the same port congestion in the poultry organization. But that really underscores the need for us as an organization to make sure that we are upgrading our mix and to utilize those in domestic use. A cutting those of the drum and thighs and using them within alternate channels domestically. We are targeting both deli and foodservice for some of those opportunities.\nDonnie King : Let me add one comment to this, that I try to remind everyone. In addition to all the things that both Shane and David have said, I would remind us of the One Tyson approach, which is our international business unit that we have in China. And with leg quarters and pork and beef products and prepared foods product as well. When we export those commodity-based products outside the United States, in many cases today -- or in most cases today, we take them in and further process chicken leg quarters and the like into value-added branded products into China in an approach we call One Tyson. And then we're able to sell it and capture an additional margin on top of all that, eliminating a number of activities and hands touched in the middle of the process. So I'll leave it at that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow : I have a couple of questions. One, I think easy to answer and maybe one that's not so easy. So I'll start with the first. You talked about being able to get fair value for transportation surcharges. A lot food peers can't seem to recoup those charges. So why is yours easier in fresh meat than it is in branded foods to charge the customer for that surcharge? And then I'll wait and ask another one.\nDonnie King : Let me start with that one. Let me start with simply saying that freight costs are up 32% for us. I talked about some of the technology we use to -- in my opening remarks, where we would intersect between our private fleet contract fleet outside carriers and try to optimize how we do that. And we've seen a lot -- we've had a lot of success. It took like a lot of the inflation happened so rapidly. It took a bit to get on top of that. But thus far, we have been successful in being able to get the transportation and we've asked our customers to pay us for that and pay us for freight, and we've been successful in doing so.\nRobert Moskow : So is it -- go ahead.\nDonnie King : \u2026else is not able to do that.\nRobert Moskow : So is it easier in one part of the business than it is in another part of the business, like easier in fresh and not so easy in branded?\nDonnie King : Not -- as I look around the room and from all those leading the businesses, I don't think if you're a branded portfolio versus a more commodity-oriented business, I don't think that really matters. What we tried to do with our customers is say, freight is freight and the price of the product and the price of the product, and we don't -- we try not to blend the 2. And so I don't -- I wouldn't say one is any easier than the other. But I think the fact of the matter is what -- this freight being up 32%, that's what it cost to get the product moved and delivered to a customer, and we're asking our customers to pay for that. Anything to add?\nShane Miller : Yes, I was going to say -- this is Shane. The only thing I'd are certain markets that are a little more difficult to shift into versus others. So you got to think about backhauls and what your cost mechanism is going to be to recover that, too. So that would be the only other component I'd add on to what Donnie said.\nRobert Moskow : Okay. Great. Here's the second question. The industry has been dealing with a labor shortage for a long time. It's unclear when it's going to get better. In the past, I remember hearing that Tyson and others have found pockets of international immigrants, communities to source, to improve their labor utilization in certain facilities. Is that -- is your access to international immigrants compromised in the current environment, more so than it has in the past? And is there something that the industry can do to gain access to more people from international locations in a legal fashion?\nDonnie King : Well, you're right. Labor has been a challenge for a bit now. We looked at this in terms of trying to solve for Tyson. And our approach has been to try to create a better place for people to work, a better work experience with less turnover and less absenteeism with just keeping team members safe. In our first quarter, we paid $50 million in bonuses to our team members for no reason other than to say thank you for choosing Tyson. Thank you for being on our team. And we've had to do a number of things like piloting childcare and subsidized child care, onsite clinics. And we've also are investing with our strong balance sheet heavily in terms of automation to take away some of those more difficult jobs. Now our workforce, to be clear, is made up of a number of different immigrants and people from all over the world in different nationalities and so we've benefited through the years like many others have of having such a diverse workforce. And so we continue to pursue those things like Afghan refugees. We tried to be available with -- working with the government in terms of having availability and we've worked with communities in terms of trying to build or define housing to support that, to make it easier. I mean we're doing all kinds of things along that line to be able to make it easy to do business with Tyson, easy to go to work for Tyson and do it all the right way. And so that's been our approach. I know of no magic or no pool of people anywhere that we are targeting to try to take care of the labor situation. We're trying to solve it by doing a number of things to make us a better place to work.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery : Good morning. You touched on elasticities a little bit, and I realize they've held up quite well. We've heard that from a lot of companies. But just curious how you think about some of your assumptions for that going forward? And especially just with pricing up as strongly as it is, that's a few multiples of what wage growth looks like. So just curious what your planning assumptions are for how that unfolds over the rest of the year? And maybe a little bit color by segment, if you can.\nDonnie King : Noelle? Would you like to start with that?\nNoelle O'Mara : Sure. So as I mentioned, we're constantly reviewing pricing and revenue management strategies, and it is a dynamic environment. And as the environment continues to evolve, we'll be very thoughtful about our approaches. Pricing is just one of the levers in our toolkit. We look at productivity and cost opportunities and other levers to ensure that we have all the pieces coming together to best grow our brands and create business continuity and profitability. And so maybe the other aspects that I would point to is that we have a broad and diverse portfolio with a range of price points to ensure that we have offerings that meet a variety of consumer needs and price pack architecture also becomes critical in these inflationary times, and you see that focus for us across the business.\nDonnie King : Yes. I would add this to what Noelle said, we have seen a lot of inflation. But I would remind you that cost of food in the U.S., while it is higher, is relative to the balance of the world. Labor costs have been up 20%, cattle costs are up -- have been -- they're up 22%. Grain has been up 29% this year and freight, I mentioned earlier, is up 32%. We're not asking customers or the consumer ultimately to pay for our inefficiencies. We're asking them to pay for inflation. And the rest of what we do is we try to find ways to be more productive, to lower cost and increase throughputs and so forth. And we feel good about our ability to do a lot of that while serving our customers.\nMichael Lavery : The inflation headwinds are obviously clear and certainly a driver of the pricing. But just maybe expect to some of your assumptions on the elasticities. Maybe, at a very high level, do you assume they revert to more normal levels or that they can hold at sort of what we're seeing currently?\nDonnie King : They are where they are right now. And I know that's not a very good answer. I mean there is a price point where it could be impactful. But at Tyson, we play across the spectrum from the most value-added products to the most commodity of commodity products and we meet the consumer wherever they are on the value chain. And so we intend to continue to grow our business and serve those consumers wherever they are.\nMichael Lavery : Okay. Great. And I just want to follow up on the chicken pricing and understand some of the flexibility that you've implemented. And maybe just understand if it's meant to allow for more upside or if it drives more volatility. Is it flexible in both directions? Or does it have any sort of floors that just mostly allow for easier increases?\nStewart Glendinning : Absolutely. Thank very much. And again, there's flexibility both going up and there's flexibility going down. Our partners in both retail and food stores understand what those metrics are. And we will go up and we will go down based off of how we put our programs together. But the biggest piece of it is the fact that it is much more variable today than it has been at any point in time.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donnie King, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.\nDonnie King: Thank you, Andrea, and thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking again soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stewart Glendinning",
            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. We're pleased to report a strong overall start to the year. Our sales were up approximately 24% in the first quarter, largely a function of our pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures. Volumes were also up slightly, although impacted by continued labor challenges. Looking at our sales results by channel, retail drove almost $350 million of top line improvements versus last year. Improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $1 billion and our export sales were nearly $333 million stronger than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. First quarter operating income of $1.4 billion was up 40% relative to the same quarter last year due to increased earnings in Beef, Pork and Chicken. Driven by the strength in operating income, first quarter earnings per share grew 48% to $2.87. Higher operating income led to higher adjusted earnings per share compared to the same period last year. And first quarter EPS also benefited from lower interest expense and taxes. Slide 10 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was $407 million higher than fiscal 2021. Volumes were up slightly during the year, primarily a result of improvement in Chicken, Pork and International/Other, offset by declines in Beef and Prepared Foods. Declines in Beef and Prepared Foods were largely due to continued labor challenges in those segments. Our pricing actions led to approximately $2.1 billion in sales and price/mix benefit during the quarter, which offset the higher cost of goods sold of $1.6 billion. We saw continued inflation across the business, in some instances, up 20% to 30%. Notable examples were labor, grain costs, live cattle and hog costs and freight costs. And finally, SG&A was $88 million unfavorable to the same period last year, which was largely a result of cycling a $55 million benefit recorded last year for the recovery of cattle. Moving to the Beef segment. Segment sales were more than $5 billion for the quarter, up 25% versus the same period last year. Sales growth was driven by continued strong demand for beef products, which has supported higher average sales price. Partially offsetting higher sales prices were higher capital costs during the first quarter versus the comparable prior year period. We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. We have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal year 2022 and continue to expect it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs. We delivered segment operating income of $956 million, up 81% versus the prior comparable period. This improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cut out, which were partially offset by higher operating costs. Our operating margin of 19.1% was notably higher than the same quarter last year but was down on a sequential basis versus the last 2 quarters as cost increases led to a narrowing of the spread. Now let's move on to the Pork segment on Slide 12. Segment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 13% versus the same period last year. Key sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment. Average sales price increased 12.8% and volumes were slightly higher relative to the same period last year. Segment operating income was $164 million for the quarter, up 41% versus the comparable period. Overall, operating margins for the segment improved to 10.1% for the quarter. The operating income improvement was driven by higher spreads in the business. Moving now to Prepared Foods. Sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 10% relative to the same period last year. Total volume was down in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice more than offset by labor and supply chain challenges. Sales growth outpaced volume growth driven by inflation-justified pricing. During the quarter, retail core business mines maintained share, driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong execution by our team. Operating margins for the segment were 8% or $186 million for the first quarter. The decline in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw material and other input costs that we were recover cost increases during fiscal 2022. In addition to pricing, we've executed productivity, revenue management and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support. Moving into the Chicken segment's results. Sales were $3.9 billion for the quarter, up 37%. Volumes improved 3.6% in the quarter due to strong consumer demand and increased life production. Our teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal 2022 as hatch recovers, and we continue to look for ways to operate our plant more efficiently. Average sales price improved around 20% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation. On pricing, we made tremendous progress toward driving our pricing mechanisms toward more variable structures and are now seeing those benefits. We restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal 2021 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions. Chicken delivered adjusted operating income of $117 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing an operating margin of 3%. Operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $185 million of higher feed ingredient costs. Now turning to Slide 15. As part of our capital allocation approach, we focused on building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. In pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we used improved earnings to retire debt in fiscal year 2021 and expect to do the same this year. Continued strength in our earnings this quarter have further improved our leverage ratio to 1.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Investing in our business for both organic and inorganic growth will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities. This will support strong return generation for our shareholders. Finally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks. We finished the quarter with a powerful balance sheet and continued capital allocation optionality. Let's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook. We are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $49 billion to $51 billion, although we expect to perform at the upper end of the range. In support of our sales growth, we still expect a 2% to 3% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full. Looking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments, in Chicken, our operational turnaround is working and we still expect to achieve a run rate profitability of 5% to 7% by the middle of the year. We expect full year margins that also fall between 5% to 7%. Prepared Foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%. Based on our first quarter performance, we now expect the full year margin performance in Prepared Foods to be at the upper end of the range. In Beef, we are maintaining our AOI margin at 9% to 11%, but we expect to perform at the upper end of the range. Also, we expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year. In Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%. As is normal seasonality for pork, we expect the first quarter to be the strongest. In International/Other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability. Consistent with our expectation for a meaningful increase in CapEx spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles, we anticipate CapEx spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal 2022. We now expect lower net interest expense due to lower anticipated average debt balances during the fiscal year. Our expectations for productivity savings and tax rate changes remain unchanged. Our net leverage is expected to remain well below 2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders over the course of the year. In summary, we've had a strong start to the fiscal year. We have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity and the differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. We set out ambitious calls at our Investor Day, and we expect to achieve them.  I'll now turn the call back over to Megan for Q&A instructions. Megan? Yes. Look, thanks for that, Adam. If you go back to Investor Day, we were really focused on being able to point to the strong growth story that sits in front of our Tyson's future. And part of that was a pretty significant allocation of increased capital to CapEx spending and various capacity expansion. So it was an intention to leave stock buyback to the end, but stock buybacks have been talked about in history, and they will be in the future. The one thing we've said is that we do look each year to try to buy back the dilution. And after that, it will be more opportunistic. But growth is a focus for our company. Yes. So I would tell you, within Chicken specifically, I would tell you, we have restructured our pricing approach, and that's really in large part, thanks to our commercial organization as well as the great customer relationships that we have across both our retail and food service networks. I would tell you today, we are significantly more variable pricing versus fixed. And again, we're not even utilizing fixed rate within our conversations. Every contractor program that we have is either tied to grain, tied to market value and we will continue to use that. Pricing was up significantly in Chicken in the Q1 time frame of over 20%, and a large part of that was because of the variable programs that we put in place. Absolutely. Thank very much. And again, there's flexibility both going up and there's flexibility going down. Our partners in both retail and food stores understand what those metrics are. And we will go up and we will go down based off of how we put our programs together. But the biggest piece of it is the fact that it is much more variable today than it has been at any point in time."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan, and thank you to everyone for joining us for the call today. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter fiscal 2022 results. Tyson Foods once again delivered strong financial results. I would like to start by thanking our team members for their dedication, Herculean efforts this quarter as we managed a complex and dynamic operating environment. At our Investor Day, I shared our plan to grow our top and bottom lines aggressively over the next 3 years. This meant EPS growth of high single digits relative to a 2019 baseline and volume growth ahead of the market. Our results this quarter put us firmly on that path. We achieved double-digit sales and earnings growth, both of which were driven by ongoing demand strength, productivity savings and improving execution across our segments. Our diverse protein portfolio, omnichannel capabilities, leading brands and value-added products contributed to our results. Strong performance in our Beef segment, earlier-than-expected recovery in Prepared Foods and improvement in Chicken and Pork, all supported strong earning results. Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park maintain their volume share position even as we work through price increases to address inflationary pressure. And our foodservice focused 6 product lines grew share year-over-year in broadline distribution. This growth was driven in large part by value-added chicken, which outperformed industry recovery and breakfast sausage where we were seeing improved fill rates. Importantly, and despite the continued impact of COVID-19, our volumes improved slightly across the company relative to the same quarter last year. Chicken was a bright spot, where we saw our volumes improved 3.6%. While this is a good start, we are not where we want to be on volume. So we're taking actions segment by segment to improve our volume performance. These actions include investing in our team members, in additional capacity and in brands and product innovation. As discussed at Investor Day, we are also in the process of building 12 new plants. Each of these is progressing and each will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and meet the growing global demand for protein. Bottom line, we're committed to improving our total company volumes during the year. We're also making sure that our pricing incorporates inflationary cost pressures on our business. In the quarter, our cost of goods sold was up 18% relative to the same period last year. We are seeing higher costs across our supply chain, including higher input costs, such as feed and ingredients. We're also managing higher cost of labor, transportation due to strong demand and limited availability. With these higher costs, we work closely with our customers to achieve a fair value for our products. As a result, our average sales price for the quarter increased 19.6% relative to the same period last year. This helped us capture some of the unrecovered costs due to the timing lag between inflation and price. Finally, our balance sheet and overall liquidity position are strong, providing optionality to pursue strategic growth priorities and invest in growth across our portfolio. We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital to support capacity expansion while achieving improved returns on invested capital. Our first quarter results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives, that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins and driving strong returns for our shareholders. While we're growing our business, we are mindful of our corporate responsibilities around environment, social and governance goals. For example, we committed to investing in and supporting our communities in rural America and around the world. Last year, Tyson Foods donated more than 16 million pounds of protein, the equivalent of 64 million meals to fight hunger. We're incredibly proud of this work and the people that make it possible. Tyson is a great company with a great team doing great things, and I'm pleased that this was recognized just last week by Fortune Magazine, who announced that for the sixth year in a row, Tyson Foods was #1 in our sector in their rankings of the world's most admired companies. Now let's look at a few financial highlights from the first quarter. Our results included double-digit top and bottom line growth. We delivered solid operating income performance, up 40% for the quarter. This performance was broad-based across segments where continued strong consumer demand and effective pricing to mitigate the impact of inflation drove higher earnings. On volume, we are up slightly. And while we're working to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and the ability to achieve optimal mix across our network. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, our volume performance is outpacing our peer set. In retail, despite substantial market pressures, core business lines held share in the first quarter, led by strong performance in lunch meat, hotdogs, snacking and bacon. We also realized strong e-commerce results with Tyson Foods outpacing total food and beverage growth and our core lines gaining share in the quarter. Still, customer demand continues to outpace our ability to supply products. So we have targeted actions in each segment to improve volumes. This is key to delivering on our commitments. To realize our volume goals, we must be able to fully staff our plants across the company. We continue to take meaningful action toward becoming the most sought after place to work. For example, we provided our hourly team members with more than $50 million in bonuses during the first quarter. We are piloting subsidized and on-site childcare and we are adjusting schedules to flex with workforce needs. These actions are bearing fruit as we see some improvement on the labor front. And while we have seen some labor challenges during the Omicron surge, we are generally seeing lower turnover in absenteeism. We saw Chicken volumes grow 3.6% in the quarter, driven by strong fundamental demand and improved live production. What is important to note is that we grew ahead of the market and gained market share. In Prepared Foods, volumes were down 2.6% in the first quarter. About half of the decline was related to Pet Treats divestiture. We expect to sequentially improve these results over the remainder of fiscal year '22 as we take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization. In Beef, volumes were down 6.2%, driven by labor shortages previously mentioned. In addition, port congestion has also dipped in export volumes in the segment. We expect these headwinds on volume to normalize over the course of fiscal 2022. In Pork, we have sequentially improved our capacity utilization. We are still working to optimize the mix. In International/Other, while we are starting from a relatively small base, our investment in capacity, innovation and brands are supporting our market share growth objective. Overall, we expect to grow our total company volumes by 2% to 3% in FY '22, outpacing protein consumption growth. Chicken remains a top priority and we continue to execute against our road map to achieve an operating income margin of 5% to 7% on a run rate basis by mid fiscal '22. I remain confident we will meet this goal. In the first quarter, we've started to see profitability improvement resulting from our actions. For example, we're investing aggressively in automation and technology to help us address some of the most hard to fill roles. This is not a series of projects, but is a well-planned program with automation, designed to use common designs and equipment across our plants to optimize cost, maintenance and asset utilization. The second imperative is to improve operational performance and critical to improving performance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage which means having enough birds to run our plants full. Since September, we've seen an improvement in our hatch rate ahead of our expectations. We continue to expect full recovery in this year. We were pleased with our volume growth in the quarter and expect further improvements as we grow our harvest capacity utilization from an average of 37 million head per week in FY '21 to 40 million head per week by year-end. We've noted previously that strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products put our buy versus grow program at a relative disadvantage. We have reduced our reliance on outside meat accordingly. We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our volumes and be the best in the business. The plan we have continues to be the right plan and our commitment to winning with our team members, winning with our customers and consumers and winning with operational excellence is delivering results. Last year, we announced the launch of a new productivity program designed to drive a better, faster, more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. The program aims to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline and has 3 critical focus areas, which are operational and functional excellence, digital solutions and automation. We're making some good progress on this front. I spoke just a minute ago about our investments in automation, but we've also attacked other issues. In Prepared Foods, we're making use of supply chain, digitization and advanced analytics. Our digital manufacturing platform allows us to analyze real-time data to take actions to optimize process conditions that drive better yields, lower costs, consistent quality and increased output. In transportation and logistics, we have established ongoing optimization of the mix and allocation of our private fleet, dedicated fleet and third-party fleet, mitigating inflationary pressures and supporting better on-time deliveries to our customers. In addition, we continued the expansion of our direct shipment program, reducing miles driven and product touches in our supply chain. As a result of projects like these, we're on track to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings in fiscal 2022. We shared at our Investor Day that we are taking actions to accelerate our growth and drive disciplined return on invested capital. The 5 imperatives on this slide show how we will achieve our commitments and drive value creation. This starts first with our commitment to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment. We are proud of our COVID-19 vaccine policy implemented last year in the U.S. and of the broader investments that we have made to keep our team members, their families and our communities safe. Because of our policy, our team members are better protected and the cases we do see have been mild or asymptomatic, resulting in an extremely low number of hospitalizations. We are strongly encouraging boosters and are hosting clinics to make it easier for our team members and their families to get boosted. Second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better address demand. This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales. As a result, we expect our volume to outpace this growing market. Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment. This starts by returning our operating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022. Fourth, we're driving operational and functional excellence and investing in digital and automation initiatives. This is at the heart of our new productivity program. We're working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization. Fifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we are using our financial strength to invest in our business. On capital alone, we're expected to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. And we continue to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned over $500 million in dividends and share repurchases. To wrap it up, we are committed to winning with our team members, customers and consumers as well as winning with operational excellence. I'm more excited about the future of Tyson Foods with each passing day. And I will now turn the call over to Stewart to walk us through our financial results in detail. Well, let me start off with and tell you that we really got off to a good start in Q1. And there are a number of factors with Q1 and what we saw in Q1 and our optimism as we look to the balance of the year. We've adjusted a number of pricing mechanisms to be more variable in nature. We've seen prior elasticities, for example, in Prepared Foods being less or lower than what they have historically been, which is exciting there. We've been able to maintain volume in this inflationary environment. Inflation, as we see it will continue -- is continuing to move up. We're really excited about our productivity program relative to the whole company. We're anticipating $300 million, $400 million, and we're on track through Q1 relative to that. Just doing what we do better and we talk about becoming a more agile, faster decision-making organization. Essentially, that's all about process and being better, faster and making decision that with greater speed at lower levels within the organization. But because of our vaccination position, we've now moved past the surge of the Omicron spike, as we call it, which occurred predominantly in the first 3 weeks of January, and we're back to normal levels. We think our vaccine mandate served us well and making that commitment and really making our team members' health and safety and their families and communities our highest priority has served us through the new variant. We've seen better absenteeism and turnover throughout the organization. We think labor will be available, will be much greater in the balance of the year. And we certainly have capacities coming online with head and harvest and Chicken and further processing capabilities, value-added capabilities in Prepared and Chicken. And we've got labor going back into beef and pork plants, and we'll be able to improve those mixes as well as increase the harvest capacity. Okay, Peter, I'll tell you. I'll start, and then I will let David make a few comments. But over the last year or so, we've been -- the recovery for our Chicken business has been a priority. Specifically, as it relates to buy versus grow, the fact of the matter is, we became too dependent on the buy portion of the model. And we forgot to grow Chicken, which hurt us from a capacity utilization perspective and those additional pounds flowing through our business really impacted our fixed cost leverage. So we tilted too far on the buy portion of this. And over the last year, as we been building the breeding stock and getting past the hatch issue that we talked about so much last year, we're now in a better position to get more head through our processing and harvest facilities and which will give us more breast meat at a much more attractive price point versus the buy in the marketplace right now. We have not totally abandoned the buy portion and do not anticipate totally abandoning that, but there's a smaller percentage of our overall needs that we will go to the market to secure. But we're on plan with what we intended to do. And with that, David, why don't you add a little bit. I would add to this that we are -- we have in our biosecurity programs, we have green, which is just normal business; yellow, orange and red, which are progressive. On the East Coast, as Dave mentioned, we are in the orange category at this point. So a lot of attention and a lot of watching. I saw the case over the weekend in Florida, which I think now is 5 states, which we have seen avian influenza. Sure. Well, I mean, we're still in the plant-based protein business. We still like it. Consumer demand continues to be good. We've seen a lot more growth late. But across retail and foodservice, we continue to see growth. Now that's off a very small base, as you might imagine. But we're continuing to see growth. But for us, with our presence outside the United States, in Europe and China, and also in Southeast Asia, we also have plant-based products in those markets that are doing really, really well also. So we're still excited about the plant-based business and when consumers prefer that, we want to have the opportunity to be able to provide that for them and are currently and are growing. And let me ask Noelle if there's anything she'd like to add to that. Well, automation is -- I've talked about it in a great deal in our productivity program, I talked about at Investor Day, that we anticipate over the next 3 years as that be worth about $450 million to us. So we're spending significant amounts of capital on that. Stewart talked about in his opening remarks about the $2 billion of CapEx for capacity. But a great deal of the money is being spent is on automation and technology that we are deploying. . I would tell you, in our Q1, we are on track. We had a number of different projects, and we've moved from a -- have really moved from a project to project to more of a programmatic approach where we attack common things across our production footprint, for example, could be deboning across all chicken, could be like palletizing, for example, an automation that's available there across the entire enterprise, material handling-type things, but all of these are in terms of priority or the more difficult, harder to staff jobs. And so I would tell you, in short, we are on track. We will deliver $300 million to $400 million in productivity savings, and some of that is coming from the automation piece. To the best of my knowledge, we've not disclosed how much is coming from each sector, but we're moving as quickly as humanly possible as quickly as the supply chain will allow us to get new pieces of equipment and so forth. I would add this piece of context to that, Ken, that in '22, we have this -- we've -- where we intersect in publicly benchmark data. We have crossed that line with competitors, the industry at large with our hatch. Okay. Let me start broadly, and then I will let Shane speak a few details around Pork and there are similarities with that. But for example, in the Pork business, the labor availability in pork and chicken has been the single biggest challenge that we've had over the last 2 years in the pandemic. Capacity utilization has been better in pork than it has been in chicken. Labor and capacity utilization is continuing, it has been good in pork and continues to get better. The thing that has hurt us to some degree on both pork and chicken is mix or capturing some things like of harvest in chicken or pause or a similar specialty products in pork. We've just not been able to fully optimize that. For example, in pork, maybe the inability to debone a ham versus selling a whole ham. And those are the type of things. But as we enter '22 in both businesses, we're in a much better position in terms of labor improving, and we still have some ways to go, but we see improving mix and capacity utilization across all businesses. And I'll let Shane speak to -- maybe do a few more things in Pork. Let me add one comment to this, that I try to remind everyone. In addition to all the things that both Shane and David have said, I would remind us of the One Tyson approach, which is our international business unit that we have in China. And with leg quarters and pork and beef products and prepared foods product as well. When we export those commodity-based products outside the United States, in many cases today -- or in most cases today, we take them in and further process chicken leg quarters and the like into value-added branded products into China in an approach we call One Tyson. And then we're able to sell it and capture an additional margin on top of all that, eliminating a number of activities and hands touched in the middle of the process. So I'll leave it at that. Let me start with that one. Let me start with simply saying that freight costs are up 32% for us. I talked about some of the technology we use to -- in my opening remarks, where we would intersect between our private fleet contract fleet outside carriers and try to optimize how we do that. And we've seen a lot -- we've had a lot of success. It took like a lot of the inflation happened so rapidly. It took a bit to get on top of that. But thus far, we have been successful in being able to get the transportation and we've asked our customers to pay us for that and pay us for freight, and we've been successful in doing so. ...else is not able to do that. Not -- as I look around the room and from all those leading the businesses, I don't think if you're a branded portfolio versus a more commodity-oriented business, I don't think that really matters. What we tried to do with our customers is say, freight is freight and the price of the product and the price of the product, and we don't -- we try not to blend the 2. And so I don't -- I wouldn't say one is any easier than the other. But I think the fact of the matter is what -- this freight being up 32%, that's what it cost to get the product moved and delivered to a customer, and we're asking our customers to pay for that. Anything to add? Well, you're right. Labor has been a challenge for a bit now. We looked at this in terms of trying to solve for Tyson. And our approach has been to try to create a better place for people to work, a better work experience with less turnover and less absenteeism with just keeping team members safe. In our first quarter, we paid $50 million in bonuses to our team members for no reason other than to say thank you for choosing Tyson. Thank you for being on our team. And we've had to do a number of things like piloting childcare and subsidized child care, onsite clinics. And we've also are investing with our strong balance sheet heavily in terms of automation to take away some of those more difficult jobs. Now our workforce, to be clear, is made up of a number of different immigrants and people from all over the world in different nationalities and so we've benefited through the years like many others have of having such a diverse workforce. And so we continue to pursue those things like Afghan refugees. We tried to be available with -- working with the government in terms of having availability and we've worked with communities in terms of trying to build or define housing to support that, to make it easier. I mean we're doing all kinds of things along that line to be able to make it easy to do business with Tyson, easy to go to work for Tyson and do it all the right way. And so that's been our approach. I know of no magic or no pool of people anywhere that we are targeting to try to take care of the labor situation. We're trying to solve it by doing a number of things to make us a better place to work. Noelle? Would you like to start with that? Yes. I would add this to what Noelle said, we have seen a lot of inflation. But I would remind you that cost of food in the U.S., while it is higher, is relative to the balance of the world. Labor costs have been up 20%, cattle costs are up -- have been -- they're up 22%. Grain has been up 29% this year and freight, I mentioned earlier, is up 32%. We're not asking customers or the consumer ultimately to pay for our inefficiencies. We're asking them to pay for inflation. And the rest of what we do is we try to find ways to be more productive, to lower cost and increase throughputs and so forth. And we feel good about our ability to do a lot of that while serving our customers. They are where they are right now. And I know that's not a very good answer. I mean there is a price point where it could be impactful. But at Tyson, we play across the spectrum from the most value-added products to the most commodity of commodity products and we meet the consumer wherever they are on the value chain. And so we intend to continue to grow our business and serve those consumers wherever they are. Thank you, Andrea, and thanks again for your interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking again soon."

            "name": "David Bray",
            "content": "Yes. I think -- Peter, thank you for the question. I think one way also look at this is we will buy outside meat to the extent it is the right financial decision. From our standpoint, we will continue to manage against what is right, as whether buy versus grow. But generally, outside meat purchases are going to be used to supplement what we're doing when it's the right financial decision. And as what Donnie -- as Donnie stated, volume is critical. It's one of the big levers of what we are going to accomplish in FY '22 to grow the animals ourselves into processes, and that will make us much more efficient. Yes, absolutely. Ken, good morning. Thank you. And yes, the USDA has reported that this high patent variant has only been found in the wild bird population. And it's really been within the East Coast of the United States. I would tell you more specifically to what Tyson is doing versus what the industry is doing is, but we have a very robust biosecurity measures in place across all of our facilities, and that includes testing every flock for avian influenza. In addition, at Tyson, we have heightened our biosecurity measures in all of our facilities on the East Coast. Some of those things that we've done are we're reducing number of trips that we're taking to farms. We're actually taking extra time and doing more cleaning of our vehicles that do go to the farms, but we are ahead of this and have been watching it very closely. Absolutely, Ken. Thank you. I think first and foremost, we do need to say that we are ahead of what we had expected from a Q1 stand point related to our overall hatch. I'll also share with you that -- and again, this is everything specific to Tyson. I mean really I won't speak to and cannot speak to what's happening within the industry. We understand we ended FY '22 with a growth mindset. We really demonstrated that within Q1 where we grew our volumes 3.6%. As we enter '21, I can tell you, we are up in egg sets. We are up in both chicks placed as well as overall breeder production. Our to continue to grow like we did for the -- in Q1 for the balance of '22. Our hatch is a critical component to that. To answer your question relative to what we're seeing within poultry, very similar to his comments that Shane was making about the demand remains extremely strong. And I would tell you that it's really not a demand and price are really not the issue. We're dealing with the same port congestion in the poultry organization. But that really underscores the need for us as an organization to make sure that we are upgrading our mix and to utilize those in domestic use. A cutting those of the drum and thighs and using them within alternate channels domestically. We are targeting both deli and foodservice for some of those opportunities."
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Noelle O'Mara",
            "content": "Sure. Just as a build, we want to be leaders across all the proteins that consumers seek. And we know that consumer interest in adoption is growing in this space. And we'll continue to be guided by the consumer needs and the opportunities and -- you see the Raised & Rooted products that we've launched domestically. We continue to have opportunities internationally, and we'll continue to ensure that we are participating with consumer interest and adoption growth. I can give you a bit of context to what we're currently seeing. So demand continues to be strong across both retail and foodservice driven by our strong equities in our diverse portfolio. And as you said, we're pleased with the market performance that we're seeing despite the price increases, which is really due to the strength of our brands and the strong partnership and relationships that we've built with our customers. Elasticity has been less than the historical models that Donnie has mentioned, but it's clearly something that we're watching closely. And so we're constantly reviewing our pricing and revenue management strategies. As the landscape changes, we'll continue to take thoughtful approaches on those critical levers. As you also heard in the comments, we're taking significant actions to transform our cost base and we're creating good momentum there. And so on the year, we continue to feel good about the 7% to 9% range that we've given, and we believe we have the right building blocks in place on our path to deliver sustainable double-digit margin. Sure. So as I mentioned, we're constantly reviewing pricing and revenue management strategies, and it is a dynamic environment. And as the environment continues to evolve, we'll be very thoughtful about our approaches. Pricing is just one of the levers in our toolkit. We look at productivity and cost opportunities and other levers to ensure that we have all the pieces coming together to best grow our brands and create business continuity and profitability. And so maybe the other aspects that I would point to is that we have a broad and diverse portfolio with a range of price points to ensure that we have offerings that meet a variety of consumer needs and price pack architecture also becomes critical in these inflationary times, and you see that focus for us across the business."

Earlier this morning, we announced our fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2023 results. In Q4, we saw another quarter of sequential improvements in our overall earnings, as we continue to make good progress in improving our performance. And I want to thank our team members for delivering these results in what continues to be a tough macro environment. Consumer demand for protein remains relatively stable and we are well-positioned to meet this demand, giving us confidence in our long-term prospects. Q4 also wraps up an unusual fiscal year for all of our core protein categories were challenged and yet one, where our Branded business delivered solid results, while we continue to see challenging market dynamics, our broader portfolio is set up well for the future. As we anticipated, our results continue to improve sequentially in chicken, with Q4 building on the momentum we gained in Q3 as part of a much better second half of fiscal '23, after a difficult start. Our brands continue to perform well and we grew market share across our core business line, outperforming our peers. This helped our Prepared Foods segment generate solid adjusted operating income in 2023. Market dynamics in beef and pork were challenging this past year, causing spread compression, although for different reasons. Despite these headwinds, our goal remains to be best-in-class operators, so that we can manage these businesses as efficiently as possible. We remain focused on what we can control. One of our priorities is to execute with excellence. Our operations have improved across the business and we have a long runway of opportunities to perform better. Controlling the controllable extends to capital allocation as well, where we will remain disciplined with CapEx and working capital. We continue to execute our multi-point plan focused on efficiency and modernization. You've seen us take bold actions to improve performance and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence and address inefficiencies. Our plan is working and we are seeing tangible benefits of our efforts to end fiscal 2023. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy and optimistic about our future. Rest assured, we are leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Let's dive into an overview of segment performance by starting with an update on market share. Our brands continue to outpace the broader food and beverage category in volume growth across the retail channel in Q4. Our volume grew, while the overwhelming majority of food and beverage peers saw volume declines. Our core business lines including the iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park, saw a Q4 volume growth of 3.2% versus last year, far outpacing our competition. Those four brands also all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete, delivering both pound and dollar share gains across our core business lines. We are accelerating foodservice, where our Focus 6 categories, including value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon, and Philly Steak outpaced the broad-line industry in volume growth in the quarter both versus last year and sequentially. We have a strong foodservice portfolio and are aligning with key customers as we build momentum for the future. Speaking of winning with customers, we're proud to have made the Top 10 for the second year in a row in the most recent Kantar Power Rankings. In fact, Tyson, finished in the Top 10 in seven of the nine categories they measure, as we continue to focus on meeting customer needs and planning the future together with them. Moving to our segments, beginning with Prepared Foods. As I mentioned, our brands performed well in Q4, in fact, over the last year, nearly three quarter of US households purchased a Tyson core business line product, which is an increase of 90 basis points. While this is impressive across our portfolio, it's worth noting that our product with the highest penetration rate is only in about a third of households, leaving us room for continued growth. This performance in retail health Prepared Foods have a solid year in fiscal '23, with strong growth in AOI. As you know, our Branded Foods business is a strategic growth pillar for the future. We believe it is imperative to support our brands with marketing and advertising. As consumers began to face what could be a more difficult economic environment, we ramped up our math support for our brands in the second half of the year and will continue to do so as we move into fiscal 2024. While the full-year AOI for chicken was a modest loss, our progress toward improved performance continued in Q4, with sequential improvement versus Q3. In fact, this is the second consecutive quarter with more than $100 million in sequential AOI increases. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished over the past six months. Not only did we hold on to the operational enhancements we made in Q3, we made incremental improvements in yield and in our live operations. This allowed us to take advantage of improving market conditions, including lower grain costs, leading to a positive margin to end the year. As we head into the new fiscal year, we expect a better outlook for input costs, while we're seeing the benefits of some of the bold actions we took this year. Coming into fiscal '23, we expect it to be under pressure due to limited cattle supply. This trend held true, as cattle costs appreciated at a faster rate than the wholesale price of boxed pieces, eroding export opportunities due to a strong US dollar and low prices of competing exporters, and ultimately creating a very tight spread scenario. We also expected to see signs of rebuild of the herd to surface as cattle prices moved higher. However, this did not materialize. Until significant heifer retention and subsequent herd rebuilding takes place, we expect challenging supply conditions to remain. In this context, while the timing remains uncertain, we will be prepared by focusing on operational discipline. Moving to pork, as you know in fiscal '23 the industry suffered from supply-and-demand imbalances, which negatively impacted spreads. While we are seeing some signs of improving spreads and lower grain costs, there is still an imbalance between the supply and demand of pork. Our team is focused on running the business as efficiently as possible while continuing to review all the options. We saw significant sequential and year-over-year improvement in AOI in Q4, driven primarily by improving spreads and operational enhancements. Before I turn the call over to John to review our financials and FY '24 guidance, I want to give you my priorities for the coming year. First is improving our financial strength with a focus on cash. I want to emphasize that we will be disciplined and prudent with capital while remaining committed to our dividend as the primary way of returning cash to shareholders. As you saw in our earnings press release this morning, we increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year. We will continue to evaluate our production footprint and network to drive efficiencies. As you saw, we've made significant changes in chicken by announcing the closure of six of our older, less efficient plants, which we expect to improve our capacity utilization and mix. In a similar move to leverage efficiencies and reduce network redundancies, we also recently made the difficult decision to take two of our smaller fresh meat's case-ready value-added facilities offline. Production from these locations will shift to larger, more efficient plants, and our harvest capacity, sales volume, and importantly, our customers will see no impact. We are reviewing, whether there are similar opportunities across our segments. In chicken, we will remain focused on further enhancing our competitiveness going forward. Prepared Foods was the profit engine for the company last year. We want to sustain and build on ad strength by supporting our brands and driving momentum in food service while being responsive to changes in market conditions. Some of the key focus areas are making better use of our data, shifting more of our MAP support to digital media, and being disciplined with revenue management. In beef, multiple outcomes are possible during the current cattle cycle. We believe we have best-in-class assets and team members and are aligning with the right suppliers and customers, giving us confidence that we'll be prepared for all of them. In pork, we believe we have a bright future ahead of us and are excited about the team we've built that continues to drive operational improvements and synergies with our prepared foods business. As we said before, we're taking a hard look at our cost structure to drive operational excellence. Our ongoing productivity initiatives are focused on things that can be deployed at scale enterprise-wide, including procurement, logistics, and digitalization. These are a few of the initiatives that will make us a fundamentally stronger business as we go forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn R. Tyson: Thank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results, and then review our individual segments. Our sales were down year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal '23, driven by pork and chicken, where we saw a reduction in price per pound. The decline in adjusted operating profit for both periods was driven by lower profitability in beef and chicken. While profit in Q4 was down substantially versus last year, it's important to note that it continued to improve on a sequential basis and adjusted EPS more than doubled compared to Q3. Challenges remain, but we continue to drive efficiencies and improve our operations, and we believe we're headed in the right direction. Now, onto the individual segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, revenue was down modestly in Q4 year-over-year, driven by lower bacon pricing. This lower pricing was offset by volume growth, which highlights the strength of our brands. AOI improved slightly year-over-year, despite lower sales. Our ongoing productivity initiatives and easing inflation offset lower pricing, increased marketing, advertising, and promotional support, and the onset of start-up costs for our new facilities. AOI margin declined sequentially in Q4 due to seasonality, increased brand support, and start-up costs. However, the $151 million of AOI the segment generated is the second-highest Q4 result in the past five years. In the full year, fiscal '23, AOI grew by more than $100 million, representing growth of nearly 14% year-over-year. Now, moving to chicken, sales declined 10% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by lower pricing, reflecting primarily lower commodity protein prices. Volume grew modestly in Q4 versus last year, driven by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory, and this was partially offset by a decline in production. This decrease in production highlights our ongoing focus on balancing supply with our customer's demand. Year-over-year profitability declined primarily due to lower commodity chicken pricing, but this was partially offset by lower input costs and operational efficiencies. On a sequential basis, lower grain cost and productivity enhancements drove another quarter of AOI improvement. In fact, when we compare to Q4 to Q2, chicken AOI increased by more than $240 million. In beef, revenue increased modestly year-over-year in Q4, with lower head throughput offset by higher pricing. Operating profit was down, reflecting compressed spreads, primarily due to higher cattle costs. As we have been discussing all year, beef is likely to continue to face headwinds, including in fiscal '24, as we don't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until herd rebuilding is underway. Moving on to pork, revenue was down nearly 7%, driven primarily by lower pricing due to softer global demand. AOI for the quarter was a modest loss, but importantly it increased by more than $40 million year-over-year and by more than $60 million sequentially as spreads improved along with operating performance. Before moving to our capital priorities, it's worth noting that our international business posted solid Q4 and fiscal '23 results, driven by growing penetration across our key markets and channels. We remain focused on market share growth and continued operational excellence, as we ramp up our new facilities. Now to our financial position and capital priorities, where building financial strength, investing in our business, and returning cash to shareholders primarily via our dividend remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. As Donnie said earlier, we will remain disciplined and prudent with capital. We came into fiscal '23 with a plan to spend roughly $2.5 billion dollars in CapEx. As you saw, we ended up reducing our spend by $600 million, as we reacted to market conditions driving lower profitability and impacting our operating cash flow. We were also disciplined in managing working capital, which was a source of cash this year. We ended the year with $3 billion of liquidity and net leverage of just over four times. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment grade credit rating, and returning to net leverage of at or below two times net debt to EBITDA. During the year, we returned $670 million to shareholders via dividends and $354 million in share repurchases, primarily to offset dilution. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now, let's review our outlook for fiscal 2024. Fiscal '23 was a challenging year, and we took a hard look at how we managed the business in times like these and how we can better communicate and manage expectations for investors. Our focus for fiscal '24 is to manage the business for profit and cash dollar generation. These are our internal goals and what we want investors to understand. So for this year, as you'll see, we are giving guidance in dollar terms instead of a margin percentage. While there are some top-line uncertainties within the individual protein categories, we expect our overall sales to be approximately in line with fiscal '23. Moving on to the segments, prepared foods has been solid and stable driver of operating cash flow. We expect that to continue in fiscal '24, driven by volume growth, disciplined revenue management, and productivity offset by MAP support for our brands and the start-up costs for our new facilities, as well as risks from changes in consumer behavior. Reflecting these dynamics, our expectations for adjusted operating income is in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. To help navigate any potential shifts in consumer spending and sentiment, we are focused on the most efficient marketing, advertising and promotions that drive the highest ROI and the most effective consumer engagement and demand. To help meet demand in value-added brands and categories, we had previously invested in new capacity and we expect to incur start-up costs in fiscal '24. On to chicken, our operational turnaround in chicken is progressing as we expected. We demonstrated sequential profit improvement in Q3 and again in Q4. We anticipate operational improvements to continue into next year and that along with lower input costs net of pass-through pricing, the segment should generate between $400 million and $700 million of adjusted operating income. Now onto our beef segment, when and how fast meaningful heifer retention will take hold is uncertain at this point, and this influences our outlook for our beef segment in 2024. Multiple outcomes are possible and we will be prepared for all of them to operate as efficiently as we can. Our guidance for this segment is a loss of $400 million to break even for the year, reflecting uncertainty in market dynamics. Now onto our pork segment, where we see momentum in the business. As spreads begin to improve and we continue to execute, we expect AOI to improve versus last year, to roughly break even for fiscal 2024. For the total company, we've given a range of outcomes for each segment, but we expect any outsized weakness or strength in any one area to be balanced by the remainder of the portfolio. In other words, neither the low end nor high end of the range is anticipated to happen simultaneously across all the businesses. As a result, we expect our total company, AOI for fiscal '24 to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion. To further help understand the shape of the year, let me provide some context on the quarterly phasing. While we foresee more typical seasonality in our business for next year, things like start-up costs and prepared foods and rising cattle costs will impact Q1 and Q2, and generally shift profitability to the back half of Fiscal '24. In addition, we are monitoring potential impacts to the consumer of higher interest rates and inflation, which could create some volatility. Now, to round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million for the year and our tax rate to be approximately 23%. We moderated our pace of CapEx in Fiscal '23 in a challenging environment. We ended the year with $375 million of expenditures in Q4, which annualizes to $1.5 billion. As we maintain tight controls in our spending in line with profitability and cash flow, we expect CapEx for the year to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion. While there are a range of possible outcomes for AOI, we expect to manage our working capital and CapEx so that we're free cash flow positive for the year. In summary, while the current operating environment remains difficult, we are making improvements across our operations, and remain optimistic on our long-term prospects. We have great teams, growing demand for our products, and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace. Now I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\nSean Cornett: Thanks, John. We will now move on to your question. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following. Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDonnie King: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: So I guess my first question, John, Donnie, I'd love to get a little bit more color as we think about the high and low end of the segment profit ranges in chicken, beef, and prepared foods, specifically, kind of, how do we think about what gets to the high and low end of those ranges? What do we think are the key year-on-year kind of profit drivers increases in chicken and decreases in beef in particular to help kind of narrow the range of kind of company-level outcomes?\nDonnie King: Okay. Adam, this is Donnie here. Thanks for the question this morning and thank you for being with us. As we said earlier, 2023 was a very unusual year, one that I've not seen, where all core protein categories were challenged at the same time. And at the same time, our brands continue to perform well, outperforming the broader food and beverage category. The demand for protein remains strong. We're controlling the controllables and we're focused on efficiency, modernization, and cost structure. Over this past year, we've taken bold actions to improve performance. We're managing the business for cash. We also have pulled down our capital spend and if you go back to '22, we spent $2.6 billion, in '23, we pulled that down to $1.9 billion and we're projecting between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in '24. We will continue to return cash to shareholders predominantly through the dividend and we shared that earlier today. We had the 12th consecutive year of increasing dividends. We're winning with customers and consumers. We do have advantage brands and advantage categories and are very proud to be in the Top 10 for the second year in a row with Kantar Power Ranking. We've seen sequential improvement across all the businesses in the second half of '23. We expect fiscal '24 to be better year-over-year in cash flow and profitability. Chicken AOI improving considerably and prepared foods continuing to perform well. In short, our plan is working and delivering tangible results. FY '24 is off to a great start and I could not be more excited about our future. We do have a good plan. We do have the right team, and we are executing at levels I've not seen in a long, long time. And in terms of individual segments, John, do you want to add something to that?\nJohn R. Tyson: Yeah, Adam, I think your question was around what gets you to the high or bottom end of the range in a few different segments. What I can tell you is in chicken, there's a few different things that will influence the profitability in the year. One, I think our plan, we have an aggressive operational improvement plan and so our range reflects some different timing on how we achieve that. We also expect timing benefits from the closures last year to roll through as we get into around the midpoint of the year. And then of course, there's just market movement that we can't necessarily predict, although I think recent market data would show you there's more tailwinds than there are headwinds in our chicken segment. On beef, the width of that range really just reflects the range of outcomes and the spread in that business. Naturally, we would expect that range to tighten as we move through the year. But just to comment on some of the movements in those markets, even Q4 for us that we just finished was better than we anticipated, you know, a quarter ago. So just acknowledging that there's a lot of movement there, and I think then on prepared was the last one you asked about, that'll be driven by execution, consumer demand strength, how we invest our brands, and how they perform. So I think that this range is actually by going to the AOI dollars, we've hopefully for you and all of our investors, kind of tightened up the band of outcomes here, but there is still some natural unpredictability in just how close we can nail the number.\nAdam Samuelson: And I think the AOI dollar guidance ranges are definitely appreciated versus the percent. And if I could give -- ask a follow up just on cash flow, so you said free cash flow positive, is that free cash flow positive after dividends or what's the big plugin there would be? How much working capital do you think you can release if given the sales and profit outlook that you have?\nDonnie King: Yeah, I think on working capital, the drivers will be pulling down some of the finished goods inventory, but we might give some of that back on inventory just in terms of the cattle prices and kind of what we've got on the balance sheet. As it relates to free cash deposit, we are committed to supporting the dividend for the year. And so we've given a range of CapEx numbers that we would expect to kind of reflect, wherever the AOI and EBITDA is, so that we can be free cash flow positive for the year.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay, I appreciate it.\nDonnie King: Okay. I think to clarify one thing is that would be net of -- that would not include any opportunistic M&A. I think we've always been pretty active in the market, evaluating opportunities. And so we don't have any predictions or news to share there, but just acknowledging that we'll consider things should they come to market during the year.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. I appreciate that color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Please go ahead with your question.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nDonnie King: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Strelzik: Good morning. I'd like to actually start on the CapEx guidance, please. If you could maybe unpack, how you landed where you did, what the buckets are? I think you previously talked about $1.7 billion, maybe getting as low as $1.5 billion over time. Obviously, this is lower than that. So, what types of things are removed from the plan? How does that shift and where do we go from here?\nJohn R. Tyson: Yeah. I guess, I'll give you three or four data points on how to think about CapEx. Number one, we communicated throughout last year, that we were trending towards a $1.5 billion number, did not mean to make any commitments last year as to when we got there, although we feel as though that's the high watermark this year. And so, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q4 was at $370 spend for us and so that would track out to being at the high-end of our range for the year. I think that the other -- the other two things, that are worth pointing out is, number one, we have a lot of capacity expansion projects that are rolling off and finishing up, as we start '24. And then last but not least, if you just think about a normalized investment level in our business, if I were to go back to before we embarked on this period of significant capital investment, [$1.25 billion] (ph) was probably the -- was the average number between I think '17 and '21, so that's just recent history that would support the range that we're sharing today is in line with what we need to invest in our business.\nDonnie King: Hey, John, if I might -- if I might add one thing to that, and you referenced some of the larger projects being behind us, I think it's important to remind everyone that in '22, we began to have an outsized capital expense. All of that was in service to making sure we had the capacity necessary to grow our branded portfolio, the value-added chicken, and prepared foods as well. And we've got those Danville, Virginia, we have Bowling Green, Kentucky, and Caryville coming online, plus a number of operations coming online outside the United States.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay, great. That's super helpful. And then a second question, I guess, is maybe, if you think about your footprint today, your capacity utilization across your business, and you've been very, very consistent in terms of saying that you're looking for all the opportunities that are out there and those types of things across the business. So you found some more in chicken that you've talked about. But I guess I'm just curious if you could characterize how you think about your footprint today and how you're evaluating those opportunities. If there's anything beyond chicken that you think might make sense at some point, or maybe not, since we haven't seen that yet, but just curious, as you continue to go down that path? Thank you.\nDonnie King: Sure. And as we've said a number of times, and we'll continue to say this, we are evaluating everything, leaving no stone unturned. If you go back and look at what we've announced thus far, the six chicken plants, and then most recently, the two value-added case-ready plants in our beef and pork business, those are typical of what we're looking for. But these are typically older, less efficient, certainly not modern that require a lot of capital expenditure to try to either expand or make efficient. So, we're choosing to move that capacity to another plant. We're not wanting to give up any volume or share, and we're doing that very well. But the other thing that may not be as quite as apparent is because of the efficiency play in all of our core plants, it has enabled us to run lines at rate. It's allowed us to get the labor and yield and throughput on those lines that we need. But that's also been an unlock in our ability to take away some redundant capacity.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thanks. I'll pass the line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask first, Tyson in the past has gone back and forth a little bit about providing longer term margin ranges by segment. Now that you're providing EBIT dollars by segment, and I would mirror, I think, Adam's thoughts about appreciating that. Is it possible that at some point in the future, you might consider going back to giving us some kind of longer-term EBIT ranges instead of margin ranges? Or is the goal to kind know, hey, let's see where the business goes, and then maybe that'll be considered? Or is that just kind of off the table at all? I know there's some people that just are always curious what your longer term outlook is at this point, you know, even though visibility is not great right now?\nJohn R. Tyson: Hey, Ken, this is John. And we appreciate the question. I think today we're not backing off of the long-term guidance, that we've got out there, but we're really focused on \u201824. And so, I think the time in the future when is appropriate and reflective of our high confidence on where things are, we will we will give revisions if we deem that to be appropriate or reflective of our outlook, but today we're really just talking about \u201824 and Q4 \u201823.\nKen Goldman: And then just as a quick follow-up. And thank you for that. It was mentioned that you're still, if I can paraphrase maybe kind of reviewing all of your options for your pork business, I was just curious, if there's any further insights you might be able to provide about what those options are and kind of where you are in that progress. Thank you.\nDonnie King: Thanks. I'll throw out a couple things and then I'll let Brady step on-top of that. If you look-back in \u201823 supply-demand imbalance, there is a little of that occurring in port as we as we move into \u201824. We talked a lot about controlling the controllable, but here's what I would tell you about that. The team that we've got in-place today in our Pork business is a world-class team delivering best-in class resorts, couldn't be prouder of the work that they've done. But they're also working across the lines with -- as it relates to Prepared Foods and trying to unlock new opportunity. We obviously have more Prepared Foods capacity coming online. Some of the Tyson pork raw-material will be in support of that. But we're looking at each footprint in terms of Capital requirements, how efficient, what it would take to make it modern and upscale it, but then we're looking at network and how to do that. But with that Brady, anything you would add to that.\nBrady Stewart: Thanks, Donnie. As Donnie indicated, we've seen improvement and John certainly in his opening remarks, talked about the improvement sequentially quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in our Pork business. Again, that's driven by two things, one is we did see some moderate improvements relative to the spread and we did see a significant improvement relative to us controlling our controllables. Again, that is a focus on making sure our assets, operating as efficiently as possible. Really focused on our mix and ensuring that we have world-class yields coming out of our assets as well. So when we talk about \u201824, again, we're looking at better than $100 million of improvements year-over-year relative to \u201923. We're excited about the team that we have. They continue to really use data and analytics and ID all of the opportunities in the business, they've developed the right strategies for the future. And most importantly, they've executed on continuous improvement in mix efficiency and yields.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to unpack a little bit on Prepared Foods and the guidance for the year. Donnie, just given your commentary and some of your competitors, it seems like there is a step-up in the [map] (ph) spending and some of the promotion and maybe the category -- some of the retail categories are getting more competitive. I just -- I was hoping maybe you could unpack that in the current environment and then kind of reconcile, again, the guidance for the year, typically, you would see a stronger profit contribution from Prepared in the first half versus the second half of the year, and maybe this year, it seems like it might be a bit different. So anything you can do more to get more detail there.\nDonnie King: Thank you. Let me say -- make a couple of comments, and I'll turn it over to Melanie. Let me start off by welcoming Melanie Boulden who is our Chief Growth Officer, and she has taken over responsibility for our Prepared Foods and she's on our first call today representing prepared foods. And Melanie, welcome. And let me just lay a little foundation, and I'll let Melanie close the deal. Prepared Foods is a key growth pillar for our future. Our brands continue to perform well, even last year, even in fiscal '23 when we were challenged. We have advantaged brands in advantaged categories. So we like that. But I'll let Melanie talk to you about some of the upside to even Prepared Foods today.\nMelanie Boulden: Hi, Peter. So let's first -- you asked about performance and wanting to kind of unpack that, if you will. Let's start with our performance in Q4. It's important to remember that the Prepared Foods business, it has some seasonality aspects that typically resulted in softer margins in Q4 compared with our full year expectations. But despite the seasonality and impact from our start-up costs this past quarter, our margins still remain -- our margins still increased year-over-year in line with our full year expectations. And as John pointed out, this past quarter, we generated -- it's been our second highest Q4 result in the past five years. And so then as I think about the full year, and our outlook for 2024, I have full confidence in the growth proposition of our Prepared Foods business. As we think about fiscal year 2024, we are driving profits behind disciplined revenue growth management and price pack architecture capabilities as well as we have strong operational improvement initiatives planned. And yes, to your point about that, we are investing for the future behind our business with increased math but we're also investing behind new highly automated industry-leading production facilities to increase our capabilities in service to meet our growing demand. But I do want to say, though, as I think about 2024, it's also important to note, just like we had in Q4, we still have some start-up costs in Q1 for our new facilities, and that's probably going to impact our profit.\nJohn R. Tyson: And Peter, if I can add one thing. Just to answer your question, we did not mean to indicate that the seasonality in Prepared would be meaningfully different than from prior years.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks, Melanie and John. And then Donnie, maybe just -- and I know we have Brady on the call as well, but a two-parter on Beef, I mean, it seems like you missed the window or the industry missed the window on kind of heifer retention for last year. Is that pushing out now another six to 12 months prior on beef cycle recovery versus kind of what you thought previously? And then -- the second piece would be, obviously, you're consolidating some of the case-ready operations that you announced last week. Historically, that was supposed to be a pretty big value driver in margining up the beef business over time. And just I want to make sure that, that's still kind of core to the strategy. And again, removing those plants or shuttering those plants doesn't kind of knock that off the rail. Thanks guys.\nBrady Stewart: Well, thanks for the follow-up there, Peter, this is Brady. And first, touching on the question relative to heifer retention. And I think a lot of industry analysts have continued to go back to where we saw diminished supplies almost a decade ago relative to the beef cycle. And certainly, the cattle on feed number relative to heifer as a percentage is extremely high. And we'll continue to monitor that. USDA indicated it was the largest on record for October. And so I think what we are looking at relative to the shape of the future certainly is maybe more of a U-shaped curve on the bottom end relative to supply as opposed to the V-shape we saw back almost a decade ago as well. So we will continue to monitor heifer retention and cows relative to production capabilities and supply and really prepare for the variety of outcomes to go. We've got a solution for really those variety of potential outcomes. Relative to our case-ready assets, I think there's a few key focus areas here. Number one is we did not lose any true capacity relative to our customers. All of our customers that we currently service today will be serviced in the future. We had redundant capacity. And so this just really allows us to continue to service our current customers, and we still have opportunity to grow into the future, but we're able to do that in a much more effective cost structure as well. So still a focus for Tyson is to get as close to our customers as we can relative to our value-added proposition.\nDonnie King: So if I could add a couple of things to that as well. I think it's important that when you're evaluating beef that you evaluated across the entire cycle, which is approximately 10 years. And I will tell you and this thing moves kind of quickly. But a year ago, I was testifying before Congress with some of my peers because Beef was making so much money. And today, we're talking about what it looks like on the downside. So my message there, and I have to tell myself this as well, is that you have to look at it across the cycle, and we do that. But a couple of other things that, again, I would just reiterate, don't miss the fact that we have redundant capacity and are able to shutter that, that don't miss the fact that we got better at what we do and every aspect of the operational component. And so we did. But we continue to evaluate all options, but something that Brady would never say, but I'll say because he won't that we have best-in-class assets. We have best-in-class team members. We have -- we are aligned with the right suppliers, and we have great -- we have all the great customers that you would want to service. So we have a number of things that are lined up against -- or lined up the right way for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead with your question.\nBen Bienvenu: Yeah. Thank you, good morning. John, a follow-up on a comment that you made around the Chicken guidance for next year. You noted the operational improvements you expect to make and I think the variability from the bottom end of the range for next year to the top end is subject to the pace of that progress. But you also made a comment about the market conditions that we can all see improving, is improved market conditions a variable that you're considering in guidance for next year for FY '24 in chicken?\nJohn R. Tyson: Yes, Ben. The answer to that question is, we do factor in some range of market conditions, although I would say in the band of our year-over-year improvement, it's probably about two thirds of that is what we're seeing from operations and one third of that year-over-year improvement has to do with some favorable grain prices and chicken market prices is how we think about that. And then I described earlier, obviously, how we get to the different outcome within the range. Wes is here with me, and maybe I can invite you just color a little bit more on the year, Wes.\nWes Morris: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ben. As John said, I classify it -- one-third of our improvements will be baked around markets, so grains, net of meat values, two-thirds driven by our fundamental improvements. And I'll give you some examples. Nice improvement in Q4 in our live production led by livability, fee conversion and hatch. Our capacity and our yields were both up, while turnover and absenteeism were down. Our service was up materially year-over-year, and we did it with $84 million less finished inventory pounds. And so trending in the right direction. We also have a very disciplined supply demand balance process in place. And so balance and supply demand and capacity to maximize profits while servicing customers. And so we're on track, improving our fundamentals, servicing customers and shifting our mix to drive profitability. But I agree with John, one-third markets, two-thirds performance.\nBen Bienvenu: Very, very helpful. Thank you. My second question is a follow-up question on the balance sheet for next year. As it relates to the $400 million of net interest expense in 2024, John, does that include the refinancing of the $1.25 billion of debt you have maturing in August? And/or is there something else that you guys might consider either downsizing that debt or something else to manage the balance sheet as you think about maturities in 2024?\nJohn R. Tyson: Yeah. So we'd be projecting to refinance any upcoming maturities. I think we also have a term loan that we executed earlier this year to draw in November. And so just the rebalancing of the portfolio and the combination of the fixed and floating is where you see the rate -- the total interest expense tick up year-over-year.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: For sure. Thanks so much. This is [indiscernible] on for Ben. Just a question for Chicken. In terms of your factory closure, I know there's two already closed or in process, can you confirm that? And also, what would you say is your current capacity utilization as of now? And then maybe any stats on reduced costs? Also, I just wanted to confirm for the $333 million write-down in fees, this relates to the two fresh meat case ready value-added facilities you said you took offline? Thank you.\nDonnie King: So let me start off, and I'll answer the Beef question first. The write-down in Beef doesn't have anything to do with that. That was discount rates, which drove the goodwill impairment. But in terms of Chicken, let me just state this because we've not said this in some time. Our goal in Chicken is to simply be the very best in this space. That hasn't changed. I can tell you that over the last three, four, five years, maybe we haven't done that to the best of our ability. We haven't competed very well. But we're getting more competitive, and we are still unlocking opportunities. And I'll let Wes share some of the things that he's doing in addition to what he's already said.\nWes Morris: Yeah. Let me see if I can answer your question. And so at this point, five of the six that we announced are in fact, are done producing with the last one coming offline at the 1st of March. In our Q4 financials, only two of those would have been driving those numbers with the remaining ones coming in Q1 and early Q2. As for capacity, yes, let me go ahead and I'll touch on the capacity. Our goal is to always have room to grow with our important customers, but we have moved up materially year-over-year with both the closures and other activities. But I would remind you that mix is as important as volume in driving our profitability across our total portfolio.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much.\nWes Morris: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to come back to -- you said your first priority was being disciplined with cash, but you also pointed out that you've raised the dividend. It's a modest increase. I realize that. But I guess why the rush to take it up at all? Is it just that time of year? Is there a reason -- with especially an outlook with a bit of uncertainty that you couldn't just put that on hold? So let me understand that thing and am I hearing correctly that it sounds like the flex comes from adjusting CapEx down? Is that the right trade-off? How should we think about that?\nJohn R. Tyson: This is John. I'll take that question. So as I mentioned earlier, we remain committed to growing the dividend, preserving dividend this year and growing it over time. I understand the question. I think our judgment was that on an absolute basis, about a 2% increase in terms of cents per share was modest and fit well within the range of outcomes for our capital allocation in '24. So I think that's how we answer that question.\nDonnie King: If I could add something to that in terms of CapEx. As a reminder, over the last couple of years, we've made major investments in capacity, and we're pulling that back down to normal levels. We are in a good spot today in terms of the capacity to produce and to be able to produce and grow in the near term here. We'll certainly keep our eye on that. But I think another way to think about that is you're just returning to more of a historical level of capital spend.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. And I just want to follow up on the Prepared Foods commentary. This has been touched on a little bit, but you called out the difficult consumer environment and how you're trying to meet those consumers where they are. I guess, just at a higher level. Can you give a sense of how you prioritize the sort of volume over price? What's the key driver in terms of how you think about approaching what could be a further step-up in promotions? Or just how you manage that going forward?\nMelanie Boulden: Yeah. So Michael, let me first talk about our pricing strategy in totality. So we have a strong revenue management capabilities as well as you know our leading brands, which is the foundation of our pricing strategy. And when we do implement price increases, we're focused on our profitability and the health of our brands, while at the same time simultaneously being cognizant of the category, our competition and our consumer demand dynamics. And through these capabilities as well as our analytics, we can see that our elasticities are moving back to pre-COVID ranges and level. And at the end of the day, as you know, our goal is just to balance pricing and volume in a volatile commodity market.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nDonnie King: Good morning, Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: So can I just start with Beef. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that it was going to be a year of two halves with more pressure on profitability in the first half. Obviously, this latest quarter came through a bit better than expected. and I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but are we trending at the moment towards the sort of lower end of the range, and the expectation is that things will pull around. And why would they pull around in the second half? Just curious about the magnitude of how it skews first half and second half.\nBrady Stewart: Sure, Alexia. Thanks for the question. And as we indicated, there is certainly a large range of outcomes, and there's a number of different supply and demand dynamics that will come into play as we move throughout the year. When we lay out our forecast and our approach, we certainly look at a variety of different inputs, including seasonality, where we see different demand behaviors from the consumer, along with what we see from a supply perspective and have balanced what we believe to be appropriate amount of heifer retention given the environment into those forecasts. And so really that provides us that range of outcome that we look at for \u201824. We've done a really good job from a business perspective of continual improvement, which we believe relative to the industry available spreads that we see lent itself to the performance in Q4, and we expect to see those trends relative to our true controllables, move into '24, and that has provided us with the range of guidance that we provided.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. Thank you. And then on leverage, it's kind of linked to the Beef question. I mean if there is going to be the sort of cadence through the year, do you anticipate that leverage is going to increase? And if so, by how much? Or how do you expect that to trend from here?\nJohn R. Tyson: Hey, Alexia, this is John. So we do would project for leverage to tick up a little bit as we move through the first part of the year. And really what's driving that is just lapping the quarters that we'll see from the first half of last year. And so once we move past them through that, we would begin to expect our leverage numbers to start to move back then.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time I'm showing no additional questions, we'll end today's question-and-answer session. And I'd like to turn the floor back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.\nDonnie King: Thank you. While fiscal 2023 was a difficult year for our business, we finished strong and are more focused, collaborative and efficient than we were 12 months ago. While we're not yet where we want to be, our plan and the decisions we have made are moving us in the right direction as demonstrated by a second quarter in a row of sequential improvements. In an uncertain macro environment, our priority continues to be controlling the controllables with discipline and agility. Our strategy is working. We have the right leadership team in place to deliver, and the bold actions we've taken are poised to drive long-term opportunity and shareholder value. Thank you, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John R. Tyson",
            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results, and then review our individual segments. Our sales were down year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal '23, driven by pork and chicken, where we saw a reduction in price per pound. The decline in adjusted operating profit for both periods was driven by lower profitability in beef and chicken. While profit in Q4 was down substantially versus last year, it's important to note that it continued to improve on a sequential basis and adjusted EPS more than doubled compared to Q3. Challenges remain, but we continue to drive efficiencies and improve our operations, and we believe we're headed in the right direction. Now, onto the individual segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, revenue was down modestly in Q4 year-over-year, driven by lower bacon pricing. This lower pricing was offset by volume growth, which highlights the strength of our brands. AOI improved slightly year-over-year, despite lower sales. Our ongoing productivity initiatives and easing inflation offset lower pricing, increased marketing, advertising, and promotional support, and the onset of start-up costs for our new facilities. AOI margin declined sequentially in Q4 due to seasonality, increased brand support, and start-up costs. However, the $151 million of AOI the segment generated is the second-highest Q4 result in the past five years. In the full year, fiscal '23, AOI grew by more than $100 million, representing growth of nearly 14% year-over-year. Now, moving to chicken, sales declined 10% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by lower pricing, reflecting primarily lower commodity protein prices. Volume grew modestly in Q4 versus last year, driven by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory, and this was partially offset by a decline in production. This decrease in production highlights our ongoing focus on balancing supply with our customer's demand. Year-over-year profitability declined primarily due to lower commodity chicken pricing, but this was partially offset by lower input costs and operational efficiencies. On a sequential basis, lower grain cost and productivity enhancements drove another quarter of AOI improvement. In fact, when we compare to Q4 to Q2, chicken AOI increased by more than $240 million. In beef, revenue increased modestly year-over-year in Q4, with lower head throughput offset by higher pricing. Operating profit was down, reflecting compressed spreads, primarily due to higher cattle costs. As we have been discussing all year, beef is likely to continue to face headwinds, including in fiscal '24, as we don't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until herd rebuilding is underway. Moving on to pork, revenue was down nearly 7%, driven primarily by lower pricing due to softer global demand. AOI for the quarter was a modest loss, but importantly it increased by more than $40 million year-over-year and by more than $60 million sequentially as spreads improved along with operating performance. Before moving to our capital priorities, it's worth noting that our international business posted solid Q4 and fiscal '23 results, driven by growing penetration across our key markets and channels. We remain focused on market share growth and continued operational excellence, as we ramp up our new facilities. Now to our financial position and capital priorities, where building financial strength, investing in our business, and returning cash to shareholders primarily via our dividend remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. As Donnie said earlier, we will remain disciplined and prudent with capital. We came into fiscal '23 with a plan to spend roughly $2.5 billion dollars in CapEx. As you saw, we ended up reducing our spend by $600 million, as we reacted to market conditions driving lower profitability and impacting our operating cash flow. We were also disciplined in managing working capital, which was a source of cash this year. We ended the year with $3 billion of liquidity and net leverage of just over four times. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment grade credit rating, and returning to net leverage of at or below two times net debt to EBITDA. During the year, we returned $670 million to shareholders via dividends and $354 million in share repurchases, primarily to offset dilution. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now, let's review our outlook for fiscal 2024. Fiscal '23 was a challenging year, and we took a hard look at how we managed the business in times like these and how we can better communicate and manage expectations for investors. Our focus for fiscal '24 is to manage the business for profit and cash dollar generation. These are our internal goals and what we want investors to understand. So for this year, as you'll see, we are giving guidance in dollar terms instead of a margin percentage. While there are some top-line uncertainties within the individual protein categories, we expect our overall sales to be approximately in line with fiscal '23. Moving on to the segments, prepared foods has been solid and stable driver of operating cash flow. We expect that to continue in fiscal '24, driven by volume growth, disciplined revenue management, and productivity offset by MAP support for our brands and the start-up costs for our new facilities, as well as risks from changes in consumer behavior. Reflecting these dynamics, our expectations for adjusted operating income is in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. To help navigate any potential shifts in consumer spending and sentiment, we are focused on the most efficient marketing, advertising and promotions that drive the highest ROI and the most effective consumer engagement and demand. To help meet demand in value-added brands and categories, we had previously invested in new capacity and we expect to incur start-up costs in fiscal '24. On to chicken, our operational turnaround in chicken is progressing as we expected. We demonstrated sequential profit improvement in Q3 and again in Q4. We anticipate operational improvements to continue into next year and that along with lower input costs net of pass-through pricing, the segment should generate between $400 million and $700 million of adjusted operating income. Now onto our beef segment, when and how fast meaningful heifer retention will take hold is uncertain at this point, and this influences our outlook for our beef segment in 2024. Multiple outcomes are possible and we will be prepared for all of them to operate as efficiently as we can. Our guidance for this segment is a loss of $400 million to break even for the year, reflecting uncertainty in market dynamics. Now onto our pork segment, where we see momentum in the business. As spreads begin to improve and we continue to execute, we expect AOI to improve versus last year, to roughly break even for fiscal 2024. For the total company, we've given a range of outcomes for each segment, but we expect any outsized weakness or strength in any one area to be balanced by the remainder of the portfolio. In other words, neither the low end nor high end of the range is anticipated to happen simultaneously across all the businesses. As a result, we expect our total company, AOI for fiscal '24 to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion. To further help understand the shape of the year, let me provide some context on the quarterly phasing. While we foresee more typical seasonality in our business for next year, things like start-up costs and prepared foods and rising cattle costs will impact Q1 and Q2, and generally shift profitability to the back half of Fiscal '24. In addition, we are monitoring potential impacts to the consumer of higher interest rates and inflation, which could create some volatility. Now, to round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million for the year and our tax rate to be approximately 23%. We moderated our pace of CapEx in Fiscal '23 in a challenging environment. We ended the year with $375 million of expenditures in Q4, which annualizes to $1.5 billion. As we maintain tight controls in our spending in line with profitability and cash flow, we expect CapEx for the year to be between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion. While there are a range of possible outcomes for AOI, we expect to manage our working capital and CapEx so that we're free cash flow positive for the year. In summary, while the current operating environment remains difficult, we are making improvements across our operations, and remain optimistic on our long-term prospects. We have great teams, growing demand for our products, and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace. Now I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. Yeah, Adam, I think your question was around what gets you to the high or bottom end of the range in a few different segments. What I can tell you is in chicken, there's a few different things that will influence the profitability in the year. One, I think our plan, we have an aggressive operational improvement plan and so our range reflects some different timing on how we achieve that. We also expect timing benefits from the closures last year to roll through as we get into around the midpoint of the year. And then of course, there's just market movement that we can't necessarily predict, although I think recent market data would show you there's more tailwinds than there are headwinds in our chicken segment. On beef, the width of that range really just reflects the range of outcomes and the spread in that business. Naturally, we would expect that range to tighten as we move through the year. But just to comment on some of the movements in those markets, even Q4 for us that we just finished was better than we anticipated, you know, a quarter ago. So just acknowledging that there's a lot of movement there, and I think then on prepared was the last one you asked about, that'll be driven by execution, consumer demand strength, how we invest our brands, and how they perform. So I think that this range is actually by going to the AOI dollars, we've hopefully for you and all of our investors, kind of tightened up the band of outcomes here, but there is still some natural unpredictability in just how close we can nail the number. Yeah. I guess, I'll give you three or four data points on how to think about CapEx. Number one, we communicated throughout last year, that we were trending towards a $1.5 billion number, did not mean to make any commitments last year as to when we got there, although we feel as though that's the high watermark this year. And so, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q4 was at $370 spend for us and so that would track out to being at the high-end of our range for the year. I think that the other -- the other two things, that are worth pointing out is, number one, we have a lot of capacity expansion projects that are rolling off and finishing up, as we start '24. And then last but not least, if you just think about a normalized investment level in our business, if I were to go back to before we embarked on this period of significant capital investment, [$1.25 billion] (ph) was probably the -- was the average number between I think '17 and '21, so that's just recent history that would support the range that we're sharing today is in line with what we need to invest in our business. Hey, Ken, this is John. And we appreciate the question. I think today we're not backing off of the long-term guidance, that we've got out there, but we're really focused on \u201824. And so, I think the time in the future when is appropriate and reflective of our high confidence on where things are, we will we will give revisions if we deem that to be appropriate or reflective of our outlook, but today we're really just talking about \u201824 and Q4 \u201823. And Peter, if I can add one thing. Just to answer your question, we did not mean to indicate that the seasonality in Prepared would be meaningfully different than from prior years. Yes, Ben. The answer to that question is, we do factor in some range of market conditions, although I would say in the band of our year-over-year improvement, it's probably about two thirds of that is what we're seeing from operations and one third of that year-over-year improvement has to do with some favorable grain prices and chicken market prices is how we think about that. And then I described earlier, obviously, how we get to the different outcome within the range. Wes is here with me, and maybe I can invite you just color a little bit more on the year, Wes. Yeah. So we'd be projecting to refinance any upcoming maturities. I think we also have a term loan that we executed earlier this year to draw in November. And so just the rebalancing of the portfolio and the combination of the fixed and floating is where you see the rate -- the total interest expense tick up year-over-year. This is John. I'll take that question. So as I mentioned earlier, we remain committed to growing the dividend, preserving dividend this year and growing it over time. I understand the question. I think our judgment was that on an absolute basis, about a 2% increase in terms of cents per share was modest and fit well within the range of outcomes for our capital allocation in '24. So I think that's how we answer that question. Hey, Alexia, this is John. So we do would project for leverage to tick up a little bit as we move through the first part of the year. And really what's driving that is just lapping the quarters that we'll see from the first half of last year. And so once we move past them through that, we would begin to expect our leverage numbers to start to move back then."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Earlier this morning, we announced our fourth quarter and total fiscal year 2023 results. In Q4, we saw another quarter of sequential improvements in our overall earnings, as we continue to make good progress in improving our performance. And I want to thank our team members for delivering these results in what continues to be a tough macro environment. Consumer demand for protein remains relatively stable and we are well-positioned to meet this demand, giving us confidence in our long-term prospects. Q4 also wraps up an unusual fiscal year for all of our core protein categories were challenged and yet one, where our Branded business delivered solid results, while we continue to see challenging market dynamics, our broader portfolio is set up well for the future. As we anticipated, our results continue to improve sequentially in chicken, with Q4 building on the momentum we gained in Q3 as part of a much better second half of fiscal '23, after a difficult start. Our brands continue to perform well and we grew market share across our core business line, outperforming our peers. This helped our Prepared Foods segment generate solid adjusted operating income in 2023. Market dynamics in beef and pork were challenging this past year, causing spread compression, although for different reasons. Despite these headwinds, our goal remains to be best-in-class operators, so that we can manage these businesses as efficiently as possible. We remain focused on what we can control. One of our priorities is to execute with excellence. Our operations have improved across the business and we have a long runway of opportunities to perform better. Controlling the controllable extends to capital allocation as well, where we will remain disciplined with CapEx and working capital. We continue to execute our multi-point plan focused on efficiency and modernization. You've seen us take bold actions to improve performance and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence and address inefficiencies. Our plan is working and we are seeing tangible benefits of our efforts to end fiscal 2023. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy and optimistic about our future. Rest assured, we are leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Let's dive into an overview of segment performance by starting with an update on market share. Our brands continue to outpace the broader food and beverage category in volume growth across the retail channel in Q4. Our volume grew, while the overwhelming majority of food and beverage peers saw volume declines. Our core business lines including the iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park, saw a Q4 volume growth of 3.2% versus last year, far outpacing our competition. Those four brands also all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete, delivering both pound and dollar share gains across our core business lines. We are accelerating foodservice, where our Focus 6 categories, including value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, pepperoni pizza toppings, bacon, and Philly Steak outpaced the broad-line industry in volume growth in the quarter both versus last year and sequentially. We have a strong foodservice portfolio and are aligning with key customers as we build momentum for the future. Speaking of winning with customers, we're proud to have made the Top 10 for the second year in a row in the most recent Kantar Power Rankings. In fact, Tyson, finished in the Top 10 in seven of the nine categories they measure, as we continue to focus on meeting customer needs and planning the future together with them. Moving to our segments, beginning with Prepared Foods. As I mentioned, our brands performed well in Q4, in fact, over the last year, nearly three quarter of US households purchased a Tyson core business line product, which is an increase of 90 basis points. While this is impressive across our portfolio, it's worth noting that our product with the highest penetration rate is only in about a third of households, leaving us room for continued growth. This performance in retail health Prepared Foods have a solid year in fiscal '23, with strong growth in AOI. As you know, our Branded Foods business is a strategic growth pillar for the future. We believe it is imperative to support our brands with marketing and advertising. As consumers began to face what could be a more difficult economic environment, we ramped up our math support for our brands in the second half of the year and will continue to do so as we move into fiscal 2024. While the full-year AOI for chicken was a modest loss, our progress toward improved performance continued in Q4, with sequential improvement versus Q3. In fact, this is the second consecutive quarter with more than $100 million in sequential AOI increases. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished over the past six months. Not only did we hold on to the operational enhancements we made in Q3, we made incremental improvements in yield and in our live operations. This allowed us to take advantage of improving market conditions, including lower grain costs, leading to a positive margin to end the year. As we head into the new fiscal year, we expect a better outlook for input costs, while we're seeing the benefits of some of the bold actions we took this year. Coming into fiscal '23, we expect it to be under pressure due to limited cattle supply. This trend held true, as cattle costs appreciated at a faster rate than the wholesale price of boxed pieces, eroding export opportunities due to a strong US dollar and low prices of competing exporters, and ultimately creating a very tight spread scenario. We also expected to see signs of rebuild of the herd to surface as cattle prices moved higher. However, this did not materialize. Until significant heifer retention and subsequent herd rebuilding takes place, we expect challenging supply conditions to remain. In this context, while the timing remains uncertain, we will be prepared by focusing on operational discipline. Moving to pork, as you know in fiscal '23 the industry suffered from supply-and-demand imbalances, which negatively impacted spreads. While we are seeing some signs of improving spreads and lower grain costs, there is still an imbalance between the supply and demand of pork. Our team is focused on running the business as efficiently as possible while continuing to review all the options. We saw significant sequential and year-over-year improvement in AOI in Q4, driven primarily by improving spreads and operational enhancements. Before I turn the call over to John to review our financials and FY '24 guidance, I want to give you my priorities for the coming year. First is improving our financial strength with a focus on cash. I want to emphasize that we will be disciplined and prudent with capital while remaining committed to our dividend as the primary way of returning cash to shareholders. As you saw in our earnings press release this morning, we increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year. We will continue to evaluate our production footprint and network to drive efficiencies. As you saw, we've made significant changes in chicken by announcing the closure of six of our older, less efficient plants, which we expect to improve our capacity utilization and mix. In a similar move to leverage efficiencies and reduce network redundancies, we also recently made the difficult decision to take two of our smaller fresh meat's case-ready value-added facilities offline. Production from these locations will shift to larger, more efficient plants, and our harvest capacity, sales volume, and importantly, our customers will see no impact. We are reviewing, whether there are similar opportunities across our segments. In chicken, we will remain focused on further enhancing our competitiveness going forward. Prepared Foods was the profit engine for the company last year. We want to sustain and build on ad strength by supporting our brands and driving momentum in food service while being responsive to changes in market conditions. Some of the key focus areas are making better use of our data, shifting more of our MAP support to digital media, and being disciplined with revenue management. In beef, multiple outcomes are possible during the current cattle cycle. We believe we have best-in-class assets and team members and are aligning with the right suppliers and customers, giving us confidence that we'll be prepared for all of them. In pork, we believe we have a bright future ahead of us and are excited about the team we've built that continues to drive operational improvements and synergies with our prepared foods business. As we said before, we're taking a hard look at our cost structure to drive operational excellence. Our ongoing productivity initiatives are focused on things that can be deployed at scale enterprise-wide, including procurement, logistics, and digitalization. These are a few of the initiatives that will make us a fundamentally stronger business as we go forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Good morning, Adam. Okay. Adam, this is Donnie here. Thanks for the question this morning and thank you for being with us. As we said earlier, 2023 was a very unusual year, one that I've not seen, where all core protein categories were challenged at the same time. And at the same time, our brands continue to perform well, outperforming the broader food and beverage category. The demand for protein remains strong. We're controlling the controllables and we're focused on efficiency, modernization, and cost structure. Over this past year, we've taken bold actions to improve performance. We're managing the business for cash. We also have pulled down our capital spend and if you go back to '22, we spent $2.6 billion, in '23, we pulled that down to $1.9 billion and we're projecting between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in '24. We will continue to return cash to shareholders predominantly through the dividend and we shared that earlier today. We had the 12th consecutive year of increasing dividends. We're winning with customers and consumers. We do have advantage brands and advantage categories and are very proud to be in the Top 10 for the second year in a row with Kantar Power Ranking. We've seen sequential improvement across all the businesses in the second half of '23. We expect fiscal '24 to be better year-over-year in cash flow and profitability. Chicken AOI improving considerably and prepared foods continuing to perform well. In short, our plan is working and delivering tangible results. FY '24 is off to a great start and I could not be more excited about our future. We do have a good plan. We do have the right team, and we are executing at levels I've not seen in a long, long time. And in terms of individual segments, John, do you want to add something to that? Yeah, I think on working capital, the drivers will be pulling down some of the finished goods inventory, but we might give some of that back on inventory just in terms of the cattle prices and kind of what we've got on the balance sheet. As it relates to free cash deposit, we are committed to supporting the dividend for the year. And so we've given a range of CapEx numbers that we would expect to kind of reflect, wherever the AOI and EBITDA is, so that we can be free cash flow positive for the year. Okay. I think to clarify one thing is that would be net of -- that would not include any opportunistic M&A. I think we've always been pretty active in the market, evaluating opportunities. And so we don't have any predictions or news to share there, but just acknowledging that we'll consider things should they come to market during the year. Thanks, Adam. Good morning, Andrew. Hey, John, if I might -- if I might add one thing to that, and you referenced some of the larger projects being behind us, I think it's important to remind everyone that in '22, we began to have an outsized capital expense. All of that was in service to making sure we had the capacity necessary to grow our branded portfolio, the value-added chicken, and prepared foods as well. And we've got those Danville, Virginia, we have Bowling Green, Kentucky, and Caryville coming online, plus a number of operations coming online outside the United States. Sure. And as we've said a number of times, and we'll continue to say this, we are evaluating everything, leaving no stone unturned. If you go back and look at what we've announced thus far, the six chicken plants, and then most recently, the two value-added case-ready plants in our beef and pork business, those are typical of what we're looking for. But these are typically older, less efficient, certainly not modern that require a lot of capital expenditure to try to either expand or make efficient. So, we're choosing to move that capacity to another plant. We're not wanting to give up any volume or share, and we're doing that very well. But the other thing that may not be as quite as apparent is because of the efficiency play in all of our core plants, it has enabled us to run lines at rate. It's allowed us to get the labor and yield and throughput on those lines that we need. But that's also been an unlock in our ability to take away some redundant capacity. Thanks. I'll throw out a couple things and then I'll let Brady step on-top of that. If you look-back in \u201823 supply-demand imbalance, there is a little of that occurring in port as we as we move into \u201824. We talked a lot about controlling the controllable, but here's what I would tell you about that. The team that we've got in-place today in our Pork business is a world-class team delivering best-in class resorts, couldn't be prouder of the work that they've done. But they're also working across the lines with -- as it relates to Prepared Foods and trying to unlock new opportunity. We obviously have more Prepared Foods capacity coming online. Some of the Tyson pork raw-material will be in support of that. But we're looking at each footprint in terms of Capital requirements, how efficient, what it would take to make it modern and upscale it, but then we're looking at network and how to do that. But with that Brady, anything you would add to that. Thank you. Let me say -- make a couple of comments, and I'll turn it over to Melanie. Let me start off by welcoming Melanie Boulden who is our Chief Growth Officer, and she has taken over responsibility for our Prepared Foods and she's on our first call today representing prepared foods. And Melanie, welcome. And let me just lay a little foundation, and I'll let Melanie close the deal. Prepared Foods is a key growth pillar for our future. Our brands continue to perform well, even last year, even in fiscal '23 when we were challenged. We have advantaged brands in advantaged categories. So we like that. But I'll let Melanie talk to you about some of the upside to even Prepared Foods today. So if I could add a couple of things to that as well. I think it's important that when you're evaluating beef that you evaluated across the entire cycle, which is approximately 10 years. And I will tell you and this thing moves kind of quickly. But a year ago, I was testifying before Congress with some of my peers because Beef was making so much money. And today, we're talking about what it looks like on the downside. So my message there, and I have to tell myself this as well, is that you have to look at it across the cycle, and we do that. But a couple of other things that, again, I would just reiterate, don't miss the fact that we have redundant capacity and are able to shutter that, that don't miss the fact that we got better at what we do and every aspect of the operational component. And so we did. But we continue to evaluate all options, but something that Brady would never say, but I'll say because he won't that we have best-in-class assets. We have best-in-class team members. We have -- we are aligned with the right suppliers, and we have great -- we have all the great customers that you would want to service. So we have a number of things that are lined up against -- or lined up the right way for us. So let me start off, and I'll answer the Beef question first. The write-down in Beef doesn't have anything to do with that. That was discount rates, which drove the goodwill impairment. But in terms of Chicken, let me just state this because we've not said this in some time. Our goal in Chicken is to simply be the very best in this space. That hasn't changed. I can tell you that over the last three, four, five years, maybe we haven't done that to the best of our ability. We haven't competed very well. But we're getting more competitive, and we are still unlocking opportunities. And I'll let Wes share some of the things that he's doing in addition to what he's already said. If I could add something to that in terms of CapEx. As a reminder, over the last couple of years, we've made major investments in capacity, and we're pulling that back down to normal levels. We are in a good spot today in terms of the capacity to produce and to be able to produce and grow in the near term here. We'll certainly keep our eye on that. But I think another way to think about that is you're just returning to more of a historical level of capital spend. Good morning, Alexia. Thank you. While fiscal 2023 was a difficult year for our business, we finished strong and are more focused, collaborative and efficient than we were 12 months ago. While we're not yet where we want to be, our plan and the decisions we have made are moving us in the right direction as demonstrated by a second quarter in a row of sequential improvements. In an uncertain macro environment, our priority continues to be controlling the controllables with discipline and agility. Our strategy is working. We have the right leadership team in place to deliver, and the bold actions we've taken are poised to drive long-term opportunity and shareholder value. Thank you, and have a good day."

            "name": "Brady Stewart",
            "content": "Thanks, Donnie. As Donnie indicated, we've seen improvement and John certainly in his opening remarks, talked about the improvement sequentially quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in our Pork business. Again, that's driven by two things, one is we did see some moderate improvements relative to the spread and we did see a significant improvement relative to us controlling our controllables. Again, that is a focus on making sure our assets, operating as efficiently as possible. Really focused on our mix and ensuring that we have world-class yields coming out of our assets as well. So when we talk about \u201824, again, we're looking at better than $100 million of improvements year-over-year relative to '23. We're excited about the team that we have. They continue to really use data and analytics and ID all of the opportunities in the business, they've developed the right strategies for the future. And most importantly, they've executed on continuous improvement in mix efficiency and yields. Well, thanks for the follow-up there, Peter, this is Brady. And first, touching on the question relative to heifer retention. And I think a lot of industry analysts have continued to go back to where we saw diminished supplies almost a decade ago relative to the beef cycle. And certainly, the cattle on feed number relative to heifer as a percentage is extremely high. And we'll continue to monitor that. USDA indicated it was the largest on record for October. And so I think what we are looking at relative to the shape of the future certainly is maybe more of a U-shaped curve on the bottom end relative to supply as opposed to the V-shape we saw back almost a decade ago as well. So we will continue to monitor heifer retention and cows relative to production capabilities and supply and really prepare for the variety of outcomes to go. We've got a solution for really those variety of potential outcomes. Relative to our case-ready assets, I think there's a few key focus areas here. Number one is we did not lose any true capacity relative to our customers. All of our customers that we currently service today will be serviced in the future. We had redundant capacity. And so this just really allows us to continue to service our current customers, and we still have opportunity to grow into the future, but we're able to do that in a much more effective cost structure as well. So still a focus for Tyson is to get as close to our customers as we can relative to our value-added proposition. Sure, Alexia. Thanks for the question. And as we indicated, there is certainly a large range of outcomes, and there's a number of different supply and demand dynamics that will come into play as we move throughout the year. When we lay out our forecast and our approach, we certainly look at a variety of different inputs, including seasonality, where we see different demand behaviors from the consumer, along with what we see from a supply perspective and have balanced what we believe to be appropriate amount of heifer retention given the environment into those forecasts. And so really that provides us that range of outcome that we look at for \u201824. We've done a really good job from a business perspective of continual improvement, which we believe relative to the industry available spreads that we see lent itself to the performance in Q4, and we expect to see those trends relative to our true controllables, move into '24, and that has provided us with the range of guidance that we provided."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Melanie Boulden",
            "content": "Hi, Peter. So let's first -- you asked about performance and wanting to kind of unpack that, if you will. Let's start with our performance in Q4. It's important to remember that the Prepared Foods business, it has some seasonality aspects that typically resulted in softer margins in Q4 compared with our full year expectations. But despite the seasonality and impact from our start-up costs this past quarter, our margins still remain -- our margins still increased year-over-year in line with our full year expectations. And as John pointed out, this past quarter, we generated -- it's been our second highest Q4 result in the past five years. And so then as I think about the full year, and our outlook for 2024, I have full confidence in the growth proposition of our Prepared Foods business. As we think about fiscal year 2024, we are driving profits behind disciplined revenue growth management and price pack architecture capabilities as well as we have strong operational improvement initiatives planned. And yes, to your point about that, we are investing for the future behind our business with increased math but we're also investing behind new highly automated industry-leading production facilities to increase our capabilities in service to meet our growing demand. But I do want to say, though, as I think about 2024, it's also important to note, just like we had in Q4, we still have some start-up costs in Q1 for our new facilities, and that's probably going to impact our profit. Yeah. So Michael, let me first talk about our pricing strategy in totality. So we have a strong revenue management capabilities as well as you know our leading brands, which is the foundation of our pricing strategy. And when we do implement price increases, we're focused on our profitability and the health of our brands, while at the same time simultaneously being cognizant of the category, our competition and our consumer demand dynamics. And through these capabilities as well as our analytics, we can see that our elasticities are moving back to pre-COVID ranges and level. And at the end of the day, as you know, our goal is just to balance pricing and volume in a volatile commodity market."

Now I'll turn the call over to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we review the results, I'd like to start out by discussing my vision for Tyson and the decisive actions that we're taking to successfully navigate the current market environment. We remain fully committed to our vision of delivering sustainable top-line growth and margin improvement over the long run.  With our leadership team, we're executing a multi-point plan focused on efficiency and modernization, including taking a much closer look at our cost structure across the business to drive operational excellence. We are already seeing tangible benefits of our efforts. We've been through market cycles before and I'm confident that we have the right strategy, seasoned leadership and team members in place to emerge stronger from this one.  We're making good progress and saw sequential improvements in our results in Q3. We're not yet where we need to be, so we continue to focus on what we can control. Earlier today, we announced our intention to close four more of our chicken facilities demonstrating our commitment to taking bold actions to improve performance.  Beyond these important actions, I remain optimistic about our future. We are a leader in our industry and we continue to innovate and take market share in most of our categories. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy, and we are leaving no stone unturned to maximize value for shareholders.  Diving into our results, we continue to compare against strong performance across our segments last year. However, I am encouraged by the sequential improvements we made in Q3. Let me start with Chicken. Market conditions in Chicken are still challenged with commodity prices across most cuts remaining significantly lower, compared to last year.  However, adjusted operating income improved by more than a $100 million of one choice without any material benefits as market tailwinds, these sequential increase was primarily due to internal actions we took. For example, in our fiscal Q2, we decided to close two of our plants convert two others to boneless and rationalized our SKUs, inventory, and other assets.  In Q3, the team made significant improvements in yield, spend and efficiency, leading to strong improvement in profitability in just one quarter. As we become more productive with automation and team member engagement, we can further optimize our footprint and reallocate resources to more efficient plants, while still having ample capacity to service and grow with our customers.  This enabled us to announce today that we plan to close four additional chicken facilities bringing the total announced closures to six this year. We also recently made the decision to transition away from the \u201cno antibiotics ever\u201d for Tyson branded chicken to a no antibiotics ever important for human medicine approach.  Data suggests the use of ionophores can lead to more uniform birds with consistent weight. In turn, we can more accurately forecast supply and demand helping to meet the needs of our customers and consumers. And I want to emphasize that we will continue to evaluate all options including more actions like these across all of our businesses.  And beef, we perform better than expected. Our results were driven by our disciplined approach to balancing supply with customer demands, while taking the advantage of seasonal increases in cutout values.  However, the beef industry will likely continue facing headwinds. As you may have seen in the latest USDA cattle inventory report, herd liquidation continues to tighten supply, leading to higher cattle cost, narrowing spreads and difficult export market conditions.  Pork remains under pressure across the industry and we continue to see headwinds there with both our internal live production and our external sourced hog supply, increased feed costs and low cut out Stroh spread compression through our results. We also had incremental negative impacts in Q3 from a fire at one of our processing facilities.  Finally, to Prepared Foods, which is a key growth pillar for the future. The business performed well in Q3. In Retail, our core business lines saw strong volume growth in the quarter and continue to gain pound and dollar share.  In Broadline Foodservice, Tyson Focus 6 continues to outpace the industry in volume growth. This led to better than anticipated margins in Prepared Foods. In short, our results this quarter demonstrates that Chicken is gaining momentum and our branded Foods business remains an area of strength.  Let me add some further color on the performance of our branded business versus our top peers. As I mentioned earlier, our Tyson core business lines, including the iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park continue to outpace total food and beverage, and our peers in volume growth up 5% versus a year ago.  We believe this points to the strength of our core brands and sets us up well for the future. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories, in which we compete, delivering both dollar and pound share growth in the aggregate and across day parts.  Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farms and Ballpark, all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin. Our share performance and brand strength demonstrates the momentum we've gained with consumers and they will continue to spend on brands they know and trust. Likewise, we will continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands. While we are pleased with our brand strength and share performance, we're constantly building new innovations to expand the appeal and market opportunities for our products.  Over the past few years, our innovations have generated roughly $2 billion in annual sales. Let me highlight a few products we've launched this fiscal year that I'm most excited about. Earlier this year, we announced that Tyson Original Chicken Breast Sandwich for retail channels, which won the People Magazine Food Award for Best Frozen Sandwich.  Furthermore, we were excited to see that more than 70% of the buyers were new to the Tyson brand and more than 20% were new to the category.  We also launched Tyson Chicken Sandwiches in Food Service space where our sandwiches won awards from Food and Beverage Industry, National Agri-Marketing Association, and National Association of Convenience Stores. As you can see, our innovation in chicken is able to be deployed across channels and occasions highlighting the power of our scale.  Moving to Jimmy Dean, which is already a clear leader in the breakfast meal occasion, we're expanding with differentiated capability-based innovation by launching handheld breakfast items. For instance, this year, we launched the Jimmy Dean biscuit roll-ups in Food Service channel and Maple Grill Cakes and Toaster Pop-Ups in retail. We're seeing strong customer adoption of these products and promising early consumer demand.  In Hillshire Farm, one area of focus in retail has been the trend towards healthy snacking. For instance, we launched Hillshire Farms Snack Kids with 100% real premium meats, cheeses and crackers, all ready to eat on the go.  If you haven\u2019t already, I encourage you to try our Snack Kids like Oven-Roasted Turkey Breast, Cheddar Cheese and Wheat Crackers. We launched these products at attractive price points and have already seen strong acceptance with major retail customers.  In the food service channel, we are now participating in the fast-growing Cupping Pepperoni category with our very own Hillshire branded Cupping Pepperoni product. We are always on the lookout for how to keep our brands on trend across channels.  Now, I'll turn things over to John to review our financial results for the quarter in more detail. \nJohn Tyson: Thank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results and then review our individual segments. Our sales were down 2.6% year-over-year, driven by pork and chicken where we saw a reduction in price per pound. More than 90% of the decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in our Beef and Chicken segments.  Higher input cost per pound was primarily due to the increase in cattle costs along with unfavorable derivative impacts and higher labor costs. But these were partially offset by lower hog costs, reduced outside purchase of meat in our Chicken segment and lower raw material costs in Prepared Foods.  While profit was down substantially versus last year, it's important to note that it improved meaningfully versus last quarter and adjusted EPS increased $0.19 on a sequential basis. Challenges remain, but we continue to improve efficiencies by controlling what we can and believe we're heading in the right direction.  Now, on to the individual segments results, starting with Beef. In Beef, revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with lower head throughput offset by higher pricing. Operating profit was down primarily reflecting higher cattle costs, which increased $610 million on a lines per pound basis. Operating margin of 1.6% was down from the historically strong, margins of more than 10% in Q3 last year.  On a sequential basis, disciplined yield and procurement benefits along with seasonal cutout improvement help drive better than expected operating profits. Beef is likely to continue to face headwinds and we don't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until herd rebuilding is well underway.  Now moving to Pork, revenue was down 18% driven, primarily by lower pricing due to software demand. The operating loss at the quarter was $70 million as spread compression continued to pressure our margins. This was exacerbated by market pressures in our live operations, lower exports and the operational impact of a fire at our Madison facility.  Moving on to Chicken now. Sales declined 3.5% year-on-year, driven by lower pricing, partially offset by volume growth. The decrease in pricing reflects the challenging commodity market. While volume grew modestly versus last year, it decreased more than 4% on a sequential basis. This sequential decline is more than historical seasonality reflecting steps we took to allow an internal production to consumer demand, while also reducing finished goods inventory by $70 million.  Year-over-year profitability was negatively impacted by market conditions and higher feed cost and a $65 million net derivative loss in the current quarter, compared to a $23 million loss in the prior year period. On a sequential basis, it's worth noting the AOI improved by more than a $100 million.  In Prepared Foods, sales declined 2.6% driven by both volume and price. The volume decline was driven by Food Service, as the trajectory of this channel\u2019s recovery remains a little uneven. As Donnie mentioned, our Focus 6 categories are outpacing broad line industry and maintaining their share. Our lower foodservice volumes were partially offset by continued growth in retail, highlighting the strength of our brands.  Lower pricing was primarily driven by lower bacon prices, reflecting the underlying cutout values for bellies. Compared to the prior year period, operating profit was up $34 million due to lower raw material cost and productivity gains, which was partially offset by lower sales, higher packaging cost and increased mass investments.  Despite increased spending and brand building efforts, we were pleased with our operating margin of 9.2%, particularly so given the challenging retail food environment. Our Prepare Food segment remains key to our strategy providing a high margin, stable business with many growth opportunities ahead helping to offset the pressures and volatility in commodity prices.  Before moving on to balance sheet items, I want to provide some context on the goodwill impairment charge that impacted our reported numbers on a GAAP basis, the details of which will be provided in our 10-Q when we file it later this week. The interim impairment testing we did this quarter resulted in non-cash charges in the reporting units that we have been disclosing is at risk in our filings going back to last fiscal year.  The impacts of the charges are not shown in our presentation this morning as they are not reflected in our adjusted results, but all reconciliations to reported results can be found at the appendix.  Now, to our financial position and capital priorities, we\u2019re building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy.  Q3 operating cash flow is $660 million, in line with expectations with prudent working capital management, partially offsetting lower profitability. Inventory reduction was the primary driver of improved core working capital. We still see some opportunity to improve inventory days and drive better cash flow. Year-to-date CapEx is roughly $1.6 billion and we continue to moderate our pace of spending.  Based on this pace, we don't expect CapEx to exceed $2.1 billion below our prior guidance of $2.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion of liquidity and net leverage of 3.2 x. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged, as we are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and targeting net leverage of at or below 2 x net debt to EBITDA for the long term.  During Q3, we returned $167 million to shareholders via dividends and $11 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.  Now, let's review our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. We're maintaining our total company sales guidance range of $53 billion to $54 billion and we expect to be at the lower end with roughly flat sales growth for the year.  Turning to AOI, in beef, based on our year-to-date results, offset by anticipated live cattle cutout spread compression, we expect full year margins to be at the higher end of our range of between a loss of 1$ and a gain of 1%. For Pork, due to ongoing market dynamics impacting our Pork segment, we now expect full year margins to be between a loss of 4% and a loss of 2%, but at the higher end of that range.  In Chicken, we're gaining momentum, but with our results year-to-date, including net derivative losses, we expect full year margins to be at the lower end of our range, but between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%.  Prepared Foods generated strong margins throughout the year with continued investment to support our brands, we expect margins to be at the higher end of the 8% to 10% range for fiscal 2023. And as I mentioned earlier, we're reducing our expectations for CapEx of approximately $2.1 billion. Our expectations for net interest expense and tax rate remained unchanged at around $340 million and 22% respectively.  So, in summary, while the current operating environment is difficult in several of our businesses, we are making improvements across our operations and we are optimistic on our long-term growth opportunities. We have great teams across our segments. We've got growing demand for our products and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace.  So, now, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. \nSean Cornett: Thanks John. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall, our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following QA. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  And our first question today, comes from Alexia Howard from Alliance Bernstein. Please, go ahead with your question. \nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone. \nDonnie King : Good morning. \nJohn Tyson : Good morning. \nAlexia Howard: Okay. So, there obviously a lot of moving pieces here on the quarter. Could we maybe take a step back, and get your overall take on the quarter and where we are at in the recovery of your commodity mix segments. Just trying to put things into context here and then I have a follow-up. \nDonnie King : Okay. Well, good morning, Alexia. This is Donnie King. Let me start out with thanking you for the question and there is no surprise markets continue to be challenging. And they're challenging for everyone. I will tell you that we continue to execute our strategy and I would tell you we've had for the best execution in our Q3 we've had since pre-pandemic times.  In Q3, we saw a sequential improvement across all businesses, led by Chicken, as well as - led by chicken as we focused on our cost structure. We have aligned our supply to our demand as we pursue profitable growth. We are controlling the controllables across all businesses. I would tell you that, we're not surprised by beef and pork results. We expected it.  We are happy to report that we're winning with customers and consumers and gaining volume and dollar share. We are taking decisive actions, as we talked about this morning, right-sizing and modernizing our footprint, we continue to invest in automation, and digitalization. We continue to invest in our team members and their work experience.  We are pursuing growth in value-added and branded categories. In Chicken, behind the number one brand in Chicken, Tyson; in Prepared Foods behind Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park. We are number one in eight of nine categories we compete in retail. We hold number one or number two positions in most food service categories. And as I said this morning, we will continue to evaluate everything we do.  Tyson has been around since 1935, and I've been around since the early 80s, and we've seen many cycles before. We always come out better, stronger, and faster and we will this time, as well. That's said, we have more to do and we're excited about our future. Our leadership team and all 140,000 team members are aligned to maximizing shareholder value. That's a little bit of color.  Let me flip it over to Brady as he can speak to a little bit around the Pork and Beef business \nBrady Stewart: Sure. Thanks, Donnie. First of all, on the Pork \u2013 in our Pork business, I think it's important to break the Pork business into two different segments. First, as John and Donnie indicated in the opening remarks, we faced some challenges relative to the economics in the Pork business, specific with live operations. It's well documented that the pork industry is in the midst of a liquidation cycle right now.  We believe that the markets will in fact, take care of themselves. But over a half of our losses in the quarter were attributable to live ops and price discovery relative to live ops with some of our suppliers. Fresh pork on the other hand, the other half of that segment was impacted by the fire we had in Madison. And outside of that, we saw strong improvement in terms of operational execution in our Pork business.  We're excited about the team that we've assembled here in Springdale, and believe we have a bright future in front of us as we continue to execute on those operations. On the beef side, we will continue to focus on what we can control relative to you moving through this beef cycle. We're going to continue to align our supply with demand and drive value-added including Kids Ready to make sure that we continue to be closer to our customer and try to decommoditize that business.  Thanks for the question. \nAlexia Howard: Great. And then, if I go back to a year, I mean, this time last year, you were looking for strong and speedy recovery in the chicken margin based on improved hatch rates and capacity utilization. Obviously, there was that the hiccup of the holidays with the forecasting error. But it seems as though the environment has changed materially. What has changed in the environment? And how quickly do you think you can get back on track on the Chicken side of the business? Thank you. And I'll pass it on. \nBrady Stewart: Thank you, Alexia. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in 3Q and especially in June. As we have much work left to do, but we're on the right path. And I think that's important to call out. We are controlling the controllables better than before and I mentioned earlier that the best I've seen in terms of execution since pre-pandemic. But let me flip that over to Wes and let him add a little bit more color on Chicken. \nWes Morris: Yeah, sure. I am too encouraged by the sequential improvement, the team is focused on what they do day in and day out. And we've seen a big step change in improving yields, labor efficiency, line efficiency, and spend. And at the same time, we've seen great improvement in order fill and on-time delivery. \nAlexia Howard: Thank you a lot. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question. \nBen Bienvenu : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. \nDonnie King : Good morning, Ben. \nBen Bienvenu : So, I want to start on the Chicken business. Donnie you noted the sequential improvement in the business. You also called out the actions you took too close four facilities. I recognize, not all of those are a lot kill harvest facilities, but I do think there's some sizable facilities and that put print.  So could you talk a little bit about what the net impact to production might look like as you layer some of that production into the rest of your facilities? And then, think about what the go forward looks like. \nDonnie King : Sure, Ben, I'll add a few comments and I'll flip it to Wes to add a little more color. In terms of the plant closings, closing plants is never easy for anyone involved. In fact it can be gut-wrenching. But I would tell you with a great deal of gratitude and thanks to our team members, our family farmers and the communities impacted, we made those decisions.  And earlier today, we announced the closure of the four plants bringing the total to six this year. The facilities that we're closing, just to give a little color about them, they're typically smaller in scale and in need of major capital to make them viable. And so, that's an important detail and I\u2019ll flip it over to Wes to give you a little color on the capacity. \nWes Morris : Yeah, Ben. I would answer it simply this way. We're moving our existing sales to more efficient assets and so, no material change in volume in any way, shape, or form and excess of 90% once implemented. \nJohn Tyson: Hey Ben, this is John, if I can just add in a little bit because I think you're trying to ask what the impact on these moves. So, you heard Donnie talk about adjusting the need for capital investments in some of the older facilities. We see that as a benefit with these moves. I think, number two, we're talking about taking out around 10% of harvest capacities, which puts our asset utilization when all things are said and done of closer to that 90%, out of the low 80s.  And not just talking about the asset closures, but when you think about the asset closures, the NAE to NAI, HM moves and some other operational changes that we're making, we talked a lot about in last year around on mix et cetera, we would expect somewhere around a $200 million runrate uplift from those moves.  And so exact to when all that comes to fruition in the end of \u201823 and \u201824, we can't pay it all in one day, but that's kind of order of magnitude what we're talking about here. \nBen Bienvenu : Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks. May be thinking about the Pork business. You noted the facility fire impact in the quarter, we have been seeing the cutout rally pretty materially. So kind of a two-part question, One, I know despite the guide down for the balance of the year in Pork, how would you expect Pork packer margins to migrate as we move through the rest of this year? And then, two, as you've seen, some of the cutout cost prices that rally pretty materially, what impact does that have to cost a goods sold on the Prepared Foods business, as well.  So, Ben, if I could make a couple comments and I'll let Brady add color to, Q3 was challenging and we expected it to be. As Brady mentioned earlier, we are absolutely laser-focused on those things, which we can control. I'll let Brady if you would speak to from the hog side, as well as from a Pork perspective. \nBrady Stewart: Okay, thanks, Donnie. I think there's a number of things at play here that we will continue to evaluate as we as we learn more about these markets. And obviously, one of the biggest impacts relative to the supply demand equation that we've seen in the last several months is the Supreme Court's ruling on proposition 12. I think as a industry, we're still learning what total impact that has from a supply demand perspective.  I think it's somewhat difficult right now to totally forecast with great accuracy. How that all plays out, coupled with the fact that, as I referenced earlier, we're in the midst of a sell liquidation, cycle as well in the industry. We're going to continue to monitor these macroeconomic factors that impact our business.  But let me be clear, we have the opportunity to continue to control the controllables, continue to use our footprint with our case ready and value-added assets to get closer to the consumer. And I feel good with the team that we have here in Springdale who stood up to manage the Pork business and are seeing significant operational improvements in that business. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. \nPeter Galbo: Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. \nDonnie King: Good morning, Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Donnie, maybe we can actually start on Beef. I think you said it came in better than you expected in the quarter. But again your outlook here in 4Q maybe a bit weaker. And I just wanted to give you a chance to talk about kind of how you see that business play out over the next 18 months, not asking for formal guidance, but I think the last time, we were in this part of the Beef cycle in \u201814 and \u201815 you went through an extended period where packer margins were actually negative. And is that in within your considerations that is that in your outlook just would be helpful to hear from you.  Let me start off with and we did, in fact have a better quarter than expected. We were not surprised necessarily by these results. As Brady is mentioned, and John did in the opening remarks, we continue to see herd liquidation. But we are focused on what we can control.  Let me, let me flip it over to John and let him add some commentary around this. \nJohn Tyson: Hey, Peter, just regarding your question on the Outlook, I think there is couple of things. So, you did know, right, just on what the implications are with our guidance ranges on the balance of our \u201823. And, we base that on dynamic market conditions. We're obviously being is as intentional and aggressive as possible and trying to balance that supply and demand to manage the spread.  But knowing what we know today that's where things sit. As we think about \u201824, we expect to give you guidance in November as has been customary for us in the past kind of annual cycles. But as it relates to making any projections looks like. As we move into the fall, we will start to see some data around where pasture conditions were, what are the herd numbers looking like? What is the cow harvest? And I think from there, at that point on in time, we might be able to make better projections about what \u201824 and \u201825 look like. And so I think that's probably as much as we can tell you on that today. \nPeter Galbo: No. That's helpful, John. Thank you for that just because kind of as we think about watch outs. And then maybe just back on chicken dies, just two questions or a two-part question. First is, with the four facilities you have today, are there any further anticipated impairments that you may have to take or kind of was that all contemplated today?  And then secondly, maybe more broadly Donnie, this mark-to-market hedging program in Chicken seems to kind of be an unexpected headwind over a lot of quarters. Just curious as you're re-evaluating, all parts of the business, I mean, is there a thought process on just unwinding the hedging program and kind of going to a more hand-to-mouth approach. Thanks very much. \nDonnie King: Sure. Thanks. Let me - in terms of the plant closures, as I said earlier, we're continuing to evaluate everything as we automate and modernize these assets. And so, we'll continue to look. I will tell you from an execution standpoint again, performance was much better in Q3 and a lot of momentum moving into Q4 in our chicken business.  We we're still growing with customers and we still have capacity to be able to do that going forward. So, but in terms of mark-to-market, I see it as well, we've talked about in a great deal at what the other options are for that in the business. Let me, let me send it over to John and let him add a little color about that. \nJohn Tyson: Yeah, I think there were two questions in there. One around the impairments and one around the mark-to-market program. I think on the hedging program, look, we, we manage that - try to manage for margin with for ourselves and as part of our relationship with our customers. We're always evaluating how we can do things different and better and recognize that they can create a little bit of noise in the numbers. But at this point in time, we don't have any plans to change our approach on how we do that.  So that's number one. And then on the impairment, I think it's just worth pointing out there were goodwill impairment in our chicken business in our Q3. But as it relates to these asset closures, the details of those charges would come through in our Q4 and we will give a little more clarity on that as relates to the asset impairments, and the one-time cash cost, which all continue to get work through as we work through the details with the quarter. \nPeter Galbo: Great. Thanks very much, John. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. \nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. \nDonnie King: Good morning, Adam,\nAdam Samuelson: Morning. So maybe just continuing in chicken and John you have some helpful color and quantifying how it benefits from some of the plant closures and production shifts on the business. And you quoted a $200 million kind of profit run rate that would equate to give or take 110, or 120 basis points to margin at your current revenue levels.  So, as we think about where you're exiting fiscal \u201823 with the business in a loss position, the cumulative effect of those actions would get you to functionally marginal levels of profitability. So help us think about beyond that. So these are things you can control and they get you slightly profitable. Is it really a market-dependent question on Chicken demand has to improve chicken \u2013 commodity chicken pricing has to improve is what would actually get you to those historical 5% plus margins that the company had been previously still aiming for a longer term? \nJohn Tyson: Yeah, and I think I would point out to a couple of things there. So, first off, we talking about the sequential improvements in operational execution. And more or less, you haven't seen market condition materially change quarter-to-quarter. So, I guess, we just do emphasize that as a proof point that we're talking about execution, but holding the external data mostly static we're starting to see that come through.  And you did picked up correctly on the 200 is kind of a run rate number. And again, when we talk about making the same amount of food in a smaller footprint, we do have some - we have confidence in just what that cost elimination means from an overall probability. But we obviously are subject to where commodity markets move on both the input and the market side.  So, recovery there helps us as it does everyone in the industry. So, we kind of focus on what's in our control and I think beyond, what I've just said is probably too early to issue any numbers for \u201924. Will give a look at that when we get to the November call. So, hopefully that's somewhat more helpful than what you're looking for. \nAdam Samuelson: No. It is. And I guess though, if I think philosophically historically, the company would always talk about profitability in Chicken and less volatility than the industry as a whole and not seeing the lows but others in the industry not seeing the same highs. And I guess I am not saying that others in the industry haven't seen real lows in the last 6 to 12 months. It\u2019s been a real challenge for the whole industry. I guess, the historical model would have \u2013 maybe think that Tyson\u2019s Chicken business would be more resilient.  So how does the experience of the last year kind of inform how you would think about the Tyson's relative performance versus the industry and the margin potential of the business is currently constructed? \nJohn Tyson: I let Donnie comment on that one. \nDonnie King: As I said earlier, Adam, we're - we believe in Chicken, we're on the right path. I would tell you it\u2019s the right path we've been on that path for about two years now, and we've had a number of fits and starts from the breeder side to a demand \u2013 with the demand picture. We're on our way to healing it from a genetics perspective on the live side.  In terms of our operations, they're performing better than have. But then the third one and it really impacted US in Q1 last year is the demand picture that we struggle with getting a really accurate view of that. I would tell you the good news is, in Q2, we were able to get that done. We actually started seeing benefits of that in Q3.  And so, we feel like we have a better picture of what the demand truly and consumption truly looks like and that informs us again in terms of supply. And so, we feel more balanced today than we have over the past two quarters and the executional elements that we've talked about. We're obviously doing those a lot better than before.  And then, if you look at the bridge that you're trying to create, it bases your question, yes, there are some asset impairments. Yes, there is some plant closures. There's, the typical labor yield and all those types of things that we're managing. But we are doing every one of those things. And so, I feel really good about where we are in Chicken and the path that we're on.  And the future looks really, really good to me. John? \nJohn Tyson: Yeah. And I also want to add and emphasize on what we already talked about. But I don't remember exactly how you asked your question. But something to the fact of hey, what's difference right now, we are looking backwards. And it's worth pointing out, I think we've taken pretty meaningful steps to get the cost structure back in balance that includes the two closures back in the March time frame, the NAE move that we've talked about, as well as these additional ones.  So I think just pointing to that as evidence and then, when you look at quarter-over-quarter market conditions are the same. We're delivering on the operational execution. There are multiple proof points in the last, call it nine to 12 months that I think we are and we believe are indicative of the trajectory on this business. \nAdam Samuelson: Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Please go ahead with your question. \nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is related to the Chicken facility closures that you just announced, but I'm wondering if you could, kind of compare and contrast the Chicken dynamics to what's going on in the Beef and Pork operating environment. You talked about controlling the controllables and utilization rates, and certainly struck by how difficult decisions are to close plants. But why does it make sense to do that in chicken and not across your beef and pork businesses given the supply contraction that you're talking about? \nDonnie King : Sure. Let me let me start out and remind you that I said we were looking at everything and we are. And so, I guess, your question around why not look at beef and pork? And again, I would tell you we are looking at everything in terms of how it works across the board. Fundamentally, we are focused on executional excellence across all businesses and functions at Tyson, including that overhead and cost structure at our corporate facilities. And so, we're doing that well. I'm not saying - I'm not telling you that we're not looking at Beef and Pork, in the same manner that we have looked at Chicken. We're evaluating everything. And I think that's probably the biggest takeaway from that. But there was a \u2013 the first part of that there was a chicken component. \nJohn Tyson: Yes. I think the specific question was comparing chicken to beef here. And how do you think about that? I think, look, there's multiple factors that go into making decisions like this. Asset efficiency and projected capital requirements are a big driver here. And when we talk about poultry today and we just think about the older kind slower less efficient assets, compared to where we're moving the birds, we see that as a big uplift. And we make those same kind of evaluations across the whole network if that would make the comparison there?  I think the other thing to point out, we've talked about this on previous calls. We are in this kind of special moment of facing headwinds in chicken, pork and beef segments. The recovery time line on each of those is different. We would expect to see chicken recover most quickly, pork is a little different and then, the beef cycle and those dynamics, I think are well documented. So it's just worth recalling attention to that we've discussed before. \nBrady Stewart : I would say this, John As one final thought. As we think about Chicken and you mentioned John, that chicken would recover faster and I think that's all true. But I think if you look at the chicken business today versus where we were just a quarter ago, there are more tailwinds than headwinds in the chicken business in the near to long term here. \nAndrew Strelzik: Great that that's really helpful color. And then, I guess, the second question, I just want to go back to the, to the change to the CapEx guidance for the year. Can you talk about some more specifically to change there does it have any applications for \u201824 CapEx? And I guess just generally as you think about the flexibility of your CapEx budget, is there a way, given projects that are already underway etcetera, to think about, kind of a minimum CapEx budget for next year? I don't know if there's a way to frame that. Thank you. \nJohn Tyson: Hey, this is John. I'll take that question. Let me talk a little about CapEx and just kind of maybe some other related matters on the balance sheet and leverage. So, I think, first off, we have tared back, the CapEx kind of quarter-over-quarter we\u2019ve been managing the spend throughout the year and we feel good about that.  Based on our guidance today, you would expect to see about $500 million in Q4, which just worth pointing out that\u2019s still above what has been a historical annual run rate for US of about $1.5 billion. We are targeting to get to that $1.5 billion spend annually. And I think it would be premature to say where the \u201824 number lands but safe to say that we're trending in that direction.  I think, it's also worth just taking a second to talk about where we are with leverage and because capital obviously capital spend, obviously influences that. I think, the headline for us is, we're sitting on a sound balance sheet. And that's really a product of the capital allocation choices we've made through the last few years where we're really focused on kind of preserving a good financial position, targeting at or around that two-time, leverage number for the long term.  So, leverage has increased with where profitability been on LTM basis. But I think overall, we feel good about where we are from being able to managing capital spend standpoint and everything else that we've got going on. We\u2019ve made a couple moves, just tried to be tighter on working capital. We pulled that down about $100 million in inventory this quarter just despite what's going on in the market.  So, I think overall, capital spend, working capital efficiency, all in line with long-term leverage number have been, we're comfortable with where we sit today. \nAndrew Strelzik: Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Benjamin Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. \nBenjamin Theurer: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about your pork margins have to be easily shown you already commented on market conditions, but can you provide more light of company-specific initiatives. Maybe some plant closure assessing maybe it could be an option, anything else if you can provide towards improving operations there? \nDonnie King : Hey, Ben, it's kind of hard to understand you muffled. Do you mind repeating that question? Sorry, because that was - there was a lot in there? \nBenjamin Theurer: Sure. On book margin, you already revised this, and market conditions, especially with sales, but can you provide more light on company-specific initiatives, maybe some plant closures? Could have be an option to invest in which you can anything else on pork to improve things? Thanks. \nBrady Stewart: Thanks, Benjamin. This is Brady Stewart. Appreciate the question. As Donnie just indicated, we're evaluating our business in totality. And first and foremost, really, I think we need to unpack those pork results back into the live and the actual fresh pork segments that roll up to the specific BEU. I'm going to speak specifically to our plants and operations from the fresh pork perspective. Very comfortable with our strategy moving forward obviously from a impact perspective, we're focused on everything from our expenses and expense structure that we have within our assets.  The efficiency of our assets we have plans in place to make sure that we focus on better efficiency within those assets. And then obviously, traditional price yield and mix matrices that really provide us the opportunity to maximize the margins and our opportunity to go to market. So, that's the approach we take. We feel very comfortable with the team we have in place. We will feel very comfortable with the strategy that we have in place. I feel very comfortable from an operational execution perspective that we're making strides and improvements in that particular segment. \nBenjamin Theurer: Okay. So no plants closures and expect kind of specific scenarios?\nBrady Stewart: As Donnie indicated earlier, we literally are evaluating everything. And that's both asset utilization, along with how we frame our strategy and our business moving forward. And we're comfortable with our approach as we move forward. \nBenjamin Theurer: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. \nDonnie King : Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question. \nMichael Lavery: Morning, thank you. \nDonnie King : Good morning. \nMichael Lavery: I just wanted to come back to Chicken and how you think about, I guess capacity. It's impressive to be able to cut some facilities and maintain the volume output is obviously from an efficiency standpoint. But I guess, just given the industry supply and where pricing is so pressured, is there any rationalization or kind of reduction beyond that that would make sense, just given the market dynamics? \nDonnie King : Sure, I think there's a couple things to say on that. I mean, we've been pretty consistent going back to the last year talking about capacity utilization as a driver for profitability in this business. And we were in the low 80s in \u201822. And so, with the balance of growing our business and rationalizing some of the footprint, we have feel as though we've now optimized the network and continue to push towards those utilization levels that would be in line with historical the drivers for profitability for us.  I think that's the first thing. And then, you talk about \u2013 you ask about just where demand is, or what the customer doing or the industry dynamics. We don't mean to make any projections about what's going on, the industry and focus on what we can control. And I think that with these move or going to get closer to our customers, which is a benefit with how we're moving things around and I think we feel good about the choices on that front.  I don't know if you got anything to add, Wes or John? \nWes Morris: Yeah, Michael, I think just as a reminder, we talk about it often that where our demand backwards slaughter production organization. And so, when you look at our customer forward demand curve, plus the business we picked, we're literally gaining momentum on both sides right sizing capacity and growing at the same time. \nJohn Tyson : And maybe I could add one additional thing to that, there's been a lot of conversation this morning about capital and what is that going to be going forward. But we obviously talked about the assets that we\u2019re closing. I think that what you may not understand is how all those fit together and so maybe I can help with that.  A couple of years ago, we have eat up intentionally in capital to get ourselves in a position to have capacity, specifically, more value-added branded type capacity. And so, that's where a lot of the extra spending above and beyond $1.5 billion. I think it's also important to link the plant closures that we talked about with a reduction in the capital that we're going to spend for the balance of \u201823 and probably what that looks like in \u201924.  That work is done today and these assets were shuttering would have required a significant capital in order to make them competitive. And if you look at the returns on those that did really didn't make sense to do that. But I would tell you, in terms of Chicken specifically in the capacity, with even with the 10% reduction, we're just over 90% capacity and we still have room to grow with the customers and as the market grows. \nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks so much. \nDonnie King : Thank you. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, I am showing no additional questions. This will conclude our question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks. \nDonnie King: Alright, thank you and thanks everyone for being with us today. As you've heard today, we're executing in the pace of macro headwinds and we're seeing early success demonstrated by the sequential improvement in Q3. I remain optimistic about our long-term outlook, our customers and consumers are behind us.  We're winning with both, while we remain focused on operational excellence and we will continue to combat the current environment by focus on what we can control, all in an effort to maximize value for shareholders. I'm very thankful for the hard work that our team members do every day to support these efforts.  As we continue to build a world-class organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us we remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. Thanks for your interest in Tyson Foods and we look forward to speaking soon. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Tyson",
            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. Let me start with a quick summary of our total company results and then review our individual segments. Our sales were down 2.6% year-over-year, driven by pork and chicken where we saw a reduction in price per pound. More than 90% of the decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in our Beef and Chicken segments.  Higher input cost per pound was primarily due to the increase in cattle costs along with unfavorable derivative impacts and higher labor costs. But these were partially offset by lower hog costs, reduced outside purchase of meat in our Chicken segment and lower raw material costs in Prepared Foods.  While profit was down substantially versus last year, it's important to note that it improved meaningfully versus last quarter and adjusted EPS increased $0.19 on a sequential basis. Challenges remain, but we continue to improve efficiencies by controlling what we can and believe we're heading in the right direction.  Now, on to the individual segments results, starting with Beef. In Beef, revenue was essentially flat year-over-year with lower head throughput offset by higher pricing. Operating profit was down primarily reflecting higher cattle costs, which increased $610 million on a lines per pound basis. Operating margin of 1.6% was down from the historically strong, margins of more than 10% in Q3 last year.  On a sequential basis, disciplined yield and procurement benefits along with seasonal cutout improvement help drive better than expected operating profits. Beef is likely to continue to face headwinds and we don't expect the ongoing tightening of cattle supply and spread compression to abate until herd rebuilding is well underway.  Now moving to Pork, revenue was down 18% driven, primarily by lower pricing due to software demand. The operating loss at the quarter was $70 million as spread compression continued to pressure our margins. This was exacerbated by market pressures in our live operations, lower exports and the operational impact of a fire at our Madison facility.  Moving on to Chicken now. Sales declined 3.5% year-on-year, driven by lower pricing, partially offset by volume growth. The decrease in pricing reflects the challenging commodity market. While volume grew modestly versus last year, it decreased more than 4% on a sequential basis. This sequential decline is more than historical seasonality reflecting steps we took to allow an internal production to consumer demand, while also reducing finished goods inventory by $70 million.  Year-over-year profitability was negatively impacted by market conditions and higher feed cost and a $65 million net derivative loss in the current quarter, compared to a $23 million loss in the prior year period. On a sequential basis, it's worth noting the AOI improved by more than a $100 million.  In Prepared Foods, sales declined 2.6% driven by both volume and price. The volume decline was driven by Food Service, as the trajectory of this channel's recovery remains a little uneven. As Donnie mentioned, our Focus 6 categories are outpacing broad line industry and maintaining their share. Our lower foodservice volumes were partially offset by continued growth in retail, highlighting the strength of our brands.  Lower pricing was primarily driven by lower bacon prices, reflecting the underlying cutout values for bellies. Compared to the prior year period, operating profit was up $34 million due to lower raw material cost and productivity gains, which was partially offset by lower sales, higher packaging cost and increased mass investments.  Despite increased spending and brand building efforts, we were pleased with our operating margin of 9.2%, particularly so given the challenging retail food environment. Our Prepare Food segment remains key to our strategy providing a high margin, stable business with many growth opportunities ahead helping to offset the pressures and volatility in commodity prices.  Before moving on to balance sheet items, I want to provide some context on the goodwill impairment charge that impacted our reported numbers on a GAAP basis, the details of which will be provided in our 10-Q when we file it later this week. The interim impairment testing we did this quarter resulted in non-cash charges in the reporting units that we have been disclosing is at risk in our filings going back to last fiscal year.  The impacts of the charges are not shown in our presentation this morning as they are not reflected in our adjusted results, but all reconciliations to reported results can be found at the appendix.  Now, to our financial position and capital priorities, we're building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy.  Q3 operating cash flow is $660 million, in line with expectations with prudent working capital management, partially offsetting lower profitability. Inventory reduction was the primary driver of improved core working capital. We still see some opportunity to improve inventory days and drive better cash flow. Year-to-date CapEx is roughly $1.6 billion and we continue to moderate our pace of spending.  Based on this pace, we don't expect CapEx to exceed $2.1 billion below our prior guidance of $2.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion of liquidity and net leverage of 3.2 x. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged, as we are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and targeting net leverage of at or below 2 x net debt to EBITDA for the long term.  During Q3, we returned $167 million to shareholders via dividends and $11 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.  Now, let's review our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. We're maintaining our total company sales guidance range of $53 billion to $54 billion and we expect to be at the lower end with roughly flat sales growth for the year.  Turning to AOI, in beef, based on our year-to-date results, offset by anticipated live cattle cutout spread compression, we expect full year margins to be at the higher end of our range of between a loss of 1$ and a gain of 1%. For Pork, due to ongoing market dynamics impacting our Pork segment, we now expect full year margins to be between a loss of 4% and a loss of 2%, but at the higher end of that range.  In Chicken, we're gaining momentum, but with our results year-to-date, including net derivative losses, we expect full year margins to be at the lower end of our range, but between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%.  Prepared Foods generated strong margins throughout the year with continued investment to support our brands, we expect margins to be at the higher end of the 8% to 10% range for fiscal 2023. And as I mentioned earlier, we're reducing our expectations for CapEx of approximately $2.1 billion. Our expectations for net interest expense and tax rate remained unchanged at around $340 million and 22% respectively.  So, in summary, while the current operating environment is difficult in several of our businesses, we are making improvements across our operations and we are optimistic on our long-term growth opportunities. We have great teams across our segments. We've got growing demand for our products and the right portfolio mix to win in the marketplace.  So, now, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. Good morning. Hey Ben, this is John, if I can just add in a little bit because I think you're trying to ask what the impact on these moves. So, you heard Donnie talk about adjusting the need for capital investments in some of the older facilities. We see that as a benefit with these moves. I think, number two, we're talking about taking out around 10% of harvest capacities, which puts our asset utilization when all things are said and done of closer to that 90%, out of the low 80s.  And not just talking about the asset closures, but when you think about the asset closures, the NAE to NAI, HM moves and some other operational changes that we're making, we talked a lot about in last year around on mix et cetera, we would expect somewhere around a $200 million runrate uplift from those moves.  And so exact to when all that comes to fruition in the end of \u201823 and \u201824, we can't pay it all in one day, but that's kind of order of magnitude what we're talking about here. Hey, Peter, just regarding your question on the Outlook, I think there is couple of things. So, you did know, right, just on what the implications are with our guidance ranges on the balance of our \u201823. And, we base that on dynamic market conditions. We're obviously being is as intentional and aggressive as possible and trying to balance that supply and demand to manage the spread.  But knowing what we know today that's where things sit. As we think about \u201824, we expect to give you guidance in November as has been customary for us in the past kind of annual cycles. But as it relates to making any projections looks like. As we move into the fall, we will start to see some data around where pasture conditions were, what are the herd numbers looking like? What is the cow harvest? And I think from there, at that point on in time, we might be able to make better projections about what \u201824 and \u201825 look like. And so I think that's probably as much as we can tell you on that today. Yeah, I think there were two questions in there. One around the impairments and one around the mark-to-market program. I think on the hedging program, look, we, we manage that - try to manage for margin with for ourselves and as part of our relationship with our customers. We're always evaluating how we can do things different and better and recognize that they can create a little bit of noise in the numbers. But at this point in time, we don't have any plans to change our approach on how we do that.  So that's number one. And then on the impairment, I think it's just worth pointing out there were goodwill impairment in our chicken business in our Q3. But as it relates to these asset closures, the details of those charges would come through in our Q4 and we will give a little more clarity on that as relates to the asset impairments, and the one-time cash cost, which all continue to get work through as we work through the details with the quarter. Yeah, and I think I would point out to a couple of things there. So, first off, we talking about the sequential improvements in operational execution. And more or less, you haven't seen market condition materially change quarter-to-quarter. So, I guess, we just do emphasize that as a proof point that we're talking about execution, but holding the external data mostly static we're starting to see that come through.  And you did picked up correctly on the 200 is kind of a run rate number. And again, when we talk about making the same amount of food in a smaller footprint, we do have some - we have confidence in just what that cost elimination means from an overall probability. But we obviously are subject to where commodity markets move on both the input and the market side.  So, recovery there helps us as it does everyone in the industry. So, we kind of focus on what's in our control and I think beyond, what I've just said is probably too early to issue any numbers for '24. Will give a look at that when we get to the November call. So, hopefully that's somewhat more helpful than what you're looking for. I let Donnie comment on that one. Yeah. And I also want to add and emphasize on what we already talked about. But I don't remember exactly how you asked your question. But something to the fact of hey, what's difference right now, we are looking backwards. And it's worth pointing out, I think we've taken pretty meaningful steps to get the cost structure back in balance that includes the two closures back in the March time frame, the NAE move that we've talked about, as well as these additional ones.  So I think just pointing to that as evidence and then, when you look at quarter-over-quarter market conditions are the same. We're delivering on the operational execution. There are multiple proof points in the last, call it nine to 12 months that I think we are and we believe are indicative of the trajectory on this business. Yes. I think the specific question was comparing chicken to beef here. And how do you think about that? I think, look, there's multiple factors that go into making decisions like this. Asset efficiency and projected capital requirements are a big driver here. And when we talk about poultry today and we just think about the older kind slower less efficient assets, compared to where we're moving the birds, we see that as a big uplift. And we make those same kind of evaluations across the whole network if that would make the comparison there?  I think the other thing to point out, we've talked about this on previous calls. We are in this kind of special moment of facing headwinds in chicken, pork and beef segments. The recovery time line on each of those is different. We would expect to see chicken recover most quickly, pork is a little different and then, the beef cycle and those dynamics, I think are well documented. So it's just worth recalling attention to that we've discussed before. Hey, this is John. I'll take that question. Let me talk a little about CapEx and just kind of maybe some other related matters on the balance sheet and leverage. So, I think, first off, we have tared back, the CapEx kind of quarter-over-quarter we've been managing the spend throughout the year and we feel good about that.  Based on our guidance today, you would expect to see about $500 million in Q4, which just worth pointing out that's still above what has been a historical annual run rate for US of about $1.5 billion. We are targeting to get to that $1.5 billion spend annually. And I think it would be premature to say where the \u201824 number lands but safe to say that we're trending in that direction.  I think, it's also worth just taking a second to talk about where we are with leverage and because capital obviously capital spend, obviously influences that. I think, the headline for us is, we're sitting on a sound balance sheet. And that's really a product of the capital allocation choices we've made through the last few years where we're really focused on kind of preserving a good financial position, targeting at or around that two-time, leverage number for the long term.  So, leverage has increased with where profitability been on LTM basis. But I think overall, we feel good about where we are from being able to managing capital spend standpoint and everything else that we've got going on. We've made a couple moves, just tried to be tighter on working capital. We pulled that down about $100 million in inventory this quarter just despite what's going on in the market.  So, I think overall, capital spend, working capital efficiency, all in line with long-term leverage number have been, we're comfortable with where we sit today. And maybe I could add one additional thing to that, there's been a lot of conversation this morning about capital and what is that going to be going forward. But we obviously talked about the assets that we're closing. I think that what you may not understand is how all those fit together and so maybe I can help with that.  A couple of years ago, we have eat up intentionally in capital to get ourselves in a position to have capacity, specifically, more value-added branded type capacity. And so, that's where a lot of the extra spending above and beyond $1.5 billion. I think it's also important to link the plant closures that we talked about with a reduction in the capital that we're going to spend for the balance of \u201823 and probably what that looks like in '24.  That work is done today and these assets were shuttering would have required a significant capital in order to make them competitive. And if you look at the returns on those that did really didn't make sense to do that. But I would tell you, in terms of Chicken specifically in the capacity, with even with the 10% reduction, we're just over 90% capacity and we still have room to grow with the customers and as the market grows."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we review the results, I'd like to start out by discussing my vision for Tyson and the decisive actions that we're taking to successfully navigate the current market environment. We remain fully committed to our vision of delivering sustainable top-line growth and margin improvement over the long run.  With our leadership team, we're executing a multi-point plan focused on efficiency and modernization, including taking a much closer look at our cost structure across the business to drive operational excellence. We are already seeing tangible benefits of our efforts. We've been through market cycles before and I'm confident that we have the right strategy, seasoned leadership and team members in place to emerge stronger from this one.  We're making good progress and saw sequential improvements in our results in Q3. We're not yet where we need to be, so we continue to focus on what we can control. Earlier today, we announced our intention to close four more of our chicken facilities demonstrating our commitment to taking bold actions to improve performance.  Beyond these important actions, I remain optimistic about our future. We are a leader in our industry and we continue to innovate and take market share in most of our categories. I remain very confident in our long-term strategy, and we are leaving no stone unturned to maximize value for shareholders.  Diving into our results, we continue to compare against strong performance across our segments last year. However, I am encouraged by the sequential improvements we made in Q3. Let me start with Chicken. Market conditions in Chicken are still challenged with commodity prices across most cuts remaining significantly lower, compared to last year.  However, adjusted operating income improved by more than a $100 million of one choice without any material benefits as market tailwinds, these sequential increase was primarily due to internal actions we took. For example, in our fiscal Q2, we decided to close two of our plants convert two others to boneless and rationalized our SKUs, inventory, and other assets.  In Q3, the team made significant improvements in yield, spend and efficiency, leading to strong improvement in profitability in just one quarter. As we become more productive with automation and team member engagement, we can further optimize our footprint and reallocate resources to more efficient plants, while still having ample capacity to service and grow with our customers.  This enabled us to announce today that we plan to close four additional chicken facilities bringing the total announced closures to six this year. We also recently made the decision to transition away from the \u201cno antibiotics ever\u201d for Tyson branded chicken to a no antibiotics ever important for human medicine approach.  Data suggests the use of ionophores can lead to more uniform birds with consistent weight. In turn, we can more accurately forecast supply and demand helping to meet the needs of our customers and consumers. And I want to emphasize that we will continue to evaluate all options including more actions like these across all of our businesses.  And beef, we perform better than expected. Our results were driven by our disciplined approach to balancing supply with customer demands, while taking the advantage of seasonal increases in cutout values.  However, the beef industry will likely continue facing headwinds. As you may have seen in the latest USDA cattle inventory report, herd liquidation continues to tighten supply, leading to higher cattle cost, narrowing spreads and difficult export market conditions.  Pork remains under pressure across the industry and we continue to see headwinds there with both our internal live production and our external sourced hog supply, increased feed costs and low cut out Stroh spread compression through our results. We also had incremental negative impacts in Q3 from a fire at one of our processing facilities.  Finally, to Prepared Foods, which is a key growth pillar for the future. The business performed well in Q3. In Retail, our core business lines saw strong volume growth in the quarter and continue to gain pound and dollar share.  In Broadline Foodservice, Tyson Focus 6 continues to outpace the industry in volume growth. This led to better than anticipated margins in Prepared Foods. In short, our results this quarter demonstrates that Chicken is gaining momentum and our branded Foods business remains an area of strength.  Let me add some further color on the performance of our branded business versus our top peers. As I mentioned earlier, our Tyson core business lines, including the iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park continue to outpace total food and beverage, and our peers in volume growth up 5% versus a year ago.  We believe this points to the strength of our core brands and sets us up well for the future. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories, in which we compete, delivering both dollar and pound share growth in the aggregate and across day parts.  Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farms and Ballpark, all hold favorite brand status with consumers over our nearest competitor by a wide margin. Our share performance and brand strength demonstrates the momentum we've gained with consumers and they will continue to spend on brands they know and trust. Likewise, we will continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands. While we are pleased with our brand strength and share performance, we're constantly building new innovations to expand the appeal and market opportunities for our products.  Over the past few years, our innovations have generated roughly $2 billion in annual sales. Let me highlight a few products we've launched this fiscal year that I'm most excited about. Earlier this year, we announced that Tyson Original Chicken Breast Sandwich for retail channels, which won the People Magazine Food Award for Best Frozen Sandwich.  Furthermore, we were excited to see that more than 70% of the buyers were new to the Tyson brand and more than 20% were new to the category.  We also launched Tyson Chicken Sandwiches in Food Service space where our sandwiches won awards from Food and Beverage Industry, National Agri-Marketing Association, and National Association of Convenience Stores. As you can see, our innovation in chicken is able to be deployed across channels and occasions highlighting the power of our scale.  Moving to Jimmy Dean, which is already a clear leader in the breakfast meal occasion, we're expanding with differentiated capability-based innovation by launching handheld breakfast items. For instance, this year, we launched the Jimmy Dean biscuit roll-ups in Food Service channel and Maple Grill Cakes and Toaster Pop-Ups in retail. We're seeing strong customer adoption of these products and promising early consumer demand.  In Hillshire Farm, one area of focus in retail has been the trend towards healthy snacking. For instance, we launched Hillshire Farms Snack Kids with 100% real premium meats, cheeses and crackers, all ready to eat on the go.  If you haven't already, I encourage you to try our Snack Kids like Oven-Roasted Turkey Breast, Cheddar Cheese and Wheat Crackers. We launched these products at attractive price points and have already seen strong acceptance with major retail customers.  In the food service channel, we are now participating in the fast-growing Cupping Pepperoni category with our very own Hillshire branded Cupping Pepperoni product. We are always on the lookout for how to keep our brands on trend across channels.  Now, I'll turn things over to John to review our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Good morning. Okay. Well, good morning, Alexia. This is Donnie King. Let me start out with thanking you for the question and there is no surprise markets continue to be challenging. And they're challenging for everyone. I will tell you that we continue to execute our strategy and I would tell you we've had for the best execution in our Q3 we've had since pre-pandemic times.  In Q3, we saw a sequential improvement across all businesses, led by Chicken, as well as - led by chicken as we focused on our cost structure. We have aligned our supply to our demand as we pursue profitable growth. We are controlling the controllables across all businesses. I would tell you that, we're not surprised by beef and pork results. We expected it.  We are happy to report that we're winning with customers and consumers and gaining volume and dollar share. We are taking decisive actions, as we talked about this morning, right-sizing and modernizing our footprint, we continue to invest in automation, and digitalization. We continue to invest in our team members and their work experience.  We are pursuing growth in value-added and branded categories. In Chicken, behind the number one brand in Chicken, Tyson; in Prepared Foods behind Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park. We are number one in eight of nine categories we compete in retail. We hold number one or number two positions in most food service categories. And as I said this morning, we will continue to evaluate everything we do.  Tyson has been around since 1935, and I've been around since the early 80s, and we've seen many cycles before. We always come out better, stronger, and faster and we will this time, as well. That's said, we have more to do and we're excited about our future. Our leadership team and all 140,000 team members are aligned to maximizing shareholder value. That's a little bit of color.  Let me flip it over to Brady as he can speak to a little bit around the Pork and Beef business Good morning, Ben. Sure, Ben, I'll add a few comments and I'll flip it to Wes to add a little more color. In terms of the plant closings, closing plants is never easy for anyone involved. In fact it can be gut-wrenching. But I would tell you with a great deal of gratitude and thanks to our team members, our family farmers and the communities impacted, we made those decisions.  And earlier today, we announced the closure of the four plants bringing the total to six this year. The facilities that we're closing, just to give a little color about them, they're typically smaller in scale and in need of major capital to make them viable. And so, that's an important detail and I'll flip it over to Wes to give you a little color on the capacity. Good morning, Peter. Sure. Thanks. Let me - in terms of the plant closures, as I said earlier, we're continuing to evaluate everything as we automate and modernize these assets. And so, we'll continue to look. I will tell you from an execution standpoint again, performance was much better in Q3 and a lot of momentum moving into Q4 in our chicken business.  We we're still growing with customers and we still have capacity to be able to do that going forward. So, but in terms of mark-to-market, I see it as well, we've talked about in a great deal at what the other options are for that in the business. Let me, let me send it over to John and let him add a little color about that. Good morning, Adam, As I said earlier, Adam, we're - we believe in Chicken, we're on the right path. I would tell you it's the right path we've been on that path for about two years now, and we've had a number of fits and starts from the breeder side to a demand \u2013 with the demand picture. We're on our way to healing it from a genetics perspective on the live side.  In terms of our operations, they're performing better than have. But then the third one and it really impacted US in Q1 last year is the demand picture that we struggle with getting a really accurate view of that. I would tell you the good news is, in Q2, we were able to get that done. We actually started seeing benefits of that in Q3.  And so, we feel like we have a better picture of what the demand truly and consumption truly looks like and that informs us again in terms of supply. And so, we feel more balanced today than we have over the past two quarters and the executional elements that we've talked about. We're obviously doing those a lot better than before.  And then, if you look at the bridge that you're trying to create, it bases your question, yes, there are some asset impairments. Yes, there is some plant closures. There's, the typical labor yield and all those types of things that we're managing. But we are doing every one of those things. And so, I feel really good about where we are in Chicken and the path that we're on.  And the future looks really, really good to me. John? Sure. Let me let me start out and remind you that I said we were looking at everything and we are. And so, I guess, your question around why not look at beef and pork? And again, I would tell you we are looking at everything in terms of how it works across the board. Fundamentally, we are focused on executional excellence across all businesses and functions at Tyson, including that overhead and cost structure at our corporate facilities. And so, we're doing that well. I'm not saying - I'm not telling you that we're not looking at Beef and Pork, in the same manner that we have looked at Chicken. We're evaluating everything. And I think that's probably the biggest takeaway from that. But there was a \u2013 the first part of that there was a chicken component. Hey, Ben, it's kind of hard to understand you muffled. Do you mind repeating that question? Sorry, because that was - there was a lot in there? Thank you. Good morning. Sure, I think there's a couple things to say on that. I mean, we've been pretty consistent going back to the last year talking about capacity utilization as a driver for profitability in this business. And we were in the low 80s in \u201822. And so, with the balance of growing our business and rationalizing some of the footprint, we have feel as though we've now optimized the network and continue to push towards those utilization levels that would be in line with historical the drivers for profitability for us.  I think that's the first thing. And then, you talk about \u2013 you ask about just where demand is, or what the customer doing or the industry dynamics. We don't mean to make any projections about what's going on, the industry and focus on what we can control. And I think that with these move or going to get closer to our customers, which is a benefit with how we're moving things around and I think we feel good about the choices on that front.  I don't know if you got anything to add, Wes or John? Thank you. Alright, thank you and thanks everyone for being with us today. As you've heard today, we're executing in the pace of macro headwinds and we're seeing early success demonstrated by the sequential improvement in Q3. I remain optimistic about our long-term outlook, our customers and consumers are behind us.  We're winning with both, while we remain focused on operational excellence and we will continue to combat the current environment by focus on what we can control, all in an effort to maximize value for shareholders. I'm very thankful for the hard work that our team members do every day to support these efforts.  As we continue to build a world-class organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us we remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. Thanks for your interest in Tyson Foods and we look forward to speaking soon."

            "name": "Brady Stewart",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Donnie. First of all, on the Pork \u2013 in our Pork business, I think it's important to break the Pork business into two different segments. First, as John and Donnie indicated in the opening remarks, we faced some challenges relative to the economics in the Pork business, specific with live operations. It's well documented that the pork industry is in the midst of a liquidation cycle right now.  We believe that the markets will in fact, take care of themselves. But over a half of our losses in the quarter were attributable to live ops and price discovery relative to live ops with some of our suppliers. Fresh pork on the other hand, the other half of that segment was impacted by the fire we had in Madison. And outside of that, we saw strong improvement in terms of operational execution in our Pork business.  We're excited about the team that we've assembled here in Springdale, and believe we have a bright future in front of us as we continue to execute on those operations. On the beef side, we will continue to focus on what we can control relative to you moving through this beef cycle. We're going to continue to align our supply with demand and drive value-added including Kids Ready to make sure that we continue to be closer to our customer and try to decommoditize that business.  Thanks for the question. Thank you, Alexia. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in 3Q and especially in June. As we have much work left to do, but we're on the right path. And I think that's important to call out. We are controlling the controllables better than before and I mentioned earlier that the best I've seen in terms of execution since pre-pandemic. But let me flip that over to Wes and let him add a little bit more color on Chicken. Okay, thanks, Donnie. I think there's a number of things at play here that we will continue to evaluate as we as we learn more about these markets. And obviously, one of the biggest impacts relative to the supply demand equation that we've seen in the last several months is the Supreme Court's ruling on proposition 12. I think as a industry, we're still learning what total impact that has from a supply demand perspective.  I think it's somewhat difficult right now to totally forecast with great accuracy. How that all plays out, coupled with the fact that, as I referenced earlier, we're in the midst of a sell liquidation, cycle as well in the industry. We're going to continue to monitor these macroeconomic factors that impact our business.  But let me be clear, we have the opportunity to continue to control the controllables, continue to use our footprint with our case ready and value-added assets to get closer to the consumer. And I feel good with the team that we have here in Springdale who stood up to manage the Pork business and are seeing significant operational improvements in that business. I would say this, John As one final thought. As we think about Chicken and you mentioned John, that chicken would recover faster and I think that's all true. But I think if you look at the chicken business today versus where we were just a quarter ago, there are more tailwinds than headwinds in the chicken business in the near to long term here. Thanks, Benjamin. This is Brady Stewart. Appreciate the question. As Donnie just indicated, we're evaluating our business in totality. And first and foremost, really, I think we need to unpack those pork results back into the live and the actual fresh pork segments that roll up to the specific BEU. I'm going to speak specifically to our plants and operations from the fresh pork perspective. Very comfortable with our strategy moving forward obviously from a impact perspective, we're focused on everything from our expenses and expense structure that we have within our assets.  The efficiency of our assets we have plans in place to make sure that we focus on better efficiency within those assets. And then obviously, traditional price yield and mix matrices that really provide us the opportunity to maximize the margins and our opportunity to go to market. So, that's the approach we take. We feel very comfortable with the team we have in place. We will feel very comfortable with the strategy that we have in place. I feel very comfortable from an operational execution perspective that we're making strides and improvements in that particular segment. As Donnie indicated earlier, we literally are evaluating everything. And that's both asset utilization, along with how we frame our strategy and our business moving forward. And we're comfortable with our approach as we move forward."

Now I'll turn the call over to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Last quarter, we said that we expected Q2 to be tougher than Q1, and this quarter was definitely a tough one. As you will have seen in our release earlier this morning, results were weaker than expected and top line performance was mixed, particularly when compared to our strong performance last year. At the same time, we outperformed our large branded-food peers in volume and dollar sales and continue to gain pound and dollar share in our retail core business lines.  As I also said last quarter, I can't remember a time when our business faced the highly unusual situation that we're currently seeing, where all 3 of our core protein categories, Beef, Pork and Chicken are experiencing market challenges at the same time. This unusual confluence of issues continued in Q2 and directly impacted our results. I know that you watch the protein markets closely, and like us, know that there are many factors at play here that are macro in nature.  For example, Beef is cycling out of historically strong margins that were seen throughout most of fiscal 2021 and '22. Cutout values across protein complex are much lower than a year ago. Inflation has also remained elevated and persistent, which has dramatically impacted our cost. The current macro backdrop is clearly tough. We have a strong growth strategy and are bullish on our long-term outlook. We continue to implement our strategy, focus on the things that we can control and build upon the strong foundation we have in place.  Late last month, we announced important initiatives to simplify our structure and rightsize our team. These are a logical next step in our ongoing efforts to drive operational and functional excellence as we strive to be best-in-class in our industry. Last quarter, we talked about executional issues that we needed to improve and operational performance did get better. We set a high bar to execute with excellence and are making progress.  Despite our overall results, there were strong positive highlights in the quarter that serve as proof points that our strategy is working. As you know, our branded foods business is the key growth pillar for the future, and in Q2, the business performed well. These results were driven by the strength of our share position, especially for our core brands, including Jimmy Dean, Tyson and Hillshire Farm, which helped deliver strong margins compared to the same 13-week period last year.  We continue to grow both pound and dollar share and to outperform our large food peers in volume based on Nielsen data. It's clear we are winning with consumers. We also continue to win with our customers. We're proud to have been moved up into the top 10 for the first time ever in the most recent Kantar power rankings. In fact, Tyson finished in the top 10 in 6 of the 9 categories they measure. As we continue to focus on meeting customer needs and planning the future together with them. While strong performance continued in our branded foods business, I know that our results in Chicken are top of mind for many of you. So I want to spend a few minutes walking through our Chicken business in detail. I want to point you to 3 important things on the macro environment.  First, marketing conditions remain very challenging. Commodity prices for most fresh chicken cuts are much lower than last year, with boneless breast meat, tenders and wings down more than 50%. While we're not fully exposed to commodity markets, we are not immune to their dynamics. Some might expect these dynamics to impact our results immediately. But in fact, they work through on a lag. As chicken commodity prices declined in Q1, the impact continued into our Q2, while price increases we saw during the quarter are expected to affect Q3. Second, input costs were higher compared to last year as our feed, ingredient cost increased $145 million. We also realized an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $135 million due to volatility in commodity grain prices. Third, while high-path avian influenza has not had a significant impact on our live operations, key export markets remain closed. While we can't control markets, we are focused on the things we can control. We made a series of strategic decisions to better position us for the future. For example, we converted 2 of our plants from bone-in to boneless, specifically to add new business and to continue growing with an important customer. We further rationalized assets, SKUs and inventory. In fact, we reduced our finished inventory pounds by nearly 20% during the quarter. We also made the difficult choice earlier this quarter to close 2 of our less productive chicken plants. These strategic actions are expected to generate significant efficiencies going forward, although some of them generate incremental cost in our current results.  Despite challenging market conditions, we continue to execute our strategy and have significant opportunities in front of us. We increased our internal production, gaining 130 basis points of harvest share compared to last year. This led to pound share gains of 250 basis points in value-added retail and 60 basis points in food service. As you can see, we are well positioned to keep growing. We continue to invest in automation and digital capabilities with opportunities to improve our yield. We now have 50 debone lines that are fully automated. We have room to optimize our cost structure and a portion of the actions we took last month are focused on this.  Importantly, we are working more closely than ever with our customers to create value jointly. We're building long-term supply partnerships that have clear benefits for both sides. We improved order fill rates by more than 20%. This was no accident, and I'm proud of our team for accomplishing this. We're winning in the marketplace by winning with our customers.  Now I've given you specific details on the business, I want to step back and remind you of our overall strategy. Our approach to building and growing Chicken is based on 3 key elements: first, we strive to be the best-in-class operator by executing with excellence. This includes filling our plants to continue increasing our capacity utilization. Second, we plan to grow our value-added business focusing on fully cooked in retail and food service channels and by innovating and differentiating our offerings. And third, we expect to win with consumers behind the #1 brand in Chicken and win with our customers by being their go-to supplier.  I want to underscore that we are focused on improving our results in Chicken. We can do that by implementing our strategy leading to continued growth and improved margins and I'm confident that we have the right leadership team in place to get us there.  Now turning to the continued strong performance of our retail branded business. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines continue to outpace total food and beverage and our peers in both sales dollars and volume growth, up 13% and 7%, respectively, compared to a year ago per Nielsen.  Our brands continue to perform well as Tyson core business lines grew pound share by 2.4 points relative to prior year quarter. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete, delivering both dollar and pound share growth in the aggregate by more than 2 points and also across all dayparts.  As proven by our growth compared to last year, we know that consumers will spend on categories and brands they know and trust. The trajectory of our Tyson core business lines volume share growth shows the momentum we have gained with consumers. We remain focused on maintaining our improved fill rates and on-shelf availability while investing in merchandising and advertising to support our brands, which, along with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in pound share growth increasing sequentially over the past 4 quarters.  Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, all hold favorite brand status with consumers by a large margin over our nearest competitor. It is evident that we're delivering the brands and products that consumers desire. As I mentioned earlier, our move into the Kantar top 10 demonstrates that we continue to gain the confidence of our customers. Winning with customers and consumers is a key priority, and it's clear we're having success with both.  Now let me tell you why I'm so optimistic about our future. Tyson is an iconic company with a broad portfolio of products and powerful brands that has been a recognized leader in protein for nearly 90 years. We've been through market cycles before. I've been through them before myself and we've always come out stronger on the other side. We have the right strategy, seasoned leadership and team members in place to do it once again. Our vision is to deliver sustainable top line growth and margin improvement. Our strategy to drive growth is built on the foundation of 3 key pillars: first, we will drive growth in our core protein platform where we harvest and process fresh meat across a diverse portfolio. We expect global demand for protein to continue to grow in the years ahead, driven by population growth and per capita income expansion. Tyson is well positioned with the capacity in place to meet demand.  Second, we will drive growth through our branded food portfolio. We have over 30 prepared food and snacking brands, including some of the strongest brands in all of food, namely Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. Branded food is our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margins and stronger results.  Third, we will expand internationally where it makes sense. Most of the growth in protein consumption is expected to take place outside the U.S. We can capture this significant opportunity by scaling our existing business, expanding our customer base and exploring new markets. These pillars are enabled by our relentless focus on customers and consumers, operational excellence and digital capabilities to drive margin improvement.  We win with customers and consumers by building growth partnerships, delivering top-tier customer service and fill rates and product innovation. We expect to realize our operational excellence goals as we modernize our operations, driving efficiencies, saving on costs and increasing throughput. And we continue to build our digital capabilities, operating at scale with digitally enabled standard operating procedures and utilizing data, automation and AI tech for decision-making.  With the combination of our growth strategies and focus on margin improvement, we can deliver the food that consumers love and create long-term value for our customers, for our team members and for our shareholders. We've put a strong proven leadership team in place here at Tyson. I've never been more confident in the talent that we have, and I know that we have the right people to capture the opportunities in front of us.  Now I'll turn things over to John to discuss our financial results for the quarter in more detail.\nJohn Tyson : Thank you, Donnie. First, for a quick touch on our total company financial performance and then a review of the individual segments. Total company revenue was up slightly compared to last year's previous record Q2 performance as the benefit from significant volume growth in Chicken were offset by the reduction in price per pound in Beef and in Pork. For the total company and individually in Chicken and Prepared Foods, we continue to deliver record high sales performance now for a fifth consecutive quarter. We remain focused on driving growth in these businesses to enhance our margin profile over time.  Now turning to profitability. More than 90% of the decline in adjusted operating income was driven by lower earnings in Beef and Chicken. Higher input costs per pound in all segments except Pork increased our cost of goods sold. The majority was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and labor costs. The remainder of the increase was due to a few things: inventory value adjustments, unfavorable derivative impacts and a shift producing more value-added mix and this was partially offset by savings from our productivity program, reduced outside meat purchases in Chicken and decreased supply chain costs. Our pricing decreased led by lower cutout values in Beef and Pork. This was partially offset by volume growth in Chicken.  Now let me go to the individual segment results, starting with Beef. Sales in our Beef segment decreased 8.3% compared to a record high sales in the second quarter of last year. Price was down 5.4% due to reduced domestic demand and softer export markets. and volume was down 2.9% due to fewer head processed. Live cattle costs increased approximately $305 million on a like-for-like volume in the quarter as the reduction in the beef cattle herd continues to tighten supply and increase competition for cattle. The margin compression resulting from reduced sales and increased cattle costs led to a segment operating income of $8 million and an operating margin of 0.2%, down from the historically high second quarter margin of 12.7% last year.  Looking next at the Pork segment. The volume gain of 1.1%, driven by improved hog availability was more than offset by the 10.3% decline in average sales price due to the soft global demand environment, leading to a decrease in overall sales of 9.2% versus the second quarter last year. The Pork segment posted an operating loss of $31 million for the quarter which was driven by the industry headwinds compressing pork packing margins and inflationary pressures on operating costs. Moving on to the Chicken segment results. The sales increase in Chicken of 8.4% over the prior year quarter was driven by a 6.4% uptick in volume due to increased internal production. Benefits of prior period pricing actions drove 2% growth in sales despite a challenging commodity market. At a loss of $166 million, second quarter operating income was impacted adversely by market conditions and near-term impacts of strategic decisions we made that Donnie discussed earlier. Other headwinds experienced in the quarter included continuing export impacts from HPAI as well as higher feed ingredient cost of $145 million and an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $135 million, including a $35 million loss in this current quarter and $100 million gain in Q2 of last year.  The industry operational headwinds do not change our approach, though. We expect to perform as the industry best-in-class operator while growing our internal production with our customer demand, enabling us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume and gain market share. In addition to the continuous improvement of our operations, growing the market share of our portfolio of value-added products is imperative to maximizing our profitability and our long-term strategy.  Now lastly, to Prepared Foods, where our retail brands like Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and State Fair continue to deliver industry-leading performance, outpacing all peers in both revenue and volume growth in the quarter. Total sales revenue grew 1.2%, primarily driven by pricing gains. The slight volume decline of 0.4% was driven by softness in food service volumes as the trajectory of this channel's recovery remains uneven. This was almost all offset though by the strong performance of our retail brands, driven by their category-leading position, improved supply and our MAP investments.  Compared to the prior year period, segment operating income decreased modestly due to increased raw material costs and brand building investments. This was partially offset by productivity gains and price increases. While down slightly against the historically strong comp, we are pleased with the operating margin performance of 10.4% in this challenging macro environment. We continue to be excited for the future in Prepared Foods as the segment is critical to valuing up Beef, Pork and Chicken commodity meat products and delivering strong earnings at a time when the commodity protein segment's profitability is under pressure.  We will continue to unlock value by increasing plant utilization, implementing productivity initiatives, and we will grow through innovation of new offerings, expansion of our existing product portfolio and the recovery of our food service business. Now to our financial position and capital priorities, we're building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy.  First, let me spend a minute talking about our financial policy and long-term capital allocation and provide a bit more color around our approach to CapEx deployment. Our financial policy remains unchanged. We are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and targeting net leverage of at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA for the long term. Our capital allocation prioritizes investing in our business through CapEx as well as strategic and disciplined M&A while also returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  As owner operators, our approach to CapEx is simple and effective, we support our maintenance CapEx needs and then we focus on growth and profit optimization, investing in opportunities that generate the greatest returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We don't expect our total CapEx this year to exceed $2.3 billion, which is down from our prior guidance of at or around $2.5 billion.  Now moving on from CapEx, during Q2, we returned $167 million to shareholders through dividends and $19 million in share repurchases. We have increased our dividend for 11 consecutive years and remain committed to supporting our dividend. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of liquidity and net leverage of 2.4x.  Last week, we entered into a new term loan agreement for $1.75 billion to further enhance our liquidity. These funds will be used to pay off our existing commercial paper that's outstanding and some upcoming bond maturities and also to fund our investments in the business, including the pending acquisition of Williams Sausage, which will support our strategic focus on branded retail growth. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now let's review our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. Based on performance year-to-date and a moderating outlook for revenue growth, we are lowering our total company sales guidance to $53 billion to $54 billion or flat to 1% growth for the year. In our Beef segment, based on the deterioration in current market dynamics, we now expect margins to be between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1% for the fiscal year. Also, due to challenging market dynamics this time in our Pork segment, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between a loss of 2% and breakeven. In Chicken, we now expect full year margins to be between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%, based on our results so far in April, we anticipate Q3 margins to be roughly breakeven as we gain momentum and exit the fourth quarter at or above the high end of the full year range.  In the second quarter, Prepared Foods continued its strong performance, resulting in a first half margin above the guided range for the fiscal year. So we are maintaining that at 8% to 10%, driven by historical seasonality and continued brand support. And in our International business, we remain committed to expanding globally in the fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. Driven by continued year-over-year volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up, we are confident of our improved profitability in fiscal 2023, with stronger quarterly performance in the back half of the year compared to Q2.  As I mentioned earlier, we're reducing our expectations for CapEx to approximately $2.3 billion. And our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $340 million and 22%, respectively.  In summary, the first half was challenging and many of the headwinds experienced are likely to persist for the remainder of the fiscal year. Although the current operating environment has proven to be difficult, we view this as an opportunity to grow and improve our business operations, and we are optimistic on our long-term value driver prospects. We have great leadership and operational teams, growing demand for our products, robust portfolio diversity and the differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders.  So now, let me turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. Thanks, Sean.\nSean Cornett : Thanks, John. Now we will move on to your questions. Please recall our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.\nBen Bienvenu: So my first question is a 2-part question on the Chicken segment. So first part of the question, in the quarter, results, obviously, were weak and considerably weaker than we saw, I think, in the broader market. Could you talk to a few of the things that might have contributed to company-specific weakness in the segment. And then as you look going forward, you talked about [Town Randall] margins being flat in 3Q, breakeven and then ramping into what all is incorporated into that assumption? Is it what we've seen already in terms of improvement in quality fundamentals? Do you need to take further actions around closing underperforming facilities or reducing inventory? And maybe just help us understand what's embedded in that expectation going forward.\nDonnie King : Okay. Ben, this is Donnie. I'll start off and then for the Chicken portion of this, I'll flip it over to Wes and let him add some detail to this. But I would say this quarter was not a surprise to us. We knew Q2 was going to be challenging and it was. I've talked about the fact that I've never seen this highly unusual situation where Beef, Pork and Chicken were all experiencing challenges at the same time. Many of these are macro in nature. But in Chicken specifically -- in Chicken, we have seen operational improvements and market recovery. While slower than expected, it will recover and of all of our businesses that are challenged right now, Chicken will recover first.  In the quarter, we had -- of our $166 million loss, $90 million of that came from 3 main areas. There was about 1/3 of it in mark-to-market, inventory adjustment, SKU rationalization accounted for about 1/3 of it and start-up costs associated with the mix change and improvement from bone-in to boneless plus a few asset impairments. So I would then go on to say Chicken remains a top priority for me. We have the #1 brand in Chicken. Our model doesn't give us the highs and lows of the commodity markets. That doesn't mean that we're not impacted by that and variable pricing model that we have in place, there are lags that go with that.  About 2 years ago, I laid out for you the plan that we had with our Chicken business, and we're following it. We're growing our volume and improving our mix. We sow what we harvested and we reduced inventory by 20%. And I would tell you that we are relentless on operational execution. We continue to invest in automation and digital capabilities and we will and do compete with the very best in the industry. We're winning in every area in which we play. We have market leadership in every category. Customers and consumers are key priorities for us, and it's clear we're having success with them. We've just recently announced that we moved up into the top 10 of Kantar for the first time ever on the most recent power rankings. We expect to win with consumers behind the #1 brand in Chicken and win with our customers by being their go-to supplier.  And I have confidence in the team that we have in our Chicken business. We have the right strategy and are doing the right things for growth. We continue to implement this strategy and focus on the things that we can control, and we'll build on this strong place -- a strong foundation that we have in place. Now with that, let me stop Ben, and let me flip this to Wes Morris, who leads that Chicken business and that team and let him add some additional color. \nWes Morris: Ben, thanks for the question. No question, Q2 was tough for us and for the industry as a whole. The combination of grains and markets -- some of the key parts being down as much as 50% and then the ongoing export opportunities. Simply said, versus a year ago, grain up 11%, price up 2% and then $135 million change in derivatives. We did something nobody else though, in the industry has done, growing net sales, 8.4%, volume, 6.4% and improving our capacity, 4%.  Based on published data, we competed actually better than an average company in the industry, and we kept investing at the same time. Donnie referenced the $90 million, I'd ask you to think at 2/3 of that as investments in our business going forward. The SKU rationalization and inventory adjustments, along with the packaging and ingredients makes us both more efficient and more consumer-centric at the same time.  So let me talk about 4 key areas that my team is focused on and give you some insight into what we got done in the quarter. The 4 key areas of people, service, growth and performance. Our plants were staffed for the entire quarter. Our teams delivered the volume we needed to win with customers and consumers. And we sold everything we processed plus another 100 million pounds. So demand for our products were good in Q2. Our service levels increased 20 points year-over-year, we're back to historical levels of service. We executed very well at the holidays of Super Bowl and March Madness, gaining share in both food service and retail. We continue to invest in Danville, fully-cooked location, which will come on this fall.  We're now filling over 99% of what we call our [core 8] retail products. And so winning with consumers and customers at the same time. Donnie referenced the 2 plants we converted in the quarter from bone-in to boneless. And then we announced the closure of 2 facilities, which will improve our efficiency while increasing our volume. And we've seen operational improvements every week in the last quarter and in April. So we're well positioned to win with customers, consumers and drive out cost at the same time going forward.\nJohn Tyson: And Ben, I want to just pick up on a couple of specific parts of your question there. I think, first off, you're asking, are there further actions that we're contemplating and just to address that directly, we're always looking at the footprint, but everything that we're doing is focused on growing our business today. And I would note that with the 2 announcements we made earlier in the quarter, we're still growing the business. You mentioned inventory too, part of working through, kind of some of the changing market conditions does mean continuing to pull down inventory. And so that will influence the outlook. But you noted correctly from the earlier remarks on kind of moving to breakeven and improving through the back half of the year is what we expect to see in poultry. \nBen Bienvenu: Okay. That's helpful color. Maybe shifting gears a little bit to the Prepared Foods segment. That's been a bright spot certainly for the first half of the fiscal year. The guidance for the balance of the year implies some margin moderation. I know you guys are focused on picking up some food service business that you lost and I think carries some lower margins. Is that key to what's embedded in the operating margin guidance for the balance of the year? And what are the potential sources of upside or downside to that expectation? \nStewart Glendinning: Got it. Let me pick up on that. We're pleased with the overall performance in the first half of the year. And I can see that we're making progress with both of our brands and our operations to improve margins. You're seeing that in the results. You're also -- by the way, you're seeing it in absolute dollars because I think if you looked at the first half this year versus last year, we're up about 10%. So all of that is good news.  If -- when you're looking forward, the shape of our year on a quarterly basis will look similar to last year in the sense that we expect a stronger first half than the second half and this is because of 2 things. First, because of normal seasonality in the business; and second, because we expect to have some higher brand investments behind our retail brands in the back half. That's important. Those brands are doing well. They have strong engagement with customers. And I want to make sure that we have continued investment to reinforce that. There is more work to do in food service. And in that space, the customer decision and contract cycles are longer. So it takes a little bit to win back that business. But we have a strong platform. We have good products, and I'm confident we're going to start to see the benefits of that improvement in the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. \nAdam Samuelson: Maybe my first question, just in Beef and taking kind of the revised outlook and it would seem to imply the business is operating kind of breakeven or a loss for the next couple of quarters. And I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that properly in the context of kind of industry packer margins, which, while certainly off their highs, are not negative. And just how do we then think about the implications of that into fiscal '24 and '25 candidly. And is cattle availability is just going to get worse progressively over the next couple of years, given kind of what we know about the cattle herd right now? \nDonnie King: Okay, Adam. Let me -- I'll start off and then I will pass it to Brady for some greater detail around that. But as expected in Beef that there was tightness in cattle [spot], we saw increased live cost and a softer export market. Probably the thing that is most interesting there, and unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to give you the answer to this, but it's around cow and heifer retention and we do have better, faster growing conditions. If you ook at Central Texas up to Nebraska, there still needs to be some more moisture. We saw cow harvest towards the end of the quarter began to decline. Some indication of the closure of the liquidation cycle. If you look at heifer feed numbers, we're not in a rebuild phase, just yet. More attention -- more retention is needed on the heifers before we're ready to signal that the rebuild has begun. So with that, Brady, you add some additional color, if you would. \nBrady Stewart: Thanks, Donnie, and thanks, Adam, for the question. I think there's a few specific call outs relative to standard industry gross margin calculations that we need to take into account during this specific time frame here in '23. And number one is while we still see export demand being relatively strong from a quarter-over-quarter perspective and versus prior periods, the opportunity for us to arbitrage our exports opportunities versus domestic with some cutout runs that have occurred in specific products has actually diminished our opportunity to capture some of those results from a Tyson perspective.  Number two is we've seen some pullback on drought credit values and again, versus the previous cattle cycle, we saw drought values are strong. However, from a quarter-over-quarter perspective, again, we saw some pullback as well that certainly impacts some of the calculations relative to gross margin.  And number three, from a brand versus choice perspective, we've seen a pullback in USDA data indicates that the spread between branded and choice actually decreased $4.3 hundredweight quarter-over-quarter from a sequential standpoint. So those are certainly some of the factors that are in our mind as we continue to look at the remainder of '23.  As we move into 2024 and beyond, in addition to the comments that Donnie made relative to the cycle that we're in, there's reasons for both challenges from an industry perspective relative to gross margin. There's also a reason for us to be optimistic. And number one, we'll absolutely be relentless in terms of operational excellence. And really, it's about Tyson and our team, controlling what we can control. The markets will do their job over time, but we have a world-class Beef business, and the expectation is we'll continue to perform at a very high level as we move through the cycle.  Number two is we have the opportunity to get closer to our customers and our consumers. We have capacity within our case-ready and value-added business, we've been working diligently to fill that capacity and feel very good and comfortable in terms of the future of that business to get closer to the consumer as well. So while there are challenges ahead relative to the markets, I feel we're in a very good position to weather those challenges as we move forward. \nAdam Samuelson: Okay. I appreciate that color. And maybe a follow-up for John Randal. You guys don't give a specific EPS or EBITDA guidance, but if I kind of roll through the revised sales outlook and kind of middle of the range on the different operating units, it would seem to imply that by the end of the fiscal year, net debt to EBITDA could be at or above 4x. Just want to get your perspective on -- given kind of your own earnings outlook kind of, if that's actually correct and kind of your comfort level of operating at that place for a period of time, particularly if Beef isn't kind of quickly reversing? \nJohn Tyson: Yes. Thank you for that question. And let me talk about the outlook and get a little more clarity on that, when we talk about leverage. I'm glad you asked this question. So if you look at the return on sales guidance that we've given kind of on a segment-by-segment basis, it could take a few different shapes. So a point I want to make sure that our listeners take away today is that when we look at a total operating income number for the second half of the year, we expect that to be in aggregate similar to or maybe slightly down compared to the first half of the year. So depending on the different movements within the various core proteins, that's kind of the net of it. We want to make sure lands from an outlook perspective. And as you suggested, that does have implications for what our total leverage ratio as we move into the back half of the year. And what I can say is we're focused in the long run on that 2x number, and I think just pointing to what we've done in the last couple of years, we were diligent in paying off $3 billion worth of debt. We've invested in the business from a growth standpoint, we've got new operations coming online and retail branded chicken, bacon and a lot of growth outside the U.S., aligned with our strategy. So I think while the timing on some of the capital expenditures, for example, kind of puts a pressure on the operating cash flows. I think we're comfortable with where we are and feel good about the outlook. I think that we know there's volatility in our business. Ratings agencies keep up with that. I mean, I can't speak for them this morning, but we're in constant communication, providing them outlooks about the business. So overall, we feel good, but yes, the leverage ratio will pick up for a little while. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. \nAndrew Strelzik: I guess I wanted to start on the Chicken side. And I'm curious, kind of philosophically how you're thinking about growth and which is clearly the focus on growing the volumes versus balancing that with kind of the medium-term margin outlook. Have you changed at all your expectations on the back half Chicken volumes that you would expect to realize and just kind of philosophically how you think about that? \nWes Morris: Andrew, this is Wes. Thanks for the question. First and foremost, we got to stay focused on our business and our customer expectations. And so we will, in fact, improve our capacity utilization over time. I think it's important to understand that our supply plan is actually our demand plan that we start with the demand plan and work backwards and as we see more demand for our products, we improve our capacity utilization. So hopefully, that answers your question. \nJohn Tyson: Yes. If I can add to that, though, I think you asked specifically about how do we balance the profitability versus the growth. And what I want to point out is that we've pulled down the total sales outlook for the business, but we're still projecting to grow from a volume standpoint. So I think the Chicken call compared to a quarter ago is still up, but slightly less than what we had initially projected just because of the demand that was referenced. \nAndrew Strelzik: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And if I could ask one also on productivity, obviously, have achieved the targets well ahead of your original expectations. How are you thinking about the productivity opportunity from here? I know there's a continuous improvement in mindset, but any way to frame kind of how you think about magnitudes of opportunity around productivity. \nDonnie King: Well, thanks for that question. It's still -- as we've said, I mean, we are continually focused on being the absolute best from an operations perspective. We want to be the best company, the best brand, the best protein wherever we choose to play. And what we're doing very simply is executing those things through productivity, through efficiency to deliver that. Some of that requires adding volume, for example, in Chicken. Some of that requires improved yield and labor utilization. It includes -- it also -- looking at the assets that you have and trying to make sure that we modernize those and invest in those and get the right footprint not only today but going forward. We'll do all those things and continue doing all those things. But the whole efficiency-productivity piece is top of mind for everyone in this organization today. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein. \nAlexia Howard : Sticking with Chicken, can I ask about the price -- the market pricing dynamics? I know obviously, last quarter, there was a challenge because there was an excess of chicken -- of fresh chicken flooding the market over the holiday period. I get the point that, that sort of bled into this quarter as well. Is there any visibility into how that might -- whether that might firm up in the second half of the fiscal year? Or where are we in that cycle? And then I have a follow-up. \nWes Morris: Yes. Sure. This is Wes. I'll answer that. We didn't see a lot of movement in January and February, and we started seeing a little more strength in March, which for us will flow through the next quarter. We have seen some pullet numbers that would indicate a little stronger markets in the back half of the year. \nAlexia Howard : Great. And then on to the Prepared Foods, with the Kantar PoweRanking study, I'm just wondering what it was that's changed in your retailer relationships because that is a big move. I mean, to get into the top 10, there's a lot of larger, more established, CPG-type companies that are not in the top 10. I'm just wondering what you think has changed over the last couple of years to have got you there. \nDonnie King: Thank you, Alexia. Well, first, I would tell you it was on purpose. We talked about very simply -- and the mantra around here is winning with our team members, creating a differentiated place to work, getting happy team members, having fully staffed operations was important and then winning with customers and consumers. We've invested a lot and continue to support customers and consumers with our brands, with innovation, with all those things. We want to be the best or be their go-to supplier in every part of our business. And then finally, and this is kind of where the rubber meets the road, but winning with executional excellence throughout this organization. And it is -- that is the result -- what you're seeing in this survey is a result of the work that this team has done. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. \nKen Goldman : I do appreciate, Donnie, your comments about the macro. Certainly, there's a lot of challenges that everyone is facing. I'm just -- I wanted to ask, it looks to me like, at least for this one quarter sort of the performance gap, as measured by margin did widen a little bit between the industry and Tyson in both Beef packing and in Chicken. I'm just looking at some of your bigger competitors in Chicken, and I'm just looking at sort of HedgersEdge and our own model for Beef margins. So I know those aren't perfect comparisons. But I'm just trying to get a sense of, a, is that how you guys see it as well? Or are my assumptions there wrong? And b, how quickly, if they are right, can we kind of reverse that and you can kind of get back to growing in line or having the margin in line with those kind of major segments. \nDonnie King: So Ken, I'll start off and then I will flip that to give a little more color from Wes around Chicken and Brady on Beef. But I did talk about the macro a lot. And I got to tell you, it pains me to talk about that because that we've never been able to control macro-economic issues or market conditions. But what I can tell you is we are controlling what we can. And we have a full-court press on being the best that we can be in operational excellence and winning with customers and consumers.  But the other thing I would tell you, Ken, is that here at Tyson and as you know, I've been through a number of these cycles before, this company has been -- in its 90-year history, has been through a number of them before. But what we have done in the past, and we're doing this time is we're accelerating in the bottom of this cycle, and we always come out better and stronger. And I see no reason to believe that we won't do that this time as well. And let me flip it to Wes to add some Chicken color. \nWes Morris: Yes, Ken. I think take into consideration the timing of how our pricing flows through is different than others. We have a further lag. Number two, the $135 million year-over-year derivative change and then the $60 million of the $90 million Donnie talked about in efficiency investment, I believe we competed better than the average in the industry. \nKen Goldman : All right. If I could ask another quick question. The Williams Sausage acquisition, I think we got a price today in the 10-Q of $200 million to $250 million. Could you give us a little bit of detail on what the expected revenues are, the last 12-month revenues? And sort of why now is the right time to do a deal, given some of the challenges you have in the balance sheet? \nJohn Tyson: Yes. This is John. Let me say a couple of things on that. First off, let me just make a shot out and thanks to the Williams family who we've got this transaction with, and we're grateful to them for entrusting 60-plus years of a family business to be part of the Tyson family. As it relates to the kind of contours of the transaction, let me answer the question why now. We're always being diligent and thoughtful about the M&A opportunities that we're pursuing. And I think this was a transaction that we got across the finish line based on the characteristics of the branded portfolio and the return profile. So when we close that in the coming months, we're excited to bring that into the Tyson Prepared Foods business. \nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Ken, let me just add a little bit here, this is Stewart. Look, this is a company with some great brands and some really great facilities and 2 things are going to come out of this. First, there are capabilities we're going to have because right now, most of our stock harvest goes through a single facility, this is going to provide some redundancy that makes sense for our business, particularly because Jimmy Dean is so important to the portfolio. And then second, when you look at the brands that are going to be complementary to our brands, along with a [DSG] network that, frankly, we haven't had in our portfolio before, I think we're setting up for a very interesting deal here that is going to be a good addition to Tyson. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. \nPeter Galbo : Maybe we can just start going back off of Ken's question, particularly around Beef. First, I think there's probably been some noise out there in the market that just shifts are being cut across kind of the entire Beef network and some of that maybe is due to the lower kind of harvest levels. But if you can kind of comment there.  And then secondly, Brady, I'd just be curious for your perspective, with cattle prices basically at all-time highs, in speaking to cow-calf operators, like what are the unit economics looking for them like in real time? How does that kind of change their decision-making process around retention or not? Because again, looking at the spreadsheet math, you'd think the price would be enough of an incentive, but obviously, a lot of their cost structure has probably changed as well. So I would appreciate any color there. \nBrady Stewart: Well, thanks for the question, Peter. First of all, let me address both the question that Ken posed and you posed as well around Beef. And I think there's a few important aspects of Q2 that we need to focus on. So first is relative to timing. Tyson has quarterly pricing that we use for several of our large customers. And so in very specific primal areas where we've seen some inflation from a cutout perspective in those primals quarter-over-quarter, we have a timing lag relative to those specific customers and agreements.  Second is we did see some hedging losses in the quarter that impacted performance. Third would be our volume. And so as you mentioned, we did see a decrease relative to volume. And so when we saw that volume -- we lost some volume leverage relative to our cost structure and our assets. We're working diligently from an efficiency perspective and seen some good improvements in that area as well to help offset that as we move forward. As I mentioned earlier, export demand has been softened. The strength of the U.S. dollar and FX has had an impact on some export demand and specifically the substitution products that we see from a domestic portfolio, we're not seeing those large gains as we did in previous quarters. That relative to drop value all go into play in terms of what our actual results are versus some of the index modeling that occurs as well.  And relative to the cow-calf operator and how they look at the business, obviously, a lot has changed since the last cycle. Interest rates are up right now. There is some incentives for the cow-calf operator to go ahead and market the heifer into feed yards as opposed to retain just relative to the strength we're seeing from feeder market as well. So we're still seeing some drought conditions from Central Texas up through Central Nebraska, that's creating some challenges, but the good news is for the cow-calf operators that are working outside of that space, we've seen some remedy relative to drought conditions and moisture here within the last several months that provides some optimism as well. \nPeter Galbo : Great. That's very helpful. And Donnie, I just wanted to go back to one of your comments, I think you did mention, I think, around Chicken that you took some asset impairments in the quarter. I'm not sure that I saw those in the Q. But just maybe thinking on a longer-term basis, look, Chicken has been a business where you've been quite acquisitive. I think the margin profile, self admittedly, has probably been a little bit weaker than you would have thought. Just as we kind of sit here today and go through the balance of the year, like how do we think about further impairment risk in that business particularly as the margin improvement even coming out of this year isn't expected to be kind of at your long-term average.\nDonnie King: Thanks for that question. I'll touch on this at a high level. But in terms of your question, for the past few years, we've taken bold and aggressive steps to advance productivity and efficiency. We're constantly evaluating how we can be more efficient, push down decision-making and remove duplication of [flows]. Those are all top of mind today. But we have also have done a number of things looking at our footprint, looking for what it would take to make our less efficient assets -- and this would be across the portfolio. How do we either make them efficient, how do we automate them, how do we redesign them or, in some cases, you could look at how would you sell it or how would you close it? And we look at all those different options.  But I want to remind you that our strategy is all about growth. Growth in our base or core protein businesses, growth in our branded portfolio and growth internationally where it makes sense. So making sure that you understand clearly that we are in a growth mode and at the same time, trying to rightsize our footprint in our production machines to deliver those products that customers and consumers love. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. \nBen Theurer : Just wanted to come back to Chicken in actually some of the like historic context and ask about your performance particularly as it relates to hatch rates and hatchability because it was interesting in the past, it seems like the performance itself was impacted by the very specific issues you were facing. We saw the industry relatively soft, I would say, in the last couple of weeks, but it feels like that your performance, at least from a volume perspective, has done better. So any comment you can share as to your own initiatives and improving that supply and then ultimately less need to buy outside. How do you feel about this? How was it in the last quarter? And how do you feel about it going forward? That would be my first question. I have a quick follow-up as well. \nDonnie King: Okay. I will start off and then I'll flip it for Wes for even greater level of detail. But I would remind you that a couple of years ago, I outlined a road map for us to, what I would call, restore our Chicken business to its rightful position. Those are my exact -- almost my exact words. And we're still on that road map. We've had bumps along the way, in live production, in the life cycle of the animals that we had some issues with some of the breeding stock, particularly the males are not -- has been well chronicled, everywhere.  We had issues with hatch and we're very competitive as it relates to that today. We've made lots of improvement. We've -- we were buying, if you recall, a significant amount of product on the outside and paying a premium in the height of the market. And we began to reduce our dependence on outside meat and wanted to utilize the assets that we have in place and get the fixed cost leverage by producing those live animals and then converting those into those products that our customers and consumers love. And we've done all those things, and we're still on this journey.  And I would tell you that we got the right people in place to complete that mission, not that you ever implied, but to continue down the road, a great leadership, a great team in place now to do that. And I'm excited. I'm optimistic about the future of our Chicken business and where it's going and even in this quarter, losing $166 million. I'm still excited about the future of the #1 brand in Chicken and the opportunity that we still have before us. Wes? \nWes Morris: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. The whole industry is not seeing the kind of hatch rates we saw 4 or 5 years ago. Ours, in particular, is down a few points from Q1, but not near the volatility that we're seeing in the industry as a whole. And so we have a more stable, predictable supply chain to include our hatch rate that makes it easier to manage going forward. As for outside buy, we'll continue to buy and grow as we have fluctuations in our demand, but much more imbalanced than in years passed. \nBen Theurer : Perfect. And then just a second question just around capital allocation. Obviously, you've reduced the CapEx a little bit, but at the same time, because of the loan, you got a little higher interest. You did some share repurchases throughout the quarter. How should we think about for the balance of the year also in light of what Adam pointed out as leverage could go somewhere north of 4x. How should we think about share purchases, dividends, further CapEx and ultimately, M&A, which is also something that kind of popped up during the quarter. So just to understand the priorities here. \nJohn Tyson: Yes. Sure thing, and thanks for the question. Let me just talk about the priorities and then talk about where we are in the year and what the outlook is. So first and foremost, we're always looking to invest in our business. And I think it's important to recognize that the CapEx deployment wave that we're in right now is typically higher than our historical average. Over the long run, something more like $1.5 billion is what we would target on an annual CapEx number. So I think that as we go into the coming years, we'll trend in that direction.  And then we look at strategic M&A where we can. We've been pretty, I think, thoughtful in that approach. We're really pleased about the Williams deal and see that as a valuable part of investing in our business. And then on the returning cash to shareholders, we remain committed to the dividend and share repurchases, I think, we'll continue to be conservative and look at something that's in line with historical norms. Obviously, there are a lot of different variables that go into that on a quarterly or annual basis as we make those choices.  But yes, I think just where we are with the profitability outlook in the business, kind of the CapEx cycle and the borrowing, we're conscious of and aware that our leverage ratio will tick up. But again, we're kind of making choices and decisions around investments for the long term of this business. So we're comfortable, although we don't like the tick up. We're comfortable with these cycles where leverage ratios may be a little bit elevated compared to our longer-term target. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. \nMichael Lavery : I just wanted to come back to the idea of growth versus profitability and just how to think about balancing that, not just for one segment, but broadly, and I guess just with so many of the headwinds you're pointing to broad in the macro environment and without really much change ahead in terms of -- it sounded like it's going to get better very soon, does that impact how you think about maybe different priorities to improve profitability? Or just to make sure the margins come through better as much as you have some things you can control? Or what's the right way to think about some of that in terms of just -- any investment trade-offs or ways to maybe improve the execution a little bit? \nDonnie King: Yes. Thanks for that question. And first thing I would tell you is that just to acknowledge the macro environment and what it's been and the fact that the magnitude and the duration of the challenges, they do continue. However, if you think about this company, in particular, we've had a 90-year history of successfully managing macroeconomic cycles, and we've always come out stronger. We have never been able to control those cycles and what we can do is control what we can control. And there's a lot of opportunity there for us to be better. And we are obviously focused on that and across all businesses and functions. In terms of growth at any cost, that's not what we're talking about here. The growth that we have is in service to our customers and those consumers. And I think as Wes had mentioned this earlier, that we always start with the demand plan, and we work back to a supply plan and so we wouldn't be growing Chicken, Beef or Pork or Prepared Foods for that matter, if we didn't have a demand plan that says that we have a consumer wanting this.  And then the second part of that is we obviously had no intention of just growing for growth's sake, and -- but we always balance growth with profitability, and I wouldn't expect this time to be any different than that. But we see this as -- this cycle as something we've seen before, and we've always accelerated out of these types of cycles, and we -- in a growth pattern, accelerating out of the curve, if you will and that's what we're doing this time as well. \nJohn Tyson: And I think if I can add on to what Donnie is saying, just to emphasize growth and the focus on high-quality growth. We've just completed a fifth consecutive quarter of record sales growth. The same is true for the Chicken segment and the Prepared Foods segment. And we're growing in the parts of those businesses that we see as attractive from a margin standpoint.  And of course, in poultry, as we've talked about, part of that has to do a little bit with just you getting the capacity utilization footprint back, right? And then it's also worth pointing out that we got a business outside of the U.S. that is trending towards tripling in about 5 years. And so I think as we think about the long term, that becomes a profit engine for us, and we're excited about the investments we've made there as well. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks. \nDonnie King: Thank you. And as you've heard today, this is a challenging moment, but my optimism about the future has not changed. Our customers and consumers are behind us. We're winning with both. This is not an accident, but is a result of the hard work our team members do every day. And I thank them for it. As we continue to build a world-class organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us, we remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. Thanks for your interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking soon. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Tyson",
            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. First, for a quick touch on our total company financial performance and then a review of the individual segments. Total company revenue was up slightly compared to last year's previous record Q2 performance as the benefit from significant volume growth in Chicken were offset by the reduction in price per pound in Beef and in Pork. For the total company and individually in Chicken and Prepared Foods, we continue to deliver record high sales performance now for a fifth consecutive quarter. We remain focused on driving growth in these businesses to enhance our margin profile over time.  Now turning to profitability. More than 90% of the decline in adjusted operating income was driven by lower earnings in Beef and Chicken. Higher input costs per pound in all segments except Pork increased our cost of goods sold. The majority was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and labor costs. The remainder of the increase was due to a few things: inventory value adjustments, unfavorable derivative impacts and a shift producing more value-added mix and this was partially offset by savings from our productivity program, reduced outside meat purchases in Chicken and decreased supply chain costs. Our pricing decreased led by lower cutout values in Beef and Pork. This was partially offset by volume growth in Chicken.  Now let me go to the individual segment results, starting with Beef. Sales in our Beef segment decreased 8.3% compared to a record high sales in the second quarter of last year. Price was down 5.4% due to reduced domestic demand and softer export markets. and volume was down 2.9% due to fewer head processed. Live cattle costs increased approximately $305 million on a like-for-like volume in the quarter as the reduction in the beef cattle herd continues to tighten supply and increase competition for cattle. The margin compression resulting from reduced sales and increased cattle costs led to a segment operating income of $8 million and an operating margin of 0.2%, down from the historically high second quarter margin of 12.7% last year.  Looking next at the Pork segment. The volume gain of 1.1%, driven by improved hog availability was more than offset by the 10.3% decline in average sales price due to the soft global demand environment, leading to a decrease in overall sales of 9.2% versus the second quarter last year. The Pork segment posted an operating loss of $31 million for the quarter which was driven by the industry headwinds compressing pork packing margins and inflationary pressures on operating costs. Moving on to the Chicken segment results. The sales increase in Chicken of 8.4% over the prior year quarter was driven by a 6.4% uptick in volume due to increased internal production. Benefits of prior period pricing actions drove 2% growth in sales despite a challenging commodity market. At a loss of $166 million, second quarter operating income was impacted adversely by market conditions and near-term impacts of strategic decisions we made that Donnie discussed earlier. Other headwinds experienced in the quarter included continuing export impacts from HPAI as well as higher feed ingredient cost of $145 million and an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $135 million, including a $35 million loss in this current quarter and $100 million gain in Q2 of last year.  The industry operational headwinds do not change our approach, though. We expect to perform as the industry best-in-class operator while growing our internal production with our customer demand, enabling us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume and gain market share. In addition to the continuous improvement of our operations, growing the market share of our portfolio of value-added products is imperative to maximizing our profitability and our long-term strategy.  Now lastly, to Prepared Foods, where our retail brands like Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and State Fair continue to deliver industry-leading performance, outpacing all peers in both revenue and volume growth in the quarter. Total sales revenue grew 1.2%, primarily driven by pricing gains. The slight volume decline of 0.4% was driven by softness in food service volumes as the trajectory of this channel's recovery remains uneven. This was almost all offset though by the strong performance of our retail brands, driven by their category-leading position, improved supply and our MAP investments.  Compared to the prior year period, segment operating income decreased modestly due to increased raw material costs and brand building investments. This was partially offset by productivity gains and price increases. While down slightly against the historically strong comp, we are pleased with the operating margin performance of 10.4% in this challenging macro environment. We continue to be excited for the future in Prepared Foods as the segment is critical to valuing up Beef, Pork and Chicken commodity meat products and delivering strong earnings at a time when the commodity protein segment's profitability is under pressure.  We will continue to unlock value by increasing plant utilization, implementing productivity initiatives, and we will grow through innovation of new offerings, expansion of our existing product portfolio and the recovery of our food service business. Now to our financial position and capital priorities, we're building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy.  First, let me spend a minute talking about our financial policy and long-term capital allocation and provide a bit more color around our approach to CapEx deployment. Our financial policy remains unchanged. We are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and targeting net leverage of at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA for the long term. Our capital allocation prioritizes investing in our business through CapEx as well as strategic and disciplined M&A while also returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  As owner operators, our approach to CapEx is simple and effective, we support our maintenance CapEx needs and then we focus on growth and profit optimization, investing in opportunities that generate the greatest returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We don't expect our total CapEx this year to exceed $2.3 billion, which is down from our prior guidance of at or around $2.5 billion.  Now moving on from CapEx, during Q2, we returned $167 million to shareholders through dividends and $19 million in share repurchases. We have increased our dividend for 11 consecutive years and remain committed to supporting our dividend. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of liquidity and net leverage of 2.4x.  Last week, we entered into a new term loan agreement for $1.75 billion to further enhance our liquidity. These funds will be used to pay off our existing commercial paper that's outstanding and some upcoming bond maturities and also to fund our investments in the business, including the pending acquisition of Williams Sausage, which will support our strategic focus on branded retail growth. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now let's review our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. Based on performance year-to-date and a moderating outlook for revenue growth, we are lowering our total company sales guidance to $53 billion to $54 billion or flat to 1% growth for the year. In our Beef segment, based on the deterioration in current market dynamics, we now expect margins to be between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1% for the fiscal year. Also, due to challenging market dynamics this time in our Pork segment, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between a loss of 2% and breakeven. In Chicken, we now expect full year margins to be between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%, based on our results so far in April, we anticipate Q3 margins to be roughly breakeven as we gain momentum and exit the fourth quarter at or above the high end of the full year range.  In the second quarter, Prepared Foods continued its strong performance, resulting in a first half margin above the guided range for the fiscal year. So we are maintaining that at 8% to 10%, driven by historical seasonality and continued brand support. And in our International business, we remain committed to expanding globally in the fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. Driven by continued year-over-year volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up, we are confident of our improved profitability in fiscal 2023, with stronger quarterly performance in the back half of the year compared to Q2.  As I mentioned earlier, we're reducing our expectations for CapEx to approximately $2.3 billion. And our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $340 million and 22%, respectively.  In summary, the first half was challenging and many of the headwinds experienced are likely to persist for the remainder of the fiscal year. Although the current operating environment has proven to be difficult, we view this as an opportunity to grow and improve our business operations, and we are optimistic on our long-term value driver prospects. We have great leadership and operational teams, growing demand for our products, robust portfolio diversity and the differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders.  So now, let me turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. Thanks, Sean. And Ben, I want to just pick up on a couple of specific parts of your question there. I think, first off, you're asking, are there further actions that we're contemplating and just to address that directly, we're always looking at the footprint, but everything that we're doing is focused on growing our business today. And I would note that with the 2 announcements we made earlier in the quarter, we're still growing the business. You mentioned inventory too, part of working through, kind of some of the changing market conditions does mean continuing to pull down inventory. And so that will influence the outlook. But you noted correctly from the earlier remarks on kind of moving to breakeven and improving through the back half of the year is what we expect to see in poultry. Yes. Thank you for that question. And let me talk about the outlook and get a little more clarity on that, when we talk about leverage. I'm glad you asked this question. So if you look at the return on sales guidance that we've given kind of on a segment-by-segment basis, it could take a few different shapes. So a point I want to make sure that our listeners take away today is that when we look at a total operating income number for the second half of the year, we expect that to be in aggregate similar to or maybe slightly down compared to the first half of the year. So depending on the different movements within the various core proteins, that's kind of the net of it. We want to make sure lands from an outlook perspective. And as you suggested, that does have implications for what our total leverage ratio as we move into the back half of the year. And what I can say is we're focused in the long run on that 2x number, and I think just pointing to what we've done in the last couple of years, we were diligent in paying off $3 billion worth of debt. We've invested in the business from a growth standpoint, we've got new operations coming online and retail branded chicken, bacon and a lot of growth outside the U.S., aligned with our strategy. So I think while the timing on some of the capital expenditures, for example, kind of puts a pressure on the operating cash flows. I think we're comfortable with where we are and feel good about the outlook. I think that we know there's volatility in our business. Ratings agencies keep up with that. I mean, I can't speak for them this morning, but we're in constant communication, providing them outlooks about the business. So overall, we feel good, but yes, the leverage ratio will pick up for a little while. Yes. If I can add to that, though, I think you asked specifically about how do we balance the profitability versus the growth. And what I want to point out is that we've pulled down the total sales outlook for the business, but we're still projecting to grow from a volume standpoint. So I think the Chicken call compared to a quarter ago is still up, but slightly less than what we had initially projected just because of the demand that was referenced. Yes. This is John. Let me say a couple of things on that. First off, let me just make a shot out and thanks to the Williams family who we've got this transaction with, and we're grateful to them for entrusting 60-plus years of a family business to be part of the Tyson family. As it relates to the kind of contours of the transaction, let me answer the question why now. We're always being diligent and thoughtful about the M&A opportunities that we're pursuing. And I think this was a transaction that we got across the finish line based on the characteristics of the branded portfolio and the return profile. So when we close that in the coming months, we're excited to bring that into the Tyson Prepared Foods business. Yes. Sure thing, and thanks for the question. Let me just talk about the priorities and then talk about where we are in the year and what the outlook is. So first and foremost, we're always looking to invest in our business. And I think it's important to recognize that the CapEx deployment wave that we're in right now is typically higher than our historical average. Over the long run, something more like $1.5 billion is what we would target on an annual CapEx number. So I think that as we go into the coming years, we'll trend in that direction.  And then we look at strategic M&A where we can. We've been pretty, I think, thoughtful in that approach. We're really pleased about the Williams deal and see that as a valuable part of investing in our business. And then on the returning cash to shareholders, we remain committed to the dividend and share repurchases, I think, we'll continue to be conservative and look at something that's in line with historical norms. Obviously, there are a lot of different variables that go into that on a quarterly or annual basis as we make those choices.  But yes, I think just where we are with the profitability outlook in the business, kind of the CapEx cycle and the borrowing, we're conscious of and aware that our leverage ratio will tick up. But again, we're kind of making choices and decisions around investments for the long term of this business. So we're comfortable, although we don't like the tick up. We're comfortable with these cycles where leverage ratios may be a little bit elevated compared to our longer-term target.

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Last quarter, we said that we expected Q2 to be tougher than Q1, and this quarter was definitely a tough one. As you will have seen in our release earlier this morning, results were weaker than expected and top line performance was mixed, particularly when compared to our strong performance last year. At the same time, we outperformed our large branded-food peers in volume and dollar sales and continue to gain pound and dollar share in our retail core business lines.  As I also said last quarter, I can't remember a time when our business faced the highly unusual situation that we're currently seeing, where all 3 of our core protein categories, Beef, Pork and Chicken are experiencing market challenges at the same time. This unusual confluence of issues continued in Q2 and directly impacted our results. I know that you watch the protein markets closely, and like us, know that there are many factors at play here that are macro in nature.  For example, Beef is cycling out of historically strong margins that were seen throughout most of fiscal 2021 and '22. Cutout values across protein complex are much lower than a year ago. Inflation has also remained elevated and persistent, which has dramatically impacted our cost. The current macro backdrop is clearly tough. We have a strong growth strategy and are bullish on our long-term outlook. We continue to implement our strategy, focus on the things that we can control and build upon the strong foundation we have in place.  Late last month, we announced important initiatives to simplify our structure and rightsize our team. These are a logical next step in our ongoing efforts to drive operational and functional excellence as we strive to be best-in-class in our industry. Last quarter, we talked about executional issues that we needed to improve and operational performance did get better. We set a high bar to execute with excellence and are making progress.  Despite our overall results, there were strong positive highlights in the quarter that serve as proof points that our strategy is working. As you know, our branded foods business is the key growth pillar for the future, and in Q2, the business performed well. These results were driven by the strength of our share position, especially for our core brands, including Jimmy Dean, Tyson and Hillshire Farm, which helped deliver strong margins compared to the same 13-week period last year.  We continue to grow both pound and dollar share and to outperform our large food peers in volume based on Nielsen data. It's clear we are winning with consumers. We also continue to win with our customers. We're proud to have been moved up into the top 10 for the first time ever in the most recent Kantar power rankings. In fact, Tyson finished in the top 10 in 6 of the 9 categories they measure. As we continue to focus on meeting customer needs and planning the future together with them. While strong performance continued in our branded foods business, I know that our results in Chicken are top of mind for many of you. So I want to spend a few minutes walking through our Chicken business in detail. I want to point you to 3 important things on the macro environment.  First, marketing conditions remain very challenging. Commodity prices for most fresh chicken cuts are much lower than last year, with boneless breast meat, tenders and wings down more than 50%. While we're not fully exposed to commodity markets, we are not immune to their dynamics. Some might expect these dynamics to impact our results immediately. But in fact, they work through on a lag. As chicken commodity prices declined in Q1, the impact continued into our Q2, while price increases we saw during the quarter are expected to affect Q3. Second, input costs were higher compared to last year as our feed, ingredient cost increased $145 million. We also realized an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $135 million due to volatility in commodity grain prices. Third, while high-path avian influenza has not had a significant impact on our live operations, key export markets remain closed. While we can't control markets, we are focused on the things we can control. We made a series of strategic decisions to better position us for the future. For example, we converted 2 of our plants from bone-in to boneless, specifically to add new business and to continue growing with an important customer. We further rationalized assets, SKUs and inventory. In fact, we reduced our finished inventory pounds by nearly 20% during the quarter. We also made the difficult choice earlier this quarter to close 2 of our less productive chicken plants. These strategic actions are expected to generate significant efficiencies going forward, although some of them generate incremental cost in our current results.  Despite challenging market conditions, we continue to execute our strategy and have significant opportunities in front of us. We increased our internal production, gaining 130 basis points of harvest share compared to last year. This led to pound share gains of 250 basis points in value-added retail and 60 basis points in food service. As you can see, we are well positioned to keep growing. We continue to invest in automation and digital capabilities with opportunities to improve our yield. We now have 50 debone lines that are fully automated. We have room to optimize our cost structure and a portion of the actions we took last month are focused on this.  Importantly, we are working more closely than ever with our customers to create value jointly. We're building long-term supply partnerships that have clear benefits for both sides. We improved order fill rates by more than 20%. This was no accident, and I'm proud of our team for accomplishing this. We're winning in the marketplace by winning with our customers.  Now I've given you specific details on the business, I want to step back and remind you of our overall strategy. Our approach to building and growing Chicken is based on 3 key elements: first, we strive to be the best-in-class operator by executing with excellence. This includes filling our plants to continue increasing our capacity utilization. Second, we plan to grow our value-added business focusing on fully cooked in retail and food service channels and by innovating and differentiating our offerings. And third, we expect to win with consumers behind the #1 brand in Chicken and win with our customers by being their go-to supplier.  I want to underscore that we are focused on improving our results in Chicken. We can do that by implementing our strategy leading to continued growth and improved margins and I'm confident that we have the right leadership team in place to get us there.  Now turning to the continued strong performance of our retail branded business. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines continue to outpace total food and beverage and our peers in both sales dollars and volume growth, up 13% and 7%, respectively, compared to a year ago per Nielsen.  Our brands continue to perform well as Tyson core business lines grew pound share by 2.4 points relative to prior year quarter. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete, delivering both dollar and pound share growth in the aggregate by more than 2 points and also across all dayparts.  As proven by our growth compared to last year, we know that consumers will spend on categories and brands they know and trust. The trajectory of our Tyson core business lines volume share growth shows the momentum we have gained with consumers. We remain focused on maintaining our improved fill rates and on-shelf availability while investing in merchandising and advertising to support our brands, which, along with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in pound share growth increasing sequentially over the past 4 quarters.  Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, all hold favorite brand status with consumers by a large margin over our nearest competitor. It is evident that we're delivering the brands and products that consumers desire. As I mentioned earlier, our move into the Kantar top 10 demonstrates that we continue to gain the confidence of our customers. Winning with customers and consumers is a key priority, and it's clear we're having success with both.  Now let me tell you why I'm so optimistic about our future. Tyson is an iconic company with a broad portfolio of products and powerful brands that has been a recognized leader in protein for nearly 90 years. We've been through market cycles before. I've been through them before myself and we've always come out stronger on the other side. We have the right strategy, seasoned leadership and team members in place to do it once again. Our vision is to deliver sustainable top line growth and margin improvement. Our strategy to drive growth is built on the foundation of 3 key pillars: first, we will drive growth in our core protein platform where we harvest and process fresh meat across a diverse portfolio. We expect global demand for protein to continue to grow in the years ahead, driven by population growth and per capita income expansion. Tyson is well positioned with the capacity in place to meet demand.  Second, we will drive growth through our branded food portfolio. We have over 30 prepared food and snacking brands, including some of the strongest brands in all of food, namely Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. Branded food is our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margins and stronger results.  Third, we will expand internationally where it makes sense. Most of the growth in protein consumption is expected to take place outside the U.S. We can capture this significant opportunity by scaling our existing business, expanding our customer base and exploring new markets. These pillars are enabled by our relentless focus on customers and consumers, operational excellence and digital capabilities to drive margin improvement.  We win with customers and consumers by building growth partnerships, delivering top-tier customer service and fill rates and product innovation. We expect to realize our operational excellence goals as we modernize our operations, driving efficiencies, saving on costs and increasing throughput. And we continue to build our digital capabilities, operating at scale with digitally enabled standard operating procedures and utilizing data, automation and AI tech for decision-making.  With the combination of our growth strategies and focus on margin improvement, we can deliver the food that consumers love and create long-term value for our customers, for our team members and for our shareholders. We've put a strong proven leadership team in place here at Tyson. I've never been more confident in the talent that we have, and I know that we have the right people to capture the opportunities in front of us.  Now I'll turn things over to John to discuss our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Okay. Ben, this is Donnie. I'll start off and then for the Chicken portion of this, I'll flip it over to Wes and let him add some detail to this. But I would say this quarter was not a surprise to us. We knew Q2 was going to be challenging and it was. I've talked about the fact that I've never seen this highly unusual situation where Beef, Pork and Chicken were all experiencing challenges at the same time. Many of these are macro in nature. But in Chicken specifically -- in Chicken, we have seen operational improvements and market recovery. While slower than expected, it will recover and of all of our businesses that are challenged right now, Chicken will recover first.  In the quarter, we had -- of our $166 million loss, $90 million of that came from 3 main areas. There was about 1/3 of it in mark-to-market, inventory adjustment, SKU rationalization accounted for about 1/3 of it and start-up costs associated with the mix change and improvement from bone-in to boneless plus a few asset impairments. So I would then go on to say Chicken remains a top priority for me. We have the #1 brand in Chicken. Our model doesn't give us the highs and lows of the commodity markets. That doesn't mean that we're not impacted by that and variable pricing model that we have in place, there are lags that go with that.  About 2 years ago, I laid out for you the plan that we had with our Chicken business, and we're following it. We're growing our volume and improving our mix. We sow what we harvested and we reduced inventory by 20%. And I would tell you that we are relentless on operational execution. We continue to invest in automation and digital capabilities and we will and do compete with the very best in the industry. We're winning in every area in which we play. We have market leadership in every category. Customers and consumers are key priorities for us, and it's clear we're having success with them. We've just recently announced that we moved up into the top 10 of Kantar for the first time ever on the most recent power rankings. We expect to win with consumers behind the #1 brand in Chicken and win with our customers by being their go-to supplier.  And I have confidence in the team that we have in our Chicken business. We have the right strategy and are doing the right things for growth. We continue to implement this strategy and focus on the things that we can control, and we'll build on this strong place -- a strong foundation that we have in place. Now with that, let me stop Ben, and let me flip this to Wes Morris, who leads that Chicken business and that team and let him add some additional color. Okay, Adam. Let me -- I'll start off and then I will pass it to Brady for some greater detail around that. But as expected in Beef that there was tightness in cattle [spot], we saw increased live cost and a softer export market. Probably the thing that is most interesting there, and unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to give you the answer to this, but it's around cow and heifer retention and we do have better, faster growing conditions. If you ook at Central Texas up to Nebraska, there still needs to be some more moisture. We saw cow harvest towards the end of the quarter began to decline. Some indication of the closure of the liquidation cycle. If you look at heifer feed numbers, we're not in a rebuild phase, just yet. More attention -- more retention is needed on the heifers before we're ready to signal that the rebuild has begun. So with that, Brady, you add some additional color, if you would. Well, thanks for that question. It's still -- as we've said, I mean, we are continually focused on being the absolute best from an operations perspective. We want to be the best company, the best brand, the best protein wherever we choose to play. And what we're doing very simply is executing those things through productivity, through efficiency to deliver that. Some of that requires adding volume, for example, in Chicken. Some of that requires improved yield and labor utilization. It includes -- it also -- looking at the assets that you have and trying to make sure that we modernize those and invest in those and get the right footprint not only today but going forward. We'll do all those things and continue doing all those things. But the whole efficiency-productivity piece is top of mind for everyone in this organization today. Thank you, Alexia. Well, first, I would tell you it was on purpose. We talked about very simply -- and the mantra around here is winning with our team members, creating a differentiated place to work, getting happy team members, having fully staffed operations was important and then winning with customers and consumers. We've invested a lot and continue to support customers and consumers with our brands, with innovation, with all those things. We want to be the best or be their go-to supplier in every part of our business. And then finally, and this is kind of where the rubber meets the road, but winning with executional excellence throughout this organization. And it is -- that is the result -- what you're seeing in this survey is a result of the work that this team has done. So Ken, I'll start off and then I will flip that to give a little more color from Wes around Chicken and Brady on Beef. But I did talk about the macro a lot. And I got to tell you, it pains me to talk about that because that we've never been able to control macro-economic issues or market conditions. But what I can tell you is we are controlling what we can. And we have a full-court press on being the best that we can be in operational excellence and winning with customers and consumers.  But the other thing I would tell you, Ken, is that here at Tyson and as you know, I've been through a number of these cycles before, this company has been -- in its 90-year history, has been through a number of them before. But what we have done in the past, and we're doing this time is we're accelerating in the bottom of this cycle, and we always come out better and stronger. And I see no reason to believe that we won't do that this time as well. And let me flip it to Wes to add some Chicken color. Thanks for that question. I'll touch on this at a high level. But in terms of your question, for the past few years, we've taken bold and aggressive steps to advance productivity and efficiency. We're constantly evaluating how we can be more efficient, push down decision-making and remove duplication of [flows]. Those are all top of mind today. But we have also have done a number of things looking at our footprint, looking for what it would take to make our less efficient assets -- and this would be across the portfolio. How do we either make them efficient, how do we automate them, how do we redesign them or, in some cases, you could look at how would you sell it or how would you close it? And we look at all those different options.  But I want to remind you that our strategy is all about growth. Growth in our base or core protein businesses, growth in our branded portfolio and growth internationally where it makes sense. So making sure that you understand clearly that we are in a growth mode and at the same time, trying to rightsize our footprint in our production machines to deliver those products that customers and consumers love. Okay. I will start off and then I'll flip it for Wes for even greater level of detail. But I would remind you that a couple of years ago, I outlined a road map for us to, what I would call, restore our Chicken business to its rightful position. Those are my exact -- almost my exact words. And we're still on that road map. We've had bumps along the way, in live production, in the life cycle of the animals that we had some issues with some of the breeding stock, particularly the males are not -- has been well chronicled, everywhere.  We had issues with hatch and we're very competitive as it relates to that today. We've made lots of improvement. We've -- we were buying, if you recall, a significant amount of product on the outside and paying a premium in the height of the market. And we began to reduce our dependence on outside meat and wanted to utilize the assets that we have in place and get the fixed cost leverage by producing those live animals and then converting those into those products that our customers and consumers love. And we've done all those things, and we're still on this journey.  And I would tell you that we got the right people in place to complete that mission, not that you ever implied, but to continue down the road, a great leadership, a great team in place now to do that. And I'm excited. I'm optimistic about the future of our Chicken business and where it's going and even in this quarter, losing $166 million. I'm still excited about the future of the #1 brand in Chicken and the opportunity that we still have before us. Wes? Yes. Thanks for that question. And first thing I would tell you is that just to acknowledge the macro environment and what it's been and the fact that the magnitude and the duration of the challenges, they do continue. However, if you think about this company, in particular, we've had a 90-year history of successfully managing macroeconomic cycles, and we've always come out stronger. We have never been able to control those cycles and what we can do is control what we can control. And there's a lot of opportunity there for us to be better. And we are obviously focused on that and across all businesses and functions. In terms of growth at any cost, that's not what we're talking about here. The growth that we have is in service to our customers and those consumers. And I think as Wes had mentioned this earlier, that we always start with the demand plan, and we work back to a supply plan and so we wouldn't be growing Chicken, Beef or Pork or Prepared Foods for that matter, if we didn't have a demand plan that says that we have a consumer wanting this.  And then the second part of that is we obviously had no intention of just growing for growth's sake, and -- but we always balance growth with profitability, and I wouldn't expect this time to be any different than that. But we see this as -- this cycle as something we've seen before, and we've always accelerated out of these types of cycles, and we -- in a growth pattern, accelerating out of the curve, if you will and that's what we're doing this time as well. Thank you. And as you've heard today, this is a challenging moment, but my optimism about the future has not changed. Our customers and consumers are behind us. We're winning with both. This is not an accident, but is a result of the hard work our team members do every day. And I thank them for it. As we continue to build a world-class organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us, we remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. Thanks for your interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking soon."

            "name": "Brady Stewart",
            "content": "Thanks, Donnie, and thanks, Adam, for the question. I think there's a few specific call outs relative to standard industry gross margin calculations that we need to take into account during this specific time frame here in '23. And number one is while we still see export demand being relatively strong from a quarter-over-quarter perspective and versus prior periods, the opportunity for us to arbitrage our exports opportunities versus domestic with some cutout runs that have occurred in specific products has actually diminished our opportunity to capture some of those results from a Tyson perspective.  Number two is we've seen some pullback on drought credit values and again, versus the previous cattle cycle, we saw drought values are strong. However, from a quarter-over-quarter perspective, again, we saw some pullback as well that certainly impacts some of the calculations relative to gross margin.  And number three, from a brand versus choice perspective, we've seen a pullback in USDA data indicates that the spread between branded and choice actually decreased $4.3 hundredweight quarter-over-quarter from a sequential standpoint. So those are certainly some of the factors that are in our mind as we continue to look at the remainder of '23.  As we move into 2024 and beyond, in addition to the comments that Donnie made relative to the cycle that we're in, there's reasons for both challenges from an industry perspective relative to gross margin. There's also a reason for us to be optimistic. And number one, we'll absolutely be relentless in terms of operational excellence. And really, it's about Tyson and our team, controlling what we can control. The markets will do their job over time, but we have a world-class Beef business, and the expectation is we'll continue to perform at a very high level as we move through the cycle.  Number two is we have the opportunity to get closer to our customers and our consumers. We have capacity within our case-ready and value-added business, we've been working diligently to fill that capacity and feel very good and comfortable in terms of the future of that business to get closer to the consumer as well. So while there are challenges ahead relative to the markets, I feel we're in a very good position to weather those challenges as we move forward. Well, thanks for the question, Peter. First of all, let me address both the question that Ken posed and you posed as well around Beef. And I think there's a few important aspects of Q2 that we need to focus on. So first is relative to timing. Tyson has quarterly pricing that we use for several of our large customers. And so in very specific primal areas where we've seen some inflation from a cutout perspective in those primals quarter-over-quarter, we have a timing lag relative to those specific customers and agreements.  Second is we did see some hedging losses in the quarter that impacted performance. Third would be our volume. And so as you mentioned, we did see a decrease relative to volume. And so when we saw that volume -- we lost some volume leverage relative to our cost structure and our assets. We're working diligently from an efficiency perspective and seen some good improvements in that area as well to help offset that as we move forward. As I mentioned earlier, export demand has been softened. The strength of the U.S. dollar and FX has had an impact on some export demand and specifically the substitution products that we see from a domestic portfolio, we're not seeing those large gains as we did in previous quarters. That relative to drop value all go into play in terms of what our actual results are versus some of the index modeling that occurs as well.  And relative to the cow-calf operator and how they look at the business, obviously, a lot has changed since the last cycle. Interest rates are up right now. There is some incentives for the cow-calf operator to go ahead and market the heifer into feed yards as opposed to retain just relative to the strength we're seeing from feeder market as well. So we're still seeing some drought conditions from Central Texas up through Central Nebraska, that's creating some challenges, but the good news is for the cow-calf operators that are working outside of that space, we've seen some remedy relative to drought conditions and moisture here within the last several months that provides some optimism as well."

            "content": "Got it. Let me pick up on that. We're pleased with the overall performance in the first half of the year. And I can see that we're making progress with both of our brands and our operations to improve margins. You're seeing that in the results. You're also -- by the way, you're seeing it in absolute dollars because I think if you looked at the first half this year versus last year, we're up about 10%. So all of that is good news.  If -- when you're looking forward, the shape of our year on a quarterly basis will look similar to last year in the sense that we expect a stronger first half than the second half and this is because of 2 things. First, because of normal seasonality in the business; and second, because we expect to have some higher brand investments behind our retail brands in the back half. That's important. Those brands are doing well. They have strong engagement with customers. And I want to make sure that we have continued investment to reinforce that. There is more work to do in food service. And in that space, the customer decision and contract cycles are longer. So it takes a little bit to win back that business. But we have a strong platform. We have good products, and I'm confident we're going to start to see the benefits of that improvement in the future. Yes. Ken, let me just add a little bit here, this is Stewart. Look, this is a company with some great brands and some really great facilities and 2 things are going to come out of this. First, there are capabilities we're going to have because right now, most of our stock harvest goes through a single facility, this is going to provide some redundancy that makes sense for our business, particularly because Jimmy Dean is so important to the portfolio. And then second, when you look at the brands that are going to be complementary to our brands, along with a [DSG] network that, frankly, we haven't had in our portfolio before, I think we're setting up for a very interesting deal here that is going to be a good addition to Tyson."

Now, I will turn the call over to Donnie.\nDonnie King: Thank you, Sean and thank you to everyone on the call for joining. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter 2023 results. We delivered solid top line results with year-over-year revenue and volume growth and continued strength in our share position, providing momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year. Compared to record performance in the prior year, first quarter earnings declined driven by weaker results in chicken, pork and beef, which more than offset strong performance in Prepared Foods. It\u2019s important for you to know that we are uniquely positioned to win in an attractive global protein market. We have market leading brands across diverse portfolio that resonate with consumers as proven by our year-over-year sales and volume growth. We serve an estimated one-fifth of U. S. protein consumption and we are well positioned to meet consumer demand, which remains steady despite a challenging macroeconomic environment with ongoing elevated levels of inflation. As we navigate a complex and dynamic operating environment, I am grateful for our team members whose hard work and dedication make our business operations possible. Five key pillars of our strategy are: transforming our team member experience, growing with our customers to service demand, investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence, restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. In service of these long-term strategic imperatives, I\u2019d like to emphasize that we continue to deliver on our commitments of growing volume by filling up our footprint, solving labor problems, investing in automation, and building inventory to meet customer demand with improved fill rates all while maintaining a focus on liquidity and financial health. We are confident these investments will pay dividends over the long run and we remain committed to methodically executing our growth strategy driving long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our results and shed some light on some of the challenges and outlook. We went into Q1 with a good plan, but our overall results were impacted by a confluence of factors, including consumer and customer demand dynamics and the curve of the beef cycle, among other things. Allow me to touch on each segment. As we have previously mentioned to you, we have been expecting beef to come under pressure for some time. With higher cattle prices, we expected overall harvest to slow down, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet. As such, we continue to draw on the herd, which continues to decline. This is putting pressure on spread margin in the business. We tightened our outlook range for the year. For pork, when you account for mark-to-market derivatives in the number, we flip back to breakeven as expected, but given continued supply and demand dynamics, we lowered our outlook for the year by 200 basis points. For chicken, when compared to expectations from last quarter, a few different things didn\u2019t go as planned. Most notably, demand didn\u2019t appear in the parts of the market where we had expected. As a result, we had to move things around and we experienced higher cost, a lower price environment and knock-on effects from a network standpoint. And last, it\u2019s worth emphasizing our Prepared Foods segment, which delivered a great result for the quarter. We said we were going to grow dollar share and volume share with the strongest portfolio of brands in the categories where we compete and we have done just that. We are feeling good about the outlook for the balance of the year. And our international business continues to build momentum in terms of volume and sales growth. With the end of COVID lockdowns, particularly in China, we expect good year-over-year comps. We will dive deeper into this during the discussion of segment results and the Q&A portion of the call. Now, let\u2019s turn to our growth numbers. Sales improved 2.5% year-over-year. And as we delivered record first quarter revenue for a total company and individually in chicken, Prepared Foods and International Other, we are focused on driving growth in these segments, which will enhance our margin profile over time. We continue to see benefits of our efforts to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. Prepared Foods revenues increased 8.8% for the quarter driven by both volume growth and pricing actions implemented in the prior year. Positive momentum continues to build in Prepared Foods, as it delivered sequential quarterly improvement in revenue since the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. Beef revenue was down 5.6% compared to prior year. Lower average sales price driven by the decreased value of beef cut out more than offset the increased volume from higher headcount throughput. Compared to prior year, pork revenue was down 6% for the quarter. This was driven by decreased volume due to balancing supply with customer demand, partly offset by increase in average sales price. Chicken revenue increased 9.6% compared to prior year driven by volume growth from increased domestic production and pricing initiatives and an elevated inflationary cost environment. In international, revenue growth remained strong, up 11.3% compared to prior year quarter. This was driven by our investment in capacity, innovation and brand to support market share growth. In the next few slides, we will detail our success winning in retail marketplace with our advantaged brands in advantaged categories. The retail categories in which we participate are highly consumer relevant with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre-pandemic and demonstrating growth over the prior year. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and BallPark, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in volume growth, up 9% relative to a year ago per Nielsen. Tyson core business lines also grew pound share by 2 points this quarter relative to year ago for Nielsen, continued to be market share leader in most of the retail core categories in which we compete. We delivered both dollar and pound share growth in both the aggregate and across day parts compared to a year ago, most notably in the morning meal occasion. Our brands continue to perform well as we see elasticities below historical levels. Additionally, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and BallPark, all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete, highlighting our brand strength relative to our peers. Consumers spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. The trajectory of our Tyson Core business lines volume share growth shows, the recovery we have seen since April and the momentum we now have. We have improved fill rates and on-shelf availability. Price gaps relative to competitors have narrowed while we continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands. These factors, along with other strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in Tyson core business lines commanding a 5-year record high market share of nearly 28%. It is evident we are delivering the brands and products that consumers desire. While the foodservice industry is yet to recover to pre-pandemic traffic levels, the Tyson Focus 6 group is outperforming pre-pandemic volume sales, up 2.7 and 1.7 share points in the latest 52 weeks according to NPD SupplyTrack data. The Tyson Focus 6 group is also outpacing both total broadline and its respective categories, up 11.7% in volume sales and 0.6 share points in the latest 52 weeks compared to last year per NPD. We believe strongly in our foodservice portfolio and are confident in the path to continue to grow this business as we align with key growing customers to build momentum for the future. Our team members are essential to providing the products our customers and consumers\u2019 demand. We are seeing business results from making significant investments to become the most sought after place to work by investing in our team members\u2019 experience. Recent highlights include expanding access to benefits with Day 1 eligibility, enhanced parental leave policies, expanding mental health benefits and citizenship support at no cost to our U.S. team members. In November, as recognition for our Tyson immigration program\u2019s commitment to improving the lives of immigrant team members, we received the prestigious Keepers of the American Dream award from the National Immigration Forum. We also just completed what we have been calling Project Next Frontier. We are setting the foundation for an HR shared service model focused on process and system efficacy and better overall HR service delivery for our team members, setting us up for savings in the future. I am pleased to report we are also progressing as expected with our North American headquarters consolidation focused on building our OneTyson culture. In addition to realizing savings, we are collaborating, innovating and working with greater speed and agility to serve our customers. I would also like to thank our team members for their dedication that led to Tyson Foods number one ranking on Fortune Magazine\u2019s list of the world\u2019s most admired companies in food production category for the seventh consecutive year. Following the strong outperformance of expectation in fiscal 2022, the productivity program is on track to meet expectations this fiscal year and to deliver the $1 billion of recurring savings commitment a year earlier than originally promised. We expect this program to translate from a onetime initiative to sustained year-on-year productivity improvements, supporting our bottom line on a continued basis. Examples of initiatives in our productivity program include leveraging data analytics to improve inventory visibility, mitigating distressed pounds, a direct plant shipment program, which continues to bring on new customers and categories, removing miles from the roads and driving efficiency in our distribution network. This is an example of how our scale drives competitive advantage. Investing heavily in automation, we recently rolled out automated sandwich hand wrap and burrito assembly capabilities as well as an automated line to serve snacking production. We have also continued to scale our chicken debone automation across multiple facilities and we are piloting a robotic tray pack machine that is showing promising results, expanding our smart factory program to digitize our plants to new sites as well as exploring opportunities to digitize our processes. Our progress displays how Tyson remains focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing the supply chain increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations. Before I turn the call over to John to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the quarter some final comments. Our segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling roles within Tyson\u2019s portfolio strategy to deliver sustainable, high-quality growth at good value. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins and channels around the world. We have products for consumers across proteins and price points, delivering performance that supports the company\u2019s long-term earnings objectives and desirable return for shareholders. We are modernizing our operations with our productivity program and are building a team positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. Again, we entered Q1 with a good plan to execute our strategy. That led to solid top line growth and strong performance in Prepared Foods. Market dynamics and some operational inefficiencies impacted our profitability. We see opportunities to become more agile and efficient, which will further improve our operational execution. We remain committed to executing our growth strategy and are confident we will grow volume, revenue and operating income in the back half of fiscal year 2023 and have a long runway of growth ahead of us. With that, I will turn the call over to John.\nJohn Tyson: Thanks, Donnie. First, let\u2019s review a summary of our total company financial performance then we can dive deeper into the detail for the individual segments. As Donnie stated, sales were up year-over-year for the first quarter, benefiting from both volume growth and disciplined revenue management to offset elevated inflationary increases in our cost of goods. Looking at our sales results by channel, retail drove $324 million of top line improvement led by Chicken and Prepared Foods. Our industrial and other channel sales increased by $108 million, led by beef and chicken and this was offset by slight decreases in sales to the foodservice and international channels. As expected, given the record strength of beef a year ago, we delivered lower adjusted operating income in the prior year of $453 million. This translated to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.85. Now, turning to the adjusted operating income bridge, we significantly grew Prepared Foods earnings in the quarter, but underperformance in chicken, pork and beef led to $979 million lower operating income compared to the prior year. While pricing actions led to an improvement of $222 million, higher input costs per pound increased cost of goods sold by $1.3 billion. About two-thirds of this increase was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and supply chain costs. The remainder was primarily due to a shift to producing more value-added mix, higher labor costs and unfavorable derivative impact. Excluding the impact of restructuring, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was down to 3.7% from 4.3% in the prior fiscal year as we continue to eliminate non-value-added spend across our business while investing to support the future growth of our brands. Our productivity program continues to play a critical role in the long-term improvement of our margin profile. Now to the individual segment results. Starting with the Beef segment, sales in the quarter remained strong at more than $4.7 billion, but were down 5.6% compared to record high sales in the prior year. Volume gains of 2.9% were supported by improved staffing for higher throughput, while the average sales price was down 8.5% due to softer domestic demand for Beef. Live cattle costs increased approximately $530 million in the quarter as cattle supplies continue to tighten. Net-net, segment operating income for beef was $129 million for an operating margin of 2.7% off the previous year\u2019s historical record first quarter margin of 19%. We saw higher cattle prices as beef herd numbers continue to decline. We will continue to monitor the beef cutout value and balance our supply with customer demand during a period of margin compression while pushing volume growth in case-ready and premium branded products. Although the near-term operating environment remains challenging, we have reasons to believe in our long-term outlook for beef. This outlook is supported by our investment in strategic supplier relationships that provide higher quality beef, a growing global demand, specifically in Asia, and the strengthening drop credit as well as opportunities to shift our beef products up the value pyramid. Now, let\u2019s look at the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.5 billion for the quarter, down 6% for the record high in the prior year. Average sales price gains of 1.4%, mostly driven by higher value specialty products were offset by volume decreases of 7.4%. International demand for U.S. pork products continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, while domestic demand is being affected by high retail prices despite the cutout realigning to historical norms. However, we are optimistic that when these factors normalize, demand will improve. We expect to see continued industry supply challenges in the fiscal year as the producer navigates herd health issues and higher input costs. On expenses, we incurred greater cost as lean hog costs increased approximately $55 million over the prior year. We also experienced an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of $35 million. Segment operating income was lower than expected at a loss of $19 million for the quarter, down from a profit of $160 million in the prior year. As we move forward, pork margins should be supported over time with the normalization and the strength of the U.S. dollar aiding future export demand, a strengthening drop credit and additional opportunity to shift pork products up the value pyramid, especially into our case-ready business. Now, let\u2019s move on to the Chicken segment\u2019s results. Sales were a record first quarter high at $4.3 billion, up 9.6% from the prior year. The sales increase was attributable to a 2.5% uptick in volume and 7.1% gain in pricing compared to the prior year quarter. Volume gains are due to a combination of strategic choices to maximize our capacity utilization and pursue an optimal mix strategy with products and customers. Our pricing results while improved were lower than expected. We pegged this to a combination of factors that influence chicken prices, mostly related to total protein availability, notably chicken and beef. We anticipate these factors easing in the back half of 2023 as beef availability lessened and total poultry harvest normalizes, providing support for improvement in our chicken prices. The fall in commodity chicken prices driven by heightened protein supply in the market and seasonal demand weakness does not change our strategy. Based on current USDA industry placement data, we are optimistic on our forward-looking supply conditions in the intermediate term. We intend to grow our domestic production to 42 million head per week during this fiscal year, which should enable us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume and gain market share. We will continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our Chicken segment, particularly by growing our portfolio of value-added products, which remain in high demand. Operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $225 million of higher feed ingredient costs and an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $40 million. Net-net, our Chicken segment delivered operating income of $77 million in the first quarter. We see significant room for improvement in the long-term operating margin of our Chicken segment as there is still work to do to attain industry leading performance and we are optimistic it can be achieved due to the following: our diversified value-added portfolio with lower margin volatility, our brand strength with the highest consumer awareness and brand loyalty according to Nielsen data, our growth strategy, taking advantage of existing capacity, optimization of our portfolio by shifting from commodity to value-added products, and last, a further implementation of our productivity program as we ramp up more automation. Last, I want to turn to our Prepared Foods business. In this segment, we had a solid quarter with growth in both revenue and volume. This was driven by strong brands, increased support for our customers and pricing aimed at recovering the continued inflation. Revenue was approximately $2.5 billion for a record first quarter, up 8.8% compared to the prior year. Volume gains of 1.2% were driven by strength in retail, notably Jimmy Dean and improved customer fulfillment despite decreased volumes in foodservice. This quarter was our third sequential quarter of volume growth and we saw significant pricing power of our portfolio with a year-over-year increase of 7.6%. Driven by top line growth and productivity savings, we delivered segment operating income of $266 million for the quarter. The operating margin of 10.5% was up from 8% in the prior year. We are very pleased with the performance of this quarter in Prepared Foods, as this segment is critical to drive profitable growth for Tyson by valuing of Beef, Pork and Chicken commodity meat products. We continue to be optimistic for the outlook of this segment due to the following. Our diversified portfolio meets consumers across meal eating occasions and snacking occasions in all sales channels. We are outperforming our competition in retail with room to grow further market household penetration. Our comprehensive foodservice portfolio has opportunity to grow by regaining lost customers and broadening our customer base. We have got additional operational efficiencies to unlock by increasing plant utilization in addition to the implementation of our various productivity initiatives. And finally, we have an opportunity to innovate, expand and acquire into new spaces through new offerings, the growth of our existing products, and attractive disciplined approach to M&A. Now, turning to talk about our financial position. Building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. We produced operating cash flows of $762 million for the quarter and our leverage ratio finished the quarter at 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our commitment to a sound balance sheet. Focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives, we invested nearly $600 million into our business in the first quarter to capitalize on projected demand growth over the next decade. Investment in the business, both organically and inorganically, is expected to generate returns at or above our 12% return on invested capital target over time. Our capital allocation priorities are first to invest in growth and productivity in our existing footprint. Then we will employ a disciplined M&A approach by investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio. Next, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we will continue to support and grow the dividend for our shareholders as evidenced by its continuous payment since 1977 and annual increases each fiscal year since 2013. Our approach to share buybacks will continue to be managing for dilution and entering the market opportunistically when assessing for multiple factors. We returned nearly $500 million in cash to shareholders in the quarter through $169 million in dividends and $313 million of share repurchases. At Tyson, we utilize a disciplined capital allocation approach to invest in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and we returned cash to shareholders while maintaining a robust balance sheet. Now, let\u2019s turn to the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. We are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $55 million to $57 billion, which implies a 3% to 7% sales growth for the year. Supported by the factors detailed earlier, we expect future Beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% in the long-term. However, based on current market dynamics, we now expect to perform between 2% and 4% this fiscal year. Given the result in pork in the first quarter, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between 0% and 2%. Counter to normal seasonality for our pork segment, we expect the back half of the year to outperform the first half of the year. For our poultry business, we now expect full year margins to be between 2% and 4%, but gaining momentum through the year and exiting the fourth quarter at a margin above this range. Prepared Foods had a strong first quarter in performance as this is historically normal seasonality for the segment we are maintaining our expected full year margin performance to be between 8% and 10%. In international, we continue to see volume and sales growth year-over-year, and we anticipate improved profitability in fiscal 2023, driven by volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up. We remain committed to growing our business internationally, representing the fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. Our expectation for CapEx for the remainder of the year is unchanged at approximately $2.5 billion. Our expectations for productivity savings remain unchanged at $300 million to $400 million. Our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $330 million and 24%, respectively. We remain committed to our investment-grade rating and managing our net leverage ratio to be at or below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA over the long-term, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders. In summary, we had a slower start than expected, but are optimistic on the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and long-term. We have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity and a differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. Overall, we see some persistent market factors, some operational challenges, and some expected seasonality influencing our second quarter results. And therefore, we\u2019re expecting total company volume, revenue and operating income to be meaningfully stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. We remain in the strong financial position to support continued investment in our existing footprint, productivity and the support of our brands as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders. So with all that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\nSean Cornett: Thanks, John. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nJohn Tyson: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. I guess we need to focus in on the Chicken segment here. And I know in your prepared remarks, you made some comments about why things came up short this quarter. Can you talk about what was the big negative surprises, chicken prices? It sounds like there were some operational and executional issues. And also, as we look forward, can you talk about how quickly you expect some of those issues to resolve? And what gives you the confidence that they might improve over the remainder of the year? And then I have a follow-up.\nDonnie King: Okay. Alexia, thank you and thank you for your question. I\u2019ll start out with some broad comments, and we will get a little more tactical as it relates to chicken and then wait to your next question. But I would just simply tell you that Q1 was a very challenging quarter for us is the confluence of several external factors across all businesses. We saw market swings across all businesses and they were unpredictable and sizable. While we have opportunities to perform better and you would never hear me say anything other than that. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen all markets work against us all at the same time. It\u2019s the first time I remember market impacts being greater than those controllables that we have and the opportunity for improvement of them. As we think about moving forward, efficiency in our operations and our company will be a focal point for us. There are some places where we need to make decisions faster and, in some cases, better decisions. In some cases, we will need to adjust our business model. And in other cases, the accuracy of our projections has to be better than what we\u2019ve demonstrated here in Q1. I\u2019d remind you and everyone else that we\u2019re not bigger than the market. And in Q1 and over time, markets will do their job, and we simply have to do ours. Q2 will be seasonally softer than Q1, and the back half will be better than the first half. While the back half will be better than the first half, we feel good about our business outlook. For example, we knew the beef herd is nearing the bottom of the cycle. We knew pork had heard health issues and that there would be incremental packing capacity coming online and it did. We did not expect the incremental beef, pork and chicken in the marketplace domestically in Q1, especially in light of the fact that the cost of animals and the cut out of the pricing was declining. Our Prepared Foods performed as expected, delivering on operating income. We grew share in both dollars and pounds in the quarter. And I would just \u2013 I have to remind everyone else before I get into chicken in the details is that we have a strong diversified portfolio, and we have confidence in our multi-protein strategy that it will deliver growth and shareholder value. Now let me go a little deeper as it relates to chicken, and we perhaps can go even deeper or later. In chicken, we have a differentiated model. We have the number one brand in chicken. We\u2019ve talked often about the fact that our model doesn\u2019t get the highest or lows of the commodity markets. This does not mean we\u2019re not impacted. For example, we talked a lot about variable pricing models, we have those. And \u2013 but I would remind you that those pricing models have lags as well. As we started this year in chicken in particular, we had a good plan. We still like our chicken business, but there were a lot of moving parts in Q1. So what happened in Q1? Our volume was up 3% and our harvest pounds were up 15%. This is due to a mix shift from small bird bone-in to more of a boneless product, and it was part of our strategy. Our supply plan is dictated by our demand plan. This is a core tenet of our business. We plan for a strong November and December. If you\u2019ll remember, for fresh chicken, if you remember, we shorted fresh chicken in the last 3 years in a significant way, and we had a plan in place this holiday season to not have that happen again. November and December were softer than we expected or planned for in retail fresh chicken. This created excess in our retail fresh chicken. Because of sales didn\u2019t materialize in retail fresh. This triggered a resale or movement of products. The resale price was much lower than modeled for the original sale. So to help you a little bit, I would say, just to dimensionalize this, that about two-thirds of our miss was market-driven and about third of the miss was related to labor, yield and spend, some of which was associated with the movement of product because of the miss on fresh chicken, the movement of product from one location to another impacted labor, yield and created incremental freight costs. We also had some knock-on effects of building inventory as a result of this, inventory above our plan. And as a reminder, avian influenza impacted our pricing and volume on both cost and chicken leg quarters in the quarter. There was more chicken, beef and pork in the market than anticipated. So it sounds like a lot of excuses there. I get that. So what now what, so what are we doing? I\u2019d tell you that we still have a great chicken business. We still have a good plan. We are cleaning up and have been cleaning up some issues from Q1 that I\u2019ve talked about earlier. So as we think about from this day \u2013 or since Q1, we have to control the controllables. I would remind you that we are fully staffed, and we continue to invest in a better workplace experience through automation, etcetera. We are growing our business, servicing our customers and becoming the most sought-after place to work and we will compete with the very best in the chicken space. So, let me pause and get a follow-up question and we will go from there.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you for that. Just moving quickly to the Beef segment, you\u2019ve given us a range of 2% to 4% on the operating margin side now. Prior to that, it was more open ended just below your long-term guidance. What has become clearer? What is more certain now about the outlook for this year? And what gives you the confidence that it will come in within that range and not below it? Thank you and I will pass it on.\nDonnie King: Alright. Thank you. I will \u2013 I\u2019ll start out on this, and then I will flip it to Brady for a few comments. We\u2019re moving closer to the bottom or to the trough of the beef cycle. We obviously were surprised at the amount of beef harvested in our Q1. There was a lot more beef on the market than what we had expected particularly in light of increased pricing \u2013 or excuse me, increased cost of cattle and at the same time, a decline in cut out. So that was a bit of a surprise to us. That\u2019s a miss for us. But we are moving closer. We know that there are more hoppers being harvested. We know there are more cows being harvested. We know what those signs are that we are looking for in terms of when the herd would rebuild. And it\u2019s going to require a rain or precipitation. It\u2019s going to require the rancher to see more forage in hay. Availability, those are some of the things you need to look for. But as we\u2019ve gotten a quarter closer to answer your question, Alexia, we \u2013 we see a little more clearly than now. We know that the trough is coming, but we wanted to \u2013 the number you see is a conservative number for us and making every effort to make sure that we guide you to where we see Q2 and the balance of the year going. And so Brady, let me see if you want to add anything to that. Welcome, Brady Stewart.\nBrady Stewart: Thank you, Donnie. And certainly, your points relative to cattle availability and the look into the future is spot on the drought, lack of affordable hay and forage and higher overall supply chain costs are still driving cal liquidation in parts of the U.S. as we move out of this cycle of the cal liquidation and start to see some [indiscernible] replacements into the future, we will certainly have better visibility to the trough that you mentioned as well, Donnie. Why I am optimistic about the future? Is the team has worked diligently and effectively to strategically align ourselves with suppliers to ensure we have the supply required relative to higher grading cattle. We feel good about global demand, specifically on higher-grading beef products from a macro standpoint. We\u2019re seeing some appreciation in drop credit values, specifically on specialty products, including fats and oils. And while it is hard to pinpoint the exact bottom based on the current drought and feedstock conditions, we are seeing some moderation and some signs of optimism relative to the drought conditions that we will keep an eye on moving into the future.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Ken Goldman at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of questions. First, Donnie, you made a change at the top in the Chicken segment. Can you outline a little bit which changes are most important as we think about the next few years that you\u2019d like to see and maybe why the change was made now?\nDonnie King: Sure, Ken. I\u2019d be happy to \u2013 David Bray was leading our poultry business. And I talked about in Q1 that we had some issues as it related to markets and the amount of protein on the market. The change that we made is a result of some of the controllables that I think we made some good decisions. I\u2019d like to have seen those decisions faster and perhaps some better quality of decisions and there were things in Q1 as it relates to chicken that we could have done better. And I made the change. I went out immediately and recruited Wes Morris, who Wes has had has run many parts of our Chicken business. He\u2019s led our Prepared Foods business, and he\u2019s also led our Case-Ready beef and pork business. And they had an opportunity to pick up a great talent with many, many years of experience and know-how in this business, and we made the change. In terms of the overall organization, Shane Miller leaving our pork \u2013 or excuse me, our beef and pork business, our fresh meats business, the relocation got change. Shane is still actively engaged in the company. He and Brady are working through a transition. And so we \u2013 when Shane decided he could not move for reasons. By the way, Shane is still trying to figure out how he can get here and be a part of it. There are some personal things that he\u2019s got to deal with. But we were fortunate to pick up Brady Stewart, who is the COO of another company, and he\u2019s well versed in the pork business and the packaged meats business and could do a number of roles for us going forward. We\u2019re very fortunate to be able to pick up both Wes and Brady in our organization, and we look for great things from them. But we\u2019ve got a lot of upside and runway in the organization because of them. Recently, we announced Amy Tu leading our international business, along with a few other functions. But we\u2019re excited about Amy and what she\u2019s doing and her passion for the international market and her passion for growing Tyson in international markets. And I feel really good about where we are from an international perspective. I feel really good about where we are from a chicken perspective and the leadership there. I feel really good about where we are from a beef and pork perspective. If you click down one level as it relates to beef. That team is largely intact moving here, and some have, in fact, already moved here. So Stewart, you saw the numbers in Prepared Foods. Stewart has done a really nice job of challenging the business and upgrading pork raw material into this branded portfolio that we have. And then finally, today \u2013 actually today, Melanie Boulden is joining us. And so why Melanie and why a Chief Growth Officer, it was all in an effort to try to get a center of excellence here in Springdale, Arkansas around branding, marketing, communication and innovation. And Melanie has got great experience in consumer packaged goods and most recently, Chief Marketing Officer in a food and beverage company. So I\u2019ll pause and take a breath right there, Ken, and wait for a follow-up.\nKen Goldman: No, no, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. I guess as my quick follow-up, it\u2019s obviously not the largest segment you have, but since you mentioned international, it\u2019s never made money. And I\u2019m just curious. I\u2019m not trying to be critical of it because, obviously, it\u2019s \u2013 but in the long run, it\u2019s going to be a business that should be very profitable for you and others. But what\u2019s the strategy? Don, you\u2019ve taken a much stronger tack toward, I think, profitability and margins and just efficiency than perhaps your predecessors have. Between you and Amy, what is the frac that we should expect that margin to be going on ahead?\nDonnie King: Thanks, Ken. We do appreciate the interest in our International business. I would tell you that we\u2019ve invested a great deal in plants. And with COVID over the last year, particularly in the foodservice channel, we\u2019ve had some headwinds with that. Those have lessened. And we\u2019re in a sweet spot there in terms of our alignment with global customers, many of which are in the food service channel. But we also have launched a branded portfolio across Thailand, Malaysia and China. And we feel good about that. It\u2019s \u2013 they are doing \u2013 the brands are doing really, really well and provide not only innovation or outside the U.S., and we also take that innovation and we add that and we bring some of those things back to the U.S. But we feel good about it. It\u2019s been an investment. It\u2019s been a long time coming, but I think you will see here in \u201823, our international business delivered some really nice results for in the way of operating income. Amy, anything you would like to add to that?\nAmy Tu: Ken thank you for the question and pointing out profitability, our non-profitability over the last few years. I think Donnie is absolutely right. This is our growth strategy. We\u2019ve talked about in the past where global population growth will happen and will happen outside the United States. And so we\u2019re taking our existing footprint right now. We\u2019re putting in place the kind of execution fundamentals that we need to have. And then we\u2019re also discussing with our other segments, the opportunities that lie before us, given the raw materials that we have here in the United States. But Donnie just put forward exactly what we have outside the United States with our strong brands. We are launching smart factories. We are able to do things more quickly outside the United States which will give us ultimately a benefit for the entire company. So more to come, but we are very excited about what we see right now.\nJohn Tyson: Hey, Ken, Also, this is John. And I think it\u2019s just worth pointing out. The business has been profitable over the last few years. And on an EBITDA basis, we look at something in the high single digits for that. So I think there is financial performance to support the continued investment there, but at the right...\nKen Goldman: Yes, there is more to do it. Okay, perfect. Thank you, John.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nDonnie King: Hi, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey, good morning. I want to ask a follow-up on chicken. Donnie, I think you characterized the underperformance in the first quarter as two-thirds of the market, one-third Tyson-specific as you look forward, understanding that your view is, and I think we would agree that recovery is underway in kind of commodity chicken fundamentals, what is the critical path from an internal standpoint to improve that business from here? I think last year, the focus was hatchability, that was a big opportunity around growing capacity utilization what are the focus points as we move through fiscal \u201823?\nDonnie King: Thanks, Ben. I will make a few remarks, and then I\u2019ll pass it to Wes for a little more detail. As I said in my opening comments to \u2013 also in the first question, we still feel really good about our chicken business. We think we have a good plan. Yes, we got hitting the mouth in Q1 because of all the protein on the market in Q1. And our tray pack, our fresh chicken business did materialize as we had expected. And so we kind a created \u2013 we created our own issue with that because of what happened in the market. But I would tell you, we still have tremendous opportunity and upside as we execute this business. And it\u2019s nothing exciting, but it\u2019s the fundamentals of labor and yield and spend and just maintaining growing this business to fill up our capacity and service the needs that we have. And I would remind you that you and everyone else that we place chickens based on what our demand plan looks like is in service of our demand plan. So as we go back and look at what happened in Q1 and think about the future, in Q1 strategically, the only thing that went awry was the fact that the demand didn\u2019t materialize in the place at retail in which we thought it would. And so that triggered a number of other inefficient moves and activities. But again, we think Q1, you\u2019ve seen the numbers, Q2 is seasonally softer. But as we start getting towards the to that Q3 time period, we feel good about it, and we don\u2019t have something that\u2019s broken here that like a hatch issue and a genetics issue, the time horizon for fixing this is much shorter than many of those things. Wes, anything you want to add to that?\nWes Morris: Yes. Good morning, Ben, and thanks for the opportunity. First, let me say how excited I am to be a part of Tyson Foods. This is a great chicken company. It\u2019s got great people, great brands, great customers. And I want to echo what Donnie said around, we did a lot of foundational work and executed it very well. We said that we would improve our capacity utilization. We would staff our plants and they are at a record staffing level. We\u2019ve added automation and got some opportunities as we start up that that negatively impacted our yield in Q1. And then we said we\u2019d rebuild inventory post COVID to better service our customers and our order fill rate indicates that we did that well. And so from a live perspective, we performed very well. The volatility of our hatch numbers are behind us, and we did exactly what we said we were going to do on the live production side. And so that allows us to focus more of our energy on standing up that automation to its expected results. And to make sure we\u2019re still meeting the needs of the consumer. But the one thing that\u2019s obvious we can do better is understanding the consumer shifts in our business and making sure we got the right amount of birds in the right place at the right time.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay, very good. Thank you. My second question is on the Prepared Foods business, a very strong start to the year. The guidance is unchanged. I know it\u2019s early in the year, but implied in the guidance being unchanged is a moderation in the operating margin. So what is it that we would need to see for that to happen? How much of that is it\u2019s early in the year and you want to get a little bit more of the fiscal year under your belt to adjust that guidance versus explicit view that things soften from here?\nDonnie King: So let me make a comment, and then I\u2019ll flip it over to Stewart. In terms of prepared, we did deliver what we said we would in Q1. We feel good about that on a go-forward basis with these iconic billion-dollar-plus brands that we have, we feel good about that. Stewart said in the last quarter that retail was really, really good, and we had some work to do as it relates to the food service side. And of course, we\u2019re still not back to pre-COVID levels in the food service channel. And so there is some upside for that opportunities when that happens, but we need more demand there. I would tell you, even in all of that we continue to grow our share in the foodservice prepared and poultry business. But Stewart, why don\u2019t you add some color to this?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Thanks for that, Donnie. Well, look, foodservice, as I said last quarter is operating from a very, very strong platform. And investors should expect to see that over the medium-term that, that business continues to grow and the profitability improves. And in the short run, we have got a job to do on foodservice, and I believe we are making progress there as I look at the pipeline that\u2019s developing. Very strong performance on retail, but acknowledge that in the first quarter, some of that is seasonal as you look at some of the Sausage Breakfast, Sausage Products that we have. And we are taking some of that benefit. I feel good about the guidance we have given for the year. There may be a little bit of variability in some of the quarters. But I am really standing on the fact that this is a solid platform that we can continue to see go from strength-to-strength.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi guys. Thank you. Hi. Good morning. So, I guess coming back to chicken a little bit more deeply. I guess I am trying to just kind of square kind of the point on market kind of demand dynamics were a bit responsible for pretty unfavorable mix. And Donnie, you talked about your sales volumes in chicken up, I think 2.7%, but harvest up 15%. So, clearly and you talked about too much meat in the market. If I think about your own harvest levels up 15%, that would represent a pretty disproportionate amount of the increase in poultry production in the industry in the fourth quarter. And so I guess I am just trying to get a sense of when you say market was the source of weakness, is it just pricing, is it mix, or is it just \u2013 look, we saw the big bird cut up be down with commodity market pricing was bad, or is it just demand in your highest value channel or higher value channel in retail tray pack and you had to sell that meat into the big bird market at a discount at a lower value?\nDonnie King: Let me make a few comments, and then I will let Wes add some color to this. The miss for us was clearly in our fresh chicken, our tray pack chicken at retail. That was where we stumbled. The demand for our branded retail products was very good, demand for our foodservice chicken products were all very good. The thing that has exacerbated this was the amount of overall protein in the marketplace in Q1, beef, pork and chicken. While our harvest pounds were up 15%, remember that we are converting all those pounds into a boneless form, right. That\u2019s different. That\u2019s a mix shift and a strategy change as we get out of some of the more small bird, whole body, 8 Piece type products. We talked about that last quarter. We have moved into a boneless mix in that area. And we have got more to come as it relates to that. But Wes, why don\u2019t you cover some of the details?\nWes Morris: Yes. Adam, thanks for the question. Like I said before, we executed our live plan very well and did exactly what we said we were going to do. We did have a strategic mix change and had less bones. And then one of the other drivers was the impact of our sales of 2% to 2.5% of a lot of chicken depending on what size. Rebuilding our safety stock inventory. And then the seasonal increase in inventory to supply wings to the marketplace. But Adam, the way I would ask you to think about it is at a macro level, we did a very good job, and we absolutely had the right number of chickens. We simply had them in the wrong place based on the post-COVID changes. And so we had more than we needed in our fresh chicken business and came up short in some other areas.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay. And then I guess, this goes to both the performance in the quarter and the change in outlook for the balance of the year, just you guys reported in mid-November, nearly halfway through the quarter at that point. I just \u2013 help me understand kind of where the information disconnect was between live production operations and financial planning that there was this big of a disconnect in the period? And in terms of the magnitude of the guided margin change for the rest of the year, is that just continued unfavorable mix? Is that cost? Is that contracting and pricing? I am just trying to make sure I understand the moving pieces on the magnitude of that margin change relative to three months ago.\nDonnie King: Sure, Adam. So, I have said earlier that as a way of a reminder that we start with a demand plan and that over the past 3 years, we have not been able to service the demand in fresh chicken at retail. We were trying to correct that at this point. And every demand signal we had said that the demand was going to materialize and we place chickens accordingly. Remember, we placed those chickens for that November timeframe back in August. And so we were going \u2013 I understand your point about we are in November and we are having the last earnings call. A lot of things from that day forward, the demand didn\u2019t show up in fresh chicken. A lot of the other things worked exactly the way we planned for them. And \u2013 but that trigger, if you think about fresh chicken, you typically put that products in a tray and then before you have the order. And when the order doesn\u2019t show up, then you have to take it out of the tray or sell it in the tray at a discounted or in a distressed fashion. We had a lot of that in our Q1. And we have cleaned up that. We are still trying to get ourselves going back again. Q2 is going to be seasonally softer, variable pricing models and the lag associated with that. I mean we will get caught up with that. The back half of the year, we feel good about where we are going to be relative to that. And so Wes, that\u2019s I think the first question, what about the second one?\nWes Morris: Yes. Optimistic about the path forward, the USDA is projecting Q2 numbers around 2%, which is a lot less chicken availability than the 77 increase we saw in Q1. Then when you couple that with 4% to 5% less cattle, you should have an overall protein per capita that is much smaller than what we saw in Q1. We are already seeing some changes in the marketplace. Since the end of the quarter, we have seen boneless go up the quarter. Wings are up around $0.14, $0.15. And so optimistic going forward that the chicken values will correct. We have talked about variable pricing on a lot of these different calls. And the good news is it\u2019s much, much faster than the historical 1-year fixed price agreements. But unfortunately, it still has a short-term lag as these markets correct, it will take a minute to hit the self sheet.\nJohn Tyson: Hey Adam, this is John, too. I think there is just a couple of other things that we have said that are worth reemphasizing. One is, and I think you asked a good question about, hey, what was going on, you have talked to this last time in November. I think in addition to all the poultry dynamics that Donnie was described here, I think there is still different of outlook as it relates to beef availability, which I think was maybe a little bit of a surprise. And then I think as it relates to the outlook for the year, if you just look at kind of what the public data says, I think it\u2019s something like 25% to 30% more chicken meat in the freezer. And so our plan is to account for working through that, but it does take some time to work through that. And there are timing differentials between how the market recovers and where our pricing recovers. So, all of that influences just the shape of the year for us. And I think we have also said this, but just to make sure the listeners on the call get it today, Q2 will be softer for us in Q1. And we expect to see a recovery in what is our Q3 and Q4, the second part of our fiscal year.\nJohn Tyson: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks for the question. I guess the follow-up is it sounds like there is no change to your production plan for chicken. I think you had a plan of 42 million head per week. Is that still the same? And I don\u2019t know, like do you still have to harvest 15% more chicken now in order to satisfy the demand that you have three months from now? Is it \u2013 are you still at a 15% increase in production?\nDonnie King: So, let me make sure I separate it for you. Great question, by the way. One is head and one is weight. The 15% is weight. The head is different. We have talked in terms of in fiscal \u201823, by the end of fiscal \u201823, we would be at about 42 million head a week. And that\u2019s still the plan. I would also tell you that the plan is \u2013 I mean, the demand is there to support 42 million chickens a week. And if that changes, we will change. But that\u2019s what we see right now as we look at the demand picture. The other thing that I think that \u2013 and I will just say it as we talked about the beef cycle and the pork cycle and herd health and so forth, I think it\u2019s \u2013 if you look at what happened in Q1, I think every chicken company in America, read the headlines around there is going to be less beef, less pork, and the natural belief is that chicken will fill that gap. But the problem with all of that is there wasn\u2019t a gap in beef and pork in Q1. And so I think you are seeing even now based on the numbers that Wes quoted earlier, you are seeing adjustments in the marketplace relative to that. And \u2013 but we will always balance our supply with what our demand needs are. And I just \u2013 it\u2019s just the fundamental tenet of how we operate this business and have operated for many years.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. I guess the follow-up is, I have gotten questions from investors asking whether this is an indication of much weaker demand from consumers. Would you describe it that way, or is it really oversupply that\u2019s been the issue. And then in the back half of your fiscal year, you think that, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to correct? It\u2019s not really demand needs to get better. It\u2019s that the supply needs to normalize?\nDonnie King: I think you are spot on relative to that. And you are \u2013 I think you are already seeing adjustments in terms of the supply plan. I would tell you and I don\u2019t want to mislead you or anyone else on this. There is some, there is unusual erratic to describe a behavior as it relates between channel swapping and even parts of the store and how \u2013 what\u2019s going on there. Swapping between proteins, all the normal things that you would know from all your years of covering this protein sector, they are all in play. But I think this is \u2013 I think in Q1, this was a supply issue first and foremost. Secondly, there was some shifting in what part of the store and what products were purchased.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to dig a little bit into if you could explain in more detail what happened on the derivatives in both cases chicken and pork? And if there is something else outstanding that might go wrong going forward and how you are planning on trying to not run into this? Because I think you said on pork, without the derivatives, it would have been positive, but then obviously, because of there has been were negative, so just to understand a little bit of that dynamic. That would be my first question.\nJohn Tyson: Hey Ben, this is John. I think maybe just a couple of comments headlining on kind of how we are using hedging and derivatives as it relates to a risk management kind of overarching strategy. Generally speaking, what you would expect from us is to kind of have coverage in the near-term, coordinated with what our sales picture looks like with customers. And we really use it as a margin management tool more than any type of speculative tool. And so I think that just emphasizing that last point, we would not project any \u2013 there is no outside best sitting out there in terms of what the markets are going to be doing. We kind of keep things in close and use it more from a margin management standpoint.\nBen Theurer: Okay. And then just from a like general within prepared foods, I mean obviously, you had a very good quarter, both pricing still nicely up, but at the same time, volume was actually up. Can you help us understand how much of that volume was just recovery in some of the foodservice thing as you were saying, you still need to catch up here on the volume to get to pre-pandemic levels? And are you seeing any sort of elasticities or any headwinds on some consumers becoming a little more sensible to the price increases, just to understand the volume impact within it as it was still positive?\nStewart Glendinning: Yes. Sure. Well, Stewart here. I will just pick that up. So, first of all, look, like I said earlier, we have a very, very powerful platform here, both on the retail side and on the foodservice side. The increase in volume was not driven by food service. Foodservice for me is still a place where there is a lot of work to be done. A good platform, but opportunity to fill some plants to sell harder against volume that we lost during COVID. This was driven by the strength of retail. And what was really impressive in the quarter was the ability of our brands to gain price to offset some inflation and also to gain ground with consumers. But we are working closely with our customers. We are providing the right level of support for our brands. And I think this \u2013 the performance in this quarter just demonstrates the real strength of our retail platform. At the same time, there is ground that we can cover in innovation. I am pleased that Melanie is on Board. She is going to be a big help. There is ground we can cover from a productivity standpoint. Just in running our operations better. And certainly, we will start to fill up that foodservice volume.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the consumer demand piece and just understand you have said you have seen channel shifts and protein shifts and things that sound pretty typical. But in just a few weeks, the elevated SNAP party is going to be over. And just curious how you think about for that cohort, which it is a certain demographic. But \u2013 how do you think about that impact in your planning for the rest of the year?\nDonnie King: Sure. I will start and then offer it up to anyone else that may have something to add. But I think it\u2019s \u2013 if you look at the information that we see, it says the consumer is working through savings. In the middle of the pandemic, they were able to bank a lot of savings. And over the last little bit they have been working through that savings. And I think many consumers are now out of that \u2013 those savings and/or at least nearing the last of it. And so I would expect the consumer to be under more pressure as we move forward in this year. And \u2013 but I would also remind you that as a company, if you look at our brands and we cover the spectrum across proteins. We have a product for every consumer across various proteins and price points. So, we feel very good about the fact that we can intersect with that consumer wherever they are. And that\u2019s I think a good position to be in and are the best position you can be in. And so we will see how it turns out. But we don\u2019t know any more about that than you do today.\nJohn Tyson: Yes. I would add two things to what Donnie is saying. Number one, if you think about the kind of prepared and retail branded side of our business, we have been paying attention to what the consumer is doing and feeling over the last few quarters and we continue today. I think the good news is even in these times where the outlook for the economy is evolving, we have had pretty steady growth and pretty strong performance in that part of our business, which tells us that while, yes, there may be a lot of behavioral changes going on in the economy, we see consumers come into the brands and the categories that we are in repeatedly. So, I think we feel good about that. On the second point I want to make is from a \u2013 how to say it, the supply and demand balancing on the kind of fresh and frozen more commodity protein side of our business, has more influence on how we are performing than does the macro situation because people are going to continue to eat protein. They may cut back on other things, but food is not one of them.\nMichael Lavery: That\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up on the beef spreads you have called out the drivers of the pressure near-term. But any sense of how long before it can rebound? And I know you don\u2019t want to get into fiscal \u201824 really, but maybe any just directional guardrails of how to think about it? Is this going to be more of the same for a while? Is there something you can point to that\u2019s a catalyst one way or the other, just a little bit maybe longer look if there is anything you can add there?\nDonnie King: Yes. I mean it\u2019s I wish I could be here before you today and tell you I knew when that was going to happen. But there is kind of some prerequisites before we are going to see [indiscernible] retention, which is going to be driven by better precipitation, getting past the drought and for ranchers to see to have hay that\u2019s more affordable and forage land to be able to feed those animals. I don\u2019t think you are going to see [indiscernible] retention in a meaningful way until those things occur. And I have listened to every expert that\u2019s been through all of these cycles through all of these years. And I have been through a couple of them myself. It\u2019s I get a number somewhere between the spring of \u201823 and the spring of \u201824. And that\u2019s how variable it could be. What I can tell you is the harvest of [indiscernible] and the harvest of cows continue. And in a lot of cases, people are paying up for those animals to sell them at a \u2013 for a lesser cut out. So, that\u2019s what I can tell you about it, Brady, anything you would add to that?\nBrady Stewart: No, Donnie. Donnie, I think you covered it very well. We have a different situation today than we have in the past as well relative to some of the interest rate pressures. That certainly will have an impact as these ranchers decide to retain [indiscernible] as well. So, that coupled with some of the weather and impacts that we see certainly create the uncertainty that you outlined.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Larson with Seaport Research Partners.\nEric Larson: Hi. Yes. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s on the beef cycle again. And it is \u2013 I guess it\u2019s not surprising that we continue to see call it [indiscernible] slaughter. But I guess the question that I have, and it\u2019s related to this, we are at 50-year kind of low on these various cattle sectors. And it seems like the recovery for this will certainly take quite a bit longer than maybe I would have expected. Is that \u2013 and now when you have got new capacity coming on stream from some more competitors, what does the increase in capacity with lower and maybe more sustainable lower supplies mean for the mid to longer term margin for your business?\nDonnie King: Yes, I will make a few comments, and Brady can step in on this. I mean I think you have described it very well in terms of what the levers are here. Everything you have said I think I agree with what you have said and how you characterize it. And you have also described this future state where there will be more packing capacity with fewer animals. And so if you build the capacity, these are \u2013 for these large plants, you can spend $1 billion to build the beef plant. So, if you spend $1 billion to get a beef plant, you are going to process animals. And so that could all likelihood drive up the price of the cattle that are available at that point. But you are going to get some pushback with the consumer if you try to cover that or try to get cut out to cover that. So, I see all the same pressures and dynamics that you just outlined. And it\u2019s going to take a bit to rebuild the herd. And once we get to whatever the bottom is, I mean we are looking at 2-plus years to be able to see some better times. Brady?\nBrady Stewart: Thanks for that, Donnie. I think there is a couple of other factors that we need to consider as we come out of the cycle. And one of them is certainly relative to export demand. And we have seen an increase in terms of demand from our export partners relative to higher grading cattle. I think that is an anomaly relative to cycles that we have certainly seen in the past, and it\u2019s something that we will be watching as well. Now, we have seen the strength that I mentioned earlier relative to some of the drop values in byproducts as well. So, certainly combining not only the supply factors that you touched on from a live cattle perspective, but also the demand factors that are going to come into play from both our export customers and our domestic customers is certainly a focal point for us.\nEric Larson: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to management for any final remarks.\nJohn Tyson: Sure. This is John again. And just a couple of things to wrap up on. We want to make sure we got to cover with you before I hand it to Donnie to close it off. I think the first thing, if we think about the top line guidance that we have given, our outlook there is probably in the bottom half of that range just to kind of crystallize where we are today. And I think the second thing is we didn\u2019t really have to touch on capital allocation today, although I know it\u2019s a point of interest for many folks. And our capital expenditure outlook for the year is firm at or around that $2.5 billion number. But I think what we would guide to as we look forward, that\u2019s probably the high watermark. And for us, our priorities are kind of preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing for returns in our business and then after that, being disciplined on M&A, dividends and share repo. So, I just want to make sure people understood kind of what the outlook was like there. And yes, I think with that, Donnie, I will hand it back to you just to close it out.\nDonnie King: Alright. Thank, John. We are building a world-class business organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean and thank you to everyone on the call for joining. Earlier today, we announced our first quarter 2023 results. We delivered solid top line results with year-over-year revenue and volume growth and continued strength in our share position, providing momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year. Compared to record performance in the prior year, first quarter earnings declined driven by weaker results in chicken, pork and beef, which more than offset strong performance in Prepared Foods. It's important for you to know that we are uniquely positioned to win in an attractive global protein market. We have market leading brands across diverse portfolio that resonate with consumers as proven by our year-over-year sales and volume growth. We serve an estimated one-fifth of U. S. protein consumption and we are well positioned to meet consumer demand, which remains steady despite a challenging macroeconomic environment with ongoing elevated levels of inflation. As we navigate a complex and dynamic operating environment, I am grateful for our team members whose hard work and dedication make our business operations possible. Five key pillars of our strategy are: transforming our team member experience, growing with our customers to service demand, investing in digital and automation to drive operational excellence, restoring competitiveness in our Chicken segment and leveraging our financial strength to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders. In service of these long-term strategic imperatives, I'd like to emphasize that we continue to deliver on our commitments of growing volume by filling up our footprint, solving labor problems, investing in automation, and building inventory to meet customer demand with improved fill rates all while maintaining a focus on liquidity and financial health. We are confident these investments will pay dividends over the long run and we remain committed to methodically executing our growth strategy driving long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our results and shed some light on some of the challenges and outlook. We went into Q1 with a good plan, but our overall results were impacted by a confluence of factors, including consumer and customer demand dynamics and the curve of the beef cycle, among other things. Allow me to touch on each segment. As we have previously mentioned to you, we have been expecting beef to come under pressure for some time. With higher cattle prices, we expected overall harvest to slow down, but that hasn't happened yet. As such, we continue to draw on the herd, which continues to decline. This is putting pressure on spread margin in the business. We tightened our outlook range for the year. For pork, when you account for mark-to-market derivatives in the number, we flip back to breakeven as expected, but given continued supply and demand dynamics, we lowered our outlook for the year by 200 basis points. For chicken, when compared to expectations from last quarter, a few different things didn't go as planned. Most notably, demand didn't appear in the parts of the market where we had expected. As a result, we had to move things around and we experienced higher cost, a lower price environment and knock-on effects from a network standpoint. And last, it's worth emphasizing our Prepared Foods segment, which delivered a great result for the quarter. We said we were going to grow dollar share and volume share with the strongest portfolio of brands in the categories where we compete and we have done just that. We are feeling good about the outlook for the balance of the year. And our international business continues to build momentum in terms of volume and sales growth. With the end of COVID lockdowns, particularly in China, we expect good year-over-year comps. We will dive deeper into this during the discussion of segment results and the Q&A portion of the call. Now, let's turn to our growth numbers. Sales improved 2.5% year-over-year. And as we delivered record first quarter revenue for a total company and individually in chicken, Prepared Foods and International Other, we are focused on driving growth in these segments, which will enhance our margin profile over time. We continue to see benefits of our efforts to optimize our existing footprint, add new capacity, adjust our product mix by plant, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. Prepared Foods revenues increased 8.8% for the quarter driven by both volume growth and pricing actions implemented in the prior year. Positive momentum continues to build in Prepared Foods, as it delivered sequential quarterly improvement in revenue since the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the strength of our retail brands. Beef revenue was down 5.6% compared to prior year. Lower average sales price driven by the decreased value of beef cut out more than offset the increased volume from higher headcount throughput. Compared to prior year, pork revenue was down 6% for the quarter. This was driven by decreased volume due to balancing supply with customer demand, partly offset by increase in average sales price. Chicken revenue increased 9.6% compared to prior year driven by volume growth from increased domestic production and pricing initiatives and an elevated inflationary cost environment. In international, revenue growth remained strong, up 11.3% compared to prior year quarter. This was driven by our investment in capacity, innovation and brand to support market share growth. In the next few slides, we will detail our success winning in retail marketplace with our advantaged brands in advantaged categories. The retail categories in which we participate are highly consumer relevant with the vast majority remaining elevated relative to pre-pandemic and demonstrating growth over the prior year. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and BallPark, Tyson core business lines outpaced total food and beverage and our peers in volume growth, up 9% relative to a year ago per Nielsen. Tyson core business lines also grew pound share by 2 points this quarter relative to year ago for Nielsen, continued to be market share leader in most of the retail core categories in which we compete. We delivered both dollar and pound share growth in both the aggregate and across day parts compared to a year ago, most notably in the morning meal occasion. Our brands continue to perform well as we see elasticities below historical levels. Additionally, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and BallPark, all hold favorite brand status with consumers in the categories in which we compete, highlighting our brand strength relative to our peers. Consumers spend on relevant categories and brands they know and trust. The trajectory of our Tyson Core business lines volume share growth shows, the recovery we have seen since April and the momentum we now have. We have improved fill rates and on-shelf availability. Price gaps relative to competitors have narrowed while we continue to invest in merchandising and advertising to support our brands. These factors, along with other strong business fundamentals, resulted in sequential quarterly share growth in Tyson core business lines commanding a 5-year record high market share of nearly 28%. It is evident we are delivering the brands and products that consumers desire. While the foodservice industry is yet to recover to pre-pandemic traffic levels, the Tyson Focus 6 group is outperforming pre-pandemic volume sales, up 2.7 and 1.7 share points in the latest 52 weeks according to NPD SupplyTrack data. The Tyson Focus 6 group is also outpacing both total broadline and its respective categories, up 11.7% in volume sales and 0.6 share points in the latest 52 weeks compared to last year per NPD. We believe strongly in our foodservice portfolio and are confident in the path to continue to grow this business as we align with key growing customers to build momentum for the future. Our team members are essential to providing the products our customers and consumers' demand. We are seeing business results from making significant investments to become the most sought after place to work by investing in our team members' experience. Recent highlights include expanding access to benefits with Day 1 eligibility, enhanced parental leave policies, expanding mental health benefits and citizenship support at no cost to our U.S. team members. In November, as recognition for our Tyson immigration program's commitment to improving the lives of immigrant team members, we received the prestigious Keepers of the American Dream award from the National Immigration Forum. We also just completed what we have been calling Project Next Frontier. We are setting the foundation for an HR shared service model focused on process and system efficacy and better overall HR service delivery for our team members, setting us up for savings in the future. I am pleased to report we are also progressing as expected with our North American headquarters consolidation focused on building our OneTyson culture. In addition to realizing savings, we are collaborating, innovating and working with greater speed and agility to serve our customers. I would also like to thank our team members for their dedication that led to Tyson Foods number one ranking on Fortune Magazine's list of the world's most admired companies in food production category for the seventh consecutive year. Following the strong outperformance of expectation in fiscal 2022, the productivity program is on track to meet expectations this fiscal year and to deliver the $1 billion of recurring savings commitment a year earlier than originally promised. We expect this program to translate from a onetime initiative to sustained year-on-year productivity improvements, supporting our bottom line on a continued basis. Examples of initiatives in our productivity program include leveraging data analytics to improve inventory visibility, mitigating distressed pounds, a direct plant shipment program, which continues to bring on new customers and categories, removing miles from the roads and driving efficiency in our distribution network. This is an example of how our scale drives competitive advantage. Investing heavily in automation, we recently rolled out automated sandwich hand wrap and burrito assembly capabilities as well as an automated line to serve snacking production. We have also continued to scale our chicken debone automation across multiple facilities and we are piloting a robotic tray pack machine that is showing promising results, expanding our smart factory program to digitize our plants to new sites as well as exploring opportunities to digitize our processes. Our progress displays how Tyson remains focused on optimizing our business processes, digitalizing the supply chain increasing automation and aggressively managing SG&A across our operations. Before I turn the call over to John to walk us through more detail on our financial results for the quarter some final comments. Our segments individually and in aggregate have clear and compelling roles within Tyson's portfolio strategy to deliver sustainable, high-quality growth at good value. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio across proteins and channels around the world. We have products for consumers across proteins and price points, delivering performance that supports the company's long-term earnings objectives and desirable return for shareholders. We are modernizing our operations with our productivity program and are building a team positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. Again, we entered Q1 with a good plan to execute our strategy. That led to solid top line growth and strong performance in Prepared Foods. Market dynamics and some operational inefficiencies impacted our profitability. We see opportunities to become more agile and efficient, which will further improve our operational execution. We remain committed to executing our growth strategy and are confident we will grow volume, revenue and operating income in the back half of fiscal year 2023 and have a long runway of growth ahead of us. With that, I will turn the call over to John. Good morning. Okay. Alexia, thank you and thank you for your question. I'll start out with some broad comments, and we will get a little more tactical as it relates to chicken and then wait to your next question. But I would just simply tell you that Q1 was a very challenging quarter for us is the confluence of several external factors across all businesses. We saw market swings across all businesses and they were unpredictable and sizable. While we have opportunities to perform better and you would never hear me say anything other than that. This is the first time I've seen all markets work against us all at the same time. It's the first time I remember market impacts being greater than those controllables that we have and the opportunity for improvement of them. As we think about moving forward, efficiency in our operations and our company will be a focal point for us. There are some places where we need to make decisions faster and, in some cases, better decisions. In some cases, we will need to adjust our business model. And in other cases, the accuracy of our projections has to be better than what we've demonstrated here in Q1. I'd remind you and everyone else that we're not bigger than the market. And in Q1 and over time, markets will do their job, and we simply have to do ours. Q2 will be seasonally softer than Q1, and the back half will be better than the first half. While the back half will be better than the first half, we feel good about our business outlook. For example, we knew the beef herd is nearing the bottom of the cycle. We knew pork had heard health issues and that there would be incremental packing capacity coming online and it did. We did not expect the incremental beef, pork and chicken in the marketplace domestically in Q1, especially in light of the fact that the cost of animals and the cut out of the pricing was declining. Our Prepared Foods performed as expected, delivering on operating income. We grew share in both dollars and pounds in the quarter. And I would just \u2013 I have to remind everyone else before I get into chicken in the details is that we have a strong diversified portfolio, and we have confidence in our multi-protein strategy that it will deliver growth and shareholder value. Now let me go a little deeper as it relates to chicken, and we perhaps can go even deeper or later. In chicken, we have a differentiated model. We have the number one brand in chicken. We've talked often about the fact that our model doesn't get the highest or lows of the commodity markets. This does not mean we're not impacted. For example, we talked a lot about variable pricing models, we have those. And \u2013 but I would remind you that those pricing models have lags as well. As we started this year in chicken in particular, we had a good plan. We still like our chicken business, but there were a lot of moving parts in Q1. So what happened in Q1? Our volume was up 3% and our harvest pounds were up 15%. This is due to a mix shift from small bird bone-in to more of a boneless product, and it was part of our strategy. Our supply plan is dictated by our demand plan. This is a core tenet of our business. We plan for a strong November and December. If you'll remember, for fresh chicken, if you remember, we shorted fresh chicken in the last 3 years in a significant way, and we had a plan in place this holiday season to not have that happen again. November and December were softer than we expected or planned for in retail fresh chicken. This created excess in our retail fresh chicken. Because of sales didn't materialize in retail fresh. This triggered a resale or movement of products. The resale price was much lower than modeled for the original sale. So to help you a little bit, I would say, just to dimensionalize this, that about two-thirds of our miss was market-driven and about third of the miss was related to labor, yield and spend, some of which was associated with the movement of product because of the miss on fresh chicken, the movement of product from one location to another impacted labor, yield and created incremental freight costs. We also had some knock-on effects of building inventory as a result of this, inventory above our plan. And as a reminder, avian influenza impacted our pricing and volume on both cost and chicken leg quarters in the quarter. There was more chicken, beef and pork in the market than anticipated. So it sounds like a lot of excuses there. I get that. So what now what, so what are we doing? I'd tell you that we still have a great chicken business. We still have a good plan. We are cleaning up and have been cleaning up some issues from Q1 that I've talked about earlier. So as we think about from this day \u2013 or since Q1, we have to control the controllables. I would remind you that we are fully staffed, and we continue to invest in a better workplace experience through automation, etcetera. We are growing our business, servicing our customers and becoming the most sought-after place to work and we will compete with the very best in the chicken space. So, let me pause and get a follow-up question and we will go from there. Alright. Thank you. I will \u2013 I'll start out on this, and then I will flip it to Brady for a few comments. We're moving closer to the bottom or to the trough of the beef cycle. We obviously were surprised at the amount of beef harvested in our Q1. There was a lot more beef on the market than what we had expected particularly in light of increased pricing \u2013 or excuse me, increased cost of cattle and at the same time, a decline in cut out. So that was a bit of a surprise to us. That's a miss for us. But we are moving closer. We know that there are more hoppers being harvested. We know there are more cows being harvested. We know what those signs are that we are looking for in terms of when the herd would rebuild. And it's going to require a rain or precipitation. It's going to require the rancher to see more forage in hay. Availability, those are some of the things you need to look for. But as we've gotten a quarter closer to answer your question, Alexia, we \u2013 we see a little more clearly than now. We know that the trough is coming, but we wanted to \u2013 the number you see is a conservative number for us and making every effort to make sure that we guide you to where we see Q2 and the balance of the year going. And so Brady, let me see if you want to add anything to that. Welcome, Brady Stewart. Sure, Ken. I'd be happy to \u2013 David Bray was leading our poultry business. And I talked about in Q1 that we had some issues as it related to markets and the amount of protein on the market. The change that we made is a result of some of the controllables that I think we made some good decisions. I'd like to have seen those decisions faster and perhaps some better quality of decisions and there were things in Q1 as it relates to chicken that we could have done better. And I made the change. I went out immediately and recruited Wes Morris, who Wes has had has run many parts of our Chicken business. He's led our Prepared Foods business, and he's also led our Case-Ready beef and pork business. And they had an opportunity to pick up a great talent with many, many years of experience and know-how in this business, and we made the change. In terms of the overall organization, Shane Miller leaving our pork \u2013 or excuse me, our beef and pork business, our fresh meats business, the relocation got change. Shane is still actively engaged in the company. He and Brady are working through a transition. And so we \u2013 when Shane decided he could not move for reasons. By the way, Shane is still trying to figure out how he can get here and be a part of it. There are some personal things that he's got to deal with. But we were fortunate to pick up Brady Stewart, who is the COO of another company, and he's well versed in the pork business and the packaged meats business and could do a number of roles for us going forward. We're very fortunate to be able to pick up both Wes and Brady in our organization, and we look for great things from them. But we've got a lot of upside and runway in the organization because of them. Recently, we announced Amy Tu leading our international business, along with a few other functions. But we're excited about Amy and what she's doing and her passion for the international market and her passion for growing Tyson in international markets. And I feel really good about where we are from an international perspective. I feel really good about where we are from a chicken perspective and the leadership there. I feel really good about where we are from a beef and pork perspective. If you click down one level as it relates to beef. That team is largely intact moving here, and some have, in fact, already moved here. So Stewart, you saw the numbers in Prepared Foods. Stewart has done a really nice job of challenging the business and upgrading pork raw material into this branded portfolio that we have. And then finally, today \u2013 actually today, Melanie Boulden is joining us. And so why Melanie and why a Chief Growth Officer, it was all in an effort to try to get a center of excellence here in Springdale, Arkansas around branding, marketing, communication and innovation. And Melanie has got great experience in consumer packaged goods and most recently, Chief Marketing Officer in a food and beverage company. So I'll pause and take a breath right there, Ken, and wait for a follow-up. Thanks, Ken. We do appreciate the interest in our International business. I would tell you that we've invested a great deal in plants. And with COVID over the last year, particularly in the foodservice channel, we've had some headwinds with that. Those have lessened. And we're in a sweet spot there in terms of our alignment with global customers, many of which are in the food service channel. But we also have launched a branded portfolio across Thailand, Malaysia and China. And we feel good about that. It's \u2013 they are doing \u2013 the brands are doing really, really well and provide not only innovation or outside the U.S., and we also take that innovation and we add that and we bring some of those things back to the U.S. But we feel good about it. It's been an investment. It's been a long time coming, but I think you will see here in \u201823, our international business delivered some really nice results for in the way of operating income. Amy, anything you would like to add to that? Hi, Ben. Thanks, Ben. I will make a few remarks, and then I'll pass it to Wes for a little more detail. As I said in my opening comments to \u2013 also in the first question, we still feel really good about our chicken business. We think we have a good plan. Yes, we got hitting the mouth in Q1 because of all the protein on the market in Q1. And our tray pack, our fresh chicken business did materialize as we had expected. And so we kind a created \u2013 we created our own issue with that because of what happened in the market. But I would tell you, we still have tremendous opportunity and upside as we execute this business. And it's nothing exciting, but it's the fundamentals of labor and yield and spend and just maintaining growing this business to fill up our capacity and service the needs that we have. And I would remind you that you and everyone else that we place chickens based on what our demand plan looks like is in service of our demand plan. So as we go back and look at what happened in Q1 and think about the future, in Q1 strategically, the only thing that went awry was the fact that the demand didn't materialize in the place at retail in which we thought it would. And so that triggered a number of other inefficient moves and activities. But again, we think Q1, you've seen the numbers, Q2 is seasonally softer. But as we start getting towards the to that Q3 time period, we feel good about it, and we don't have something that's broken here that like a hatch issue and a genetics issue, the time horizon for fixing this is much shorter than many of those things. Wes, anything you want to add to that? So let me make a comment, and then I'll flip it over to Stewart. In terms of prepared, we did deliver what we said we would in Q1. We feel good about that on a go-forward basis with these iconic billion-dollar-plus brands that we have, we feel good about that. Stewart said in the last quarter that retail was really, really good, and we had some work to do as it relates to the food service side. And of course, we're still not back to pre-COVID levels in the food service channel. And so there is some upside for that opportunities when that happens, but we need more demand there. I would tell you, even in all of that we continue to grow our share in the foodservice prepared and poultry business. But Stewart, why don't you add some color to this? Let me make a few comments, and then I will let Wes add some color to this. The miss for us was clearly in our fresh chicken, our tray pack chicken at retail. That was where we stumbled. The demand for our branded retail products was very good, demand for our foodservice chicken products were all very good. The thing that has exacerbated this was the amount of overall protein in the marketplace in Q1, beef, pork and chicken. While our harvest pounds were up 15%, remember that we are converting all those pounds into a boneless form, right. That's different. That's a mix shift and a strategy change as we get out of some of the more small bird, whole body, 8 Piece type products. We talked about that last quarter. We have moved into a boneless mix in that area. And we have got more to come as it relates to that. But Wes, why don't you cover some of the details? Sure, Adam. So, I have said earlier that as a way of a reminder that we start with a demand plan and that over the past 3 years, we have not been able to service the demand in fresh chicken at retail. We were trying to correct that at this point. And every demand signal we had said that the demand was going to materialize and we place chickens accordingly. Remember, we placed those chickens for that November timeframe back in August. And so we were going \u2013 I understand your point about we are in November and we are having the last earnings call. A lot of things from that day forward, the demand didn't show up in fresh chicken. A lot of the other things worked exactly the way we planned for them. And \u2013 but that trigger, if you think about fresh chicken, you typically put that products in a tray and then before you have the order. And when the order doesn't show up, then you have to take it out of the tray or sell it in the tray at a discounted or in a distressed fashion. We had a lot of that in our Q1. And we have cleaned up that. We are still trying to get ourselves going back again. Q2 is going to be seasonally softer, variable pricing models and the lag associated with that. I mean we will get caught up with that. The back half of the year, we feel good about where we are going to be relative to that. And so Wes, that's I think the first question, what about the second one? So, let me make sure I separate it for you. Great question, by the way. One is head and one is weight. The 15% is weight. The head is different. We have talked in terms of in fiscal \u201823, by the end of fiscal \u201823, we would be at about 42 million head a week. And that's still the plan. I would also tell you that the plan is \u2013 I mean, the demand is there to support 42 million chickens a week. And if that changes, we will change. But that's what we see right now as we look at the demand picture. The other thing that I think that \u2013 and I will just say it as we talked about the beef cycle and the pork cycle and herd health and so forth, I think it's \u2013 if you look at what happened in Q1, I think every chicken company in America, read the headlines around there is going to be less beef, less pork, and the natural belief is that chicken will fill that gap. But the problem with all of that is there wasn't a gap in beef and pork in Q1. And so I think you are seeing even now based on the numbers that Wes quoted earlier, you are seeing adjustments in the marketplace relative to that. And \u2013 but we will always balance our supply with what our demand needs are. And I just \u2013 it's just the fundamental tenet of how we operate this business and have operated for many years. I think you are spot on relative to that. And you are \u2013 I think you are already seeing adjustments in terms of the supply plan. I would tell you and I don't want to mislead you or anyone else on this. There is some, there is unusual erratic to describe a behavior as it relates between channel swapping and even parts of the store and how \u2013 what's going on there. Swapping between proteins, all the normal things that you would know from all your years of covering this protein sector, they are all in play. But I think this is \u2013 I think in Q1, this was a supply issue first and foremost. Secondly, there was some shifting in what part of the store and what products were purchased. Sure. I will start and then offer it up to anyone else that may have something to add. But I think it's \u2013 if you look at the information that we see, it says the consumer is working through savings. In the middle of the pandemic, they were able to bank a lot of savings. And over the last little bit they have been working through that savings. And I think many consumers are now out of that \u2013 those savings and/or at least nearing the last of it. And so I would expect the consumer to be under more pressure as we move forward in this year. And \u2013 but I would also remind you that as a company, if you look at our brands and we cover the spectrum across proteins. We have a product for every consumer across various proteins and price points. So, we feel very good about the fact that we can intersect with that consumer wherever they are. And that's I think a good position to be in and are the best position you can be in. And so we will see how it turns out. But we don't know any more about that than you do today. Yes. I mean it's I wish I could be here before you today and tell you I knew when that was going to happen. But there is kind of some prerequisites before we are going to see [indiscernible] retention, which is going to be driven by better precipitation, getting past the drought and for ranchers to see to have hay that's more affordable and forage land to be able to feed those animals. I don't think you are going to see [indiscernible] retention in a meaningful way until those things occur. And I have listened to every expert that's been through all of these cycles through all of these years. And I have been through a couple of them myself. It's I get a number somewhere between the spring of \u201823 and the spring of \u201824. And that's how variable it could be. What I can tell you is the harvest of [indiscernible] and the harvest of cows continue. And in a lot of cases, people are paying up for those animals to sell them at a \u2013 for a lesser cut out. So, that's what I can tell you about it, Brady, anything you would add to that? Yes, I will make a few comments, and Brady can step in on this. I mean I think you have described it very well in terms of what the levers are here. Everything you have said I think I agree with what you have said and how you characterize it. And you have also described this future state where there will be more packing capacity with fewer animals. And so if you build the capacity, these are \u2013 for these large plants, you can spend $1 billion to build the beef plant. So, if you spend $1 billion to get a beef plant, you are going to process animals. And so that could all likelihood drive up the price of the cattle that are available at that point. But you are going to get some pushback with the consumer if you try to cover that or try to get cut out to cover that. So, I see all the same pressures and dynamics that you just outlined. And it's going to take a bit to rebuild the herd. And once we get to whatever the bottom is, I mean we are looking at 2-plus years to be able to see some better times. Brady? Alright. Thank, John. We are building a world-class business organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Goodbye."

            "name": "Brady Stewart",
            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. And certainly, your points relative to cattle availability and the look into the future is spot on the drought, lack of affordable hay and forage and higher overall supply chain costs are still driving cal liquidation in parts of the U.S. as we move out of this cycle of the cal liquidation and start to see some [indiscernible] replacements into the future, we will certainly have better visibility to the trough that you mentioned as well, Donnie. Why I am optimistic about the future? Is the team has worked diligently and effectively to strategically align ourselves with suppliers to ensure we have the supply required relative to higher grading cattle. We feel good about global demand, specifically on higher-grading beef products from a macro standpoint. We're seeing some appreciation in drop credit values, specifically on specialty products, including fats and oils. And while it is hard to pinpoint the exact bottom based on the current drought and feedstock conditions, we are seeing some moderation and some signs of optimism relative to the drought conditions that we will keep an eye on moving into the future. No, Donnie. Donnie, I think you covered it very well. We have a different situation today than we have in the past as well relative to some of the interest rate pressures. That certainly will have an impact as these ranchers decide to retain [indiscernible] as well. So, that coupled with some of the weather and impacts that we see certainly create the uncertainty that you outlined. Thanks for that, Donnie. I think there is a couple of other factors that we need to consider as we come out of the cycle. And one of them is certainly relative to export demand. And we have seen an increase in terms of demand from our export partners relative to higher grading cattle. I think that is an anomaly relative to cycles that we have certainly seen in the past, and it's something that we will be watching as well. Now, we have seen the strength that I mentioned earlier relative to some of the drop values in byproducts as well. So, certainly combining not only the supply factors that you touched on from a live cattle perspective, but also the demand factors that are going to come into play from both our export customers and our domestic customers is certainly a focal point for us."

            "name": "Wes Morris",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning, Ben, and thanks for the opportunity. First, let me say how excited I am to be a part of Tyson Foods. This is a great chicken company. It's got great people, great brands, great customers. And I want to echo what Donnie said around, we did a lot of foundational work and executed it very well. We said that we would improve our capacity utilization. We would staff our plants and they are at a record staffing level. We've added automation and got some opportunities as we start up that that negatively impacted our yield in Q1. And then we said we'd rebuild inventory post COVID to better service our customers and our order fill rate indicates that we did that well. And so from a live perspective, we performed very well. The volatility of our hatch numbers are behind us, and we did exactly what we said we were going to do on the live production side. And so that allows us to focus more of our energy on standing up that automation to its expected results. And to make sure we're still meeting the needs of the consumer. But the one thing that's obvious we can do better is understanding the consumer shifts in our business and making sure we got the right amount of birds in the right place at the right time. Yes. Adam, thanks for the question. Like I said before, we executed our live plan very well and did exactly what we said we were going to do. We did have a strategic mix change and had less bones. And then one of the other drivers was the impact of our sales of 2% to 2.5% of a lot of chicken depending on what size. Rebuilding our safety stock inventory. And then the seasonal increase in inventory to supply wings to the marketplace. But Adam, the way I would ask you to think about it is at a macro level, we did a very good job, and we absolutely had the right number of chickens. We simply had them in the wrong place based on the post-COVID changes. And so we had more than we needed in our fresh chicken business and came up short in some other areas. Yes. Optimistic about the path forward, the USDA is projecting Q2 numbers around 2%, which is a lot less chicken availability than the 77 increase we saw in Q1. Then when you couple that with 4% to 5% less cattle, you should have an overall protein per capita that is much smaller than what we saw in Q1. We are already seeing some changes in the marketplace. Since the end of the quarter, we have seen boneless go up the quarter. Wings are up around $0.14, $0.15. And so optimistic going forward that the chicken values will correct. We have talked about variable pricing on a lot of these different calls. And the good news is it's much, much faster than the historical 1-year fixed price agreements. But unfortunately, it still has a short-term lag as these markets correct, it will take a minute to hit the self sheet."

            "content": "Thanks, Donnie. First, let's review a summary of our total company financial performance then we can dive deeper into the detail for the individual segments. As Donnie stated, sales were up year-over-year for the first quarter, benefiting from both volume growth and disciplined revenue management to offset elevated inflationary increases in our cost of goods. Looking at our sales results by channel, retail drove $324 million of top line improvement led by Chicken and Prepared Foods. Our industrial and other channel sales increased by $108 million, led by beef and chicken and this was offset by slight decreases in sales to the foodservice and international channels. As expected, given the record strength of beef a year ago, we delivered lower adjusted operating income in the prior year of $453 million. This translated to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.85. Now, turning to the adjusted operating income bridge, we significantly grew Prepared Foods earnings in the quarter, but underperformance in chicken, pork and beef led to $979 million lower operating income compared to the prior year. While pricing actions led to an improvement of $222 million, higher input costs per pound increased cost of goods sold by $1.3 billion. About two-thirds of this increase was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and supply chain costs. The remainder was primarily due to a shift to producing more value-added mix, higher labor costs and unfavorable derivative impact. Excluding the impact of restructuring, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was down to 3.7% from 4.3% in the prior fiscal year as we continue to eliminate non-value-added spend across our business while investing to support the future growth of our brands. Our productivity program continues to play a critical role in the long-term improvement of our margin profile. Now to the individual segment results. Starting with the Beef segment, sales in the quarter remained strong at more than $4.7 billion, but were down 5.6% compared to record high sales in the prior year. Volume gains of 2.9% were supported by improved staffing for higher throughput, while the average sales price was down 8.5% due to softer domestic demand for Beef. Live cattle costs increased approximately $530 million in the quarter as cattle supplies continue to tighten. Net-net, segment operating income for beef was $129 million for an operating margin of 2.7% off the previous year's historical record first quarter margin of 19%. We saw higher cattle prices as beef herd numbers continue to decline. We will continue to monitor the beef cutout value and balance our supply with customer demand during a period of margin compression while pushing volume growth in case-ready and premium branded products. Although the near-term operating environment remains challenging, we have reasons to believe in our long-term outlook for beef. This outlook is supported by our investment in strategic supplier relationships that provide higher quality beef, a growing global demand, specifically in Asia, and the strengthening drop credit as well as opportunities to shift our beef products up the value pyramid. Now, let's look at the Pork segment. Sales were approximately $1.5 billion for the quarter, down 6% for the record high in the prior year. Average sales price gains of 1.4%, mostly driven by higher value specialty products were offset by volume decreases of 7.4%. International demand for U.S. pork products continues to be impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, while domestic demand is being affected by high retail prices despite the cutout realigning to historical norms. However, we are optimistic that when these factors normalize, demand will improve. We expect to see continued industry supply challenges in the fiscal year as the producer navigates herd health issues and higher input costs. On expenses, we incurred greater cost as lean hog costs increased approximately $55 million over the prior year. We also experienced an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of $35 million. Segment operating income was lower than expected at a loss of $19 million for the quarter, down from a profit of $160 million in the prior year. As we move forward, pork margins should be supported over time with the normalization and the strength of the U.S. dollar aiding future export demand, a strengthening drop credit and additional opportunity to shift pork products up the value pyramid, especially into our case-ready business. Now, let's move on to the Chicken segment's results. Sales were a record first quarter high at $4.3 billion, up 9.6% from the prior year. The sales increase was attributable to a 2.5% uptick in volume and 7.1% gain in pricing compared to the prior year quarter. Volume gains are due to a combination of strategic choices to maximize our capacity utilization and pursue an optimal mix strategy with products and customers. Our pricing results while improved were lower than expected. We pegged this to a combination of factors that influence chicken prices, mostly related to total protein availability, notably chicken and beef. We anticipate these factors easing in the back half of 2023 as beef availability lessened and total poultry harvest normalizes, providing support for improvement in our chicken prices. The fall in commodity chicken prices driven by heightened protein supply in the market and seasonal demand weakness does not change our strategy. Based on current USDA industry placement data, we are optimistic on our forward-looking supply conditions in the intermediate term. We intend to grow our domestic production to 42 million head per week during this fiscal year, which should enable us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume and gain market share. We will continue optimizing our plant network and portfolio mix to maximize the profitability of our Chicken segment, particularly by growing our portfolio of value-added products, which remain in high demand. Operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $225 million of higher feed ingredient costs and an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $40 million. Net-net, our Chicken segment delivered operating income of $77 million in the first quarter. We see significant room for improvement in the long-term operating margin of our Chicken segment as there is still work to do to attain industry leading performance and we are optimistic it can be achieved due to the following: our diversified value-added portfolio with lower margin volatility, our brand strength with the highest consumer awareness and brand loyalty according to Nielsen data, our growth strategy, taking advantage of existing capacity, optimization of our portfolio by shifting from commodity to value-added products, and last, a further implementation of our productivity program as we ramp up more automation. Last, I want to turn to our Prepared Foods business. In this segment, we had a solid quarter with growth in both revenue and volume. This was driven by strong brands, increased support for our customers and pricing aimed at recovering the continued inflation. Revenue was approximately $2.5 billion for a record first quarter, up 8.8% compared to the prior year. Volume gains of 1.2% were driven by strength in retail, notably Jimmy Dean and improved customer fulfillment despite decreased volumes in foodservice. This quarter was our third sequential quarter of volume growth and we saw significant pricing power of our portfolio with a year-over-year increase of 7.6%. Driven by top line growth and productivity savings, we delivered segment operating income of $266 million for the quarter. The operating margin of 10.5% was up from 8% in the prior year. We are very pleased with the performance of this quarter in Prepared Foods, as this segment is critical to drive profitable growth for Tyson by valuing of Beef, Pork and Chicken commodity meat products. We continue to be optimistic for the outlook of this segment due to the following. Our diversified portfolio meets consumers across meal eating occasions and snacking occasions in all sales channels. We are outperforming our competition in retail with room to grow further market household penetration. Our comprehensive foodservice portfolio has opportunity to grow by regaining lost customers and broadening our customer base. We have got additional operational efficiencies to unlock by increasing plant utilization in addition to the implementation of our various productivity initiatives. And finally, we have an opportunity to innovate, expand and acquire into new spaces through new offerings, the growth of our existing products, and attractive disciplined approach to M&A. Now, turning to talk about our financial position. Building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy. We produced operating cash flows of $762 million for the quarter and our leverage ratio finished the quarter at 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our commitment to a sound balance sheet. Focused primarily on new capacity and automation objectives, we invested nearly $600 million into our business in the first quarter to capitalize on projected demand growth over the next decade. Investment in the business, both organically and inorganically, is expected to generate returns at or above our 12% return on invested capital target over time. Our capital allocation priorities are first to invest in growth and productivity in our existing footprint. Then we will employ a disciplined M&A approach by investing in opportunities that fit well with our existing portfolio. Next, we remain focused on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Notably, we will continue to support and grow the dividend for our shareholders as evidenced by its continuous payment since 1977 and annual increases each fiscal year since 2013. Our approach to share buybacks will continue to be managing for dilution and entering the market opportunistically when assessing for multiple factors. We returned nearly $500 million in cash to shareholders in the quarter through $169 million in dividends and $313 million of share repurchases. At Tyson, we utilize a disciplined capital allocation approach to invest in our business for both organic and inorganic growth and we returned cash to shareholders while maintaining a robust balance sheet. Now, let's turn to the fiscal 2023 financial outlook. We are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $55 million to $57 billion, which implies a 3% to 7% sales growth for the year. Supported by the factors detailed earlier, we expect future Beef segment margins to be in a normalized range of 5% to 7% in the long-term. However, based on current market dynamics, we now expect to perform between 2% and 4% this fiscal year. Given the result in pork in the first quarter, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between 0% and 2%. Counter to normal seasonality for our pork segment, we expect the back half of the year to outperform the first half of the year. For our poultry business, we now expect full year margins to be between 2% and 4%, but gaining momentum through the year and exiting the fourth quarter at a margin above this range. Prepared Foods had a strong first quarter in performance as this is historically normal seasonality for the segment we are maintaining our expected full year margin performance to be between 8% and 10%. In international, we continue to see volume and sales growth year-over-year, and we anticipate improved profitability in fiscal 2023, driven by volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up. We remain committed to growing our business internationally, representing the fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. Our expectation for CapEx for the remainder of the year is unchanged at approximately $2.5 billion. Our expectations for productivity savings remain unchanged at $300 million to $400 million. Our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $330 million and 24%, respectively. We remain committed to our investment-grade rating and managing our net leverage ratio to be at or below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA over the long-term, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders. In summary, we had a slower start than expected, but are optimistic on the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and long-term. We have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity and a differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace. Overall, we see some persistent market factors, some operational challenges, and some expected seasonality influencing our second quarter results. And therefore, we're expecting total company volume, revenue and operating income to be meaningfully stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. We remain in the strong financial position to support continued investment in our existing footprint, productivity and the support of our brands as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders. So with all that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. Good morning. Hey, Ken, Also, this is John. And I think it's just worth pointing out. The business has been profitable over the last few years. And on an EBITDA basis, we look at something in the high single digits for that. So I think there is financial performance to support the continued investment there, but at the right... Hey Adam, this is John, too. I think there is just a couple of other things that we have said that are worth reemphasizing. One is, and I think you asked a good question about, hey, what was going on, you have talked to this last time in November. I think in addition to all the poultry dynamics that Donnie was described here, I think there is still different of outlook as it relates to beef availability, which I think was maybe a little bit of a surprise. And then I think as it relates to the outlook for the year, if you just look at kind of what the public data says, I think it's something like 25% to 30% more chicken meat in the freezer. And so our plan is to account for working through that, but it does take some time to work through that. And there are timing differentials between how the market recovers and where our pricing recovers. So, all of that influences just the shape of the year for us. And I think we have also said this, but just to make sure the listeners on the call get it today, Q2 will be softer for us in Q1. And we expect to see a recovery in what is our Q3 and Q4, the second part of our fiscal year. Thank you. And our next question today comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hey Ben, this is John. I think maybe just a couple of comments headlining on kind of how we are using hedging and derivatives as it relates to a risk management kind of overarching strategy. Generally speaking, what you would expect from us is to kind of have coverage in the near-term, coordinated with what our sales picture looks like with customers. And we really use it as a margin management tool more than any type of speculative tool. And so I think that just emphasizing that last point, we would not project any \u2013 there is no outside best sitting out there in terms of what the markets are going to be doing. We kind of keep things in close and use it more from a margin management standpoint. Yes. I would add two things to what Donnie is saying. Number one, if you think about the kind of prepared and retail branded side of our business, we have been paying attention to what the consumer is doing and feeling over the last few quarters and we continue today. I think the good news is even in these times where the outlook for the economy is evolving, we have had pretty steady growth and pretty strong performance in that part of our business, which tells us that while, yes, there may be a lot of behavioral changes going on in the economy, we see consumers come into the brands and the categories that we are in repeatedly. So, I think we feel good about that. On the second point I want to make is from a \u2013 how to say it, the supply and demand balancing on the kind of fresh and frozen more commodity protein side of our business, has more influence on how we are performing than does the macro situation because people are going to continue to eat protein. They may cut back on other things, but food is not one of them. Sure. This is John again. And just a couple of things to wrap up on. We want to make sure we got to cover with you before I hand it to Donnie to close it off. I think the first thing, if we think about the top line guidance that we have given, our outlook there is probably in the bottom half of that range just to kind of crystallize where we are today. And I think the second thing is we didn't really have to touch on capital allocation today, although I know it's a point of interest for many folks. And our capital expenditure outlook for the year is firm at or around that $2.5 billion number. But I think what we would guide to as we look forward, that's probably the high watermark. And for us, our priorities are kind of preserving financial strength and flexibility, investing for returns in our business and then after that, being disciplined on M&A, dividends and share repo. So, I just want to make sure people understood kind of what the outlook was like there. And yes, I think with that, Donnie, I will hand it back to you just to close it out."

We've talked about in the past where global population growth will happen and will happen outside the United States. And so we're taking our existing footprint right now. We're putting in place the kind of execution fundamentals that we need to have. And then we're also discussing with our other segments, the opportunities that lie before us, given the raw materials that we have here in the United States. But Donnie just put forward exactly what we have outside the United States with our strong brands. We are launching smart factories. We are able to do things more quickly outside the United States which will give us ultimately a benefit for the entire company. So more to come, but we are very excited about what we see right now."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Donnie\nDonnie King: Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results. Performance in Q4 was strong. In fact, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share were both the best results in the past eight quarters, and both more than doubled compared to Q4 last year. The momentum we've built led to significant improvement in full-year profitability in 2024. For the year, AOI of more than $1.8 billion, nearly doubled versus fiscal 2023, while adjusted EPS of $3.10 increased more than 130%. We're clearly pleased with our performance this year, where a significant turnaround in chicken combined with strong results in prepared food and improvements in pork offset well-known challenges in beef. Our disciplined capital allocation drove strong cash performance in 2024 as well. Free cash flow increased by more than $1.6 billion versus last year and came in at more than twice the dividend this year. This result was driven by increased AOI and prudent CapEx management, while still investing for profitable growth. Overall, our financial health strengthened significantly from where we ended fiscal 2023. Each of our team members across the organization contributed to this strong performance in 2024. I'm very thankful for the hard work they do every day to make us a world-class food company and recognized leader in protein. I want to point out that beyond the results in fiscal 2024, we're providing guidance for fiscal 2025, which builds on our momentum. At the midpoint, AOI is growing and our financial strength is improving. It's important to note that our guidance at midpoint for prepared food and chicken reflects AOI expectations of more than $2 billion combined. Our outlook for next year highlights the benefits of our multi-protein, multi-channel portfolio. Our strategy remains the same and reflects the continued focus on our business fundamentals. Our priority on controlling the controllables has clearly delivered positive benefits in fiscal 2024 and we expect that to continue in 2025. I want to emphasize that I remain optimistic about our future and I am highly confident in our ability to drive long-term value for shareholders. Let's move to segment highlights, starting with prepared food, which has been a solid and stable driver of profitability. AOI results for the quarter and the year came in just as we expected, with the midpoint of our segment guidance remaining constant all year. FY '24 AOI grew 2% year-over-year and was the best performance since fiscal year '18, overcoming headwinds of startup costs at our new Bowling Green plant in a challenging consumer environment. Overall volume grew nearly 1% as we continue to broaden our customer base and expand our presence in broad line distribution categories. Moving to chicken, AOI results came in above the high end of our most recent guidance range. While we benefited from lower grain costs, our focus on the fundamentals of live operations, where hatch and livability again improved year-over-year in Q4, and plant efficiencies also contributed to the strong results for the quarter and the year. It's clear that we've built a fundamentally stronger chicken business as evidenced by the significant turnaround in AOI from fiscal '23 to '24, which was our best full-year AOI performance in the past seven years. While results in beef were better than anticipated for Q4, we continue to see compressed spreads versus last year, driving the decline of profitability for both the quarter and full year. Obviously, the current cattle cycle remains challenging as there are no clear signs of sustained herd rebuilding intentions. We will remain focused on the things we can control as we've managed through it. Turning to pork, improved spreads highlighting herd health and solid demand drove a $270 million year-over-year increase in AOI for fiscal '24. As I mentioned, our focus on controlling the controllables has produced solid results for fiscal 2024, and we expect this to continue. We have five strategic enablers that drive our priorities for 2025 and beyond. This is our roadmap for success, and we're building on this foundation. Let's look at our enterprise priorities for 2025. Operational excellence never gets old or goes out of style. For us, a key element of operational excellence is gaining enterprise scale and unlocking savings in our controllables by modernizing our operations and driving performance to standards. You've seen the benefits of this in our results for 2024, and we've embedded this approach in our guidance for 2025 across the business with a noticeable impact in prepared foods. As we are in service to our customers and consumers, we are building on our iconic brands to value up our core proteins. We have three of the top 10 brands in protein behind Tyson, Jimmy Dean, and Hillshire Farm. While our brands are healthy, we have opportunities to expand our household penetration by better serving consumers with innovation for new meal locations, categories, and channels. One of the ways we will achieve our strategic goals is by investing in our digital capabilities, utilizing big data, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence for better decision-making and outcomes. Our data and digital delivery priority enables improved yield and mix across many of our operations and is important as we modernize customer engagement and drive consumer insights. We are accelerating digitalization in our end-to-end demand and supply planning, becoming platform-driven with an exception management strategy that optimizes working capital. Capital allocation is an important strategic priority that unlocks fuel for the enterprise. As Curt will elaborate on shortly, we made tremendous strides in our cash management in '24, and we plan to be just as disciplined in '25 with a continued focus on managing CapEx and working capital to drive free cash flow. Importantly, we're focused on team member development as the foundation of our planned delivery and to build on our strong history of our winning culture. With these strategic priorities outlined, let's move to our segment priorities for the next year, starting with prepared foods. There is significant opportunity to drive profitability in prepared foods by operating with an increased level of discipline, increasing throughput and yield by performing to standards, eliminating waste, reducing complexity, and continuing to improve service levels. Our focus on data analytics drives insight into consumer preferences, as well as disciplined investment to support and grow our core products and drive innovation. As an example, Jimmy Dean is one of our strongest brands, but there is still room to expand its appeal and market opportunities in adjacent morning eating occasions. To capture trends towards spicier foods and convenience, we recently launched Spicy Chicken Honey Biscuits, a restaurant-quality breakfast sandwich. We previously mentioned the success of our grill cake platform, which has strong customer adoption and repeat rates. We're leveraging the success of these innovations and further leaning into our other top-performing SKUs to capture opportunities to expand distribution. Moving to chicken, there's no clear demonstration of the benefits of operational excellence than the efficiencies we drove in chicken in fiscal '24. We plan to sustain and improve our live and plant operations and maintain a disciplined S&OP process in 2025. As you've seen, when our live operations are running well and our demand plan is more accurate, we can operate much more efficiently while better servicing our customers and reducing inventory, all in support of generating more stable and predictable results. At the heart of our strategy lies a commitment to long-term partnerships with strategic customers. By fostering these collaborations, we ensure stable demand for our products and create mutually beneficial win-win relationships focused on growing the category with our customers. Next, I want to touch upon how we can build value through investments in our branded and value-added chicken portfolio. Tyson holds the number one brand position in value-added chicken across both retail and food service. Over the past year, we've made significant investments to enhance and expand our portfolio of high-quality, innovative, and convenient products. We're also excited to debut our revitalized packaging, which reflects Tyson's relentless focus on quality and generates consumer excitement. The new packaging rollout in October coincides with the launch of our new Tyson-branded advertising campaign, Always Been Tyson. More broadly, our fully-cooked portfolio is a high-ROI area where we will continue to deploy capital to expand our market presence and maximize returns. For example, we accelerated the ramp-up of our new Danville facility this year and are now exploring our next Danville-scale operation. This approach not only strengthens our financial performance, but also solidifies our competitive positioning in the industry. As you know, our beef business is challenged by the dynamics of the current cattle cycle. Our focus for FY'25 and beyond is to build a best-in-class operation so that we are well prepared when the cycle turns as we fully believe it will. At the same time, we continue to align every aspect of our operations from procurement, where we are strengthening our relationship with key suppliers, to production and distribution to meet customer and consumer demand. In addition, we continue to improve our cost structure with tight spend management and increased efficiencies while enhancing yield and mix to add value. We're meeting consumers' demand for convenience with an expanded assortment of pre-seasoned beef available in a variety of new flavors and forms. We are a leader in beef, and we want to be a valued partner for our customers by having the right product at the right time to meet their needs. We made good progress on operational improvement in our pork business in fiscal '24, which allowed us to capture the benefits of a better market condition, and we expect to make incremental progress this year. The network optimization initiative we completed in '24 is expected to drive better capacity utilization and allow us to improve our mix by leveraging the capabilities of our remaining plants. We're also scaling up our use of data to make better decisions on mix and to improve yield. Like beef, our pork team has been expanding our portfolio of seasoned and marinated products to drive increased value-added offerings while strengthening our partnership with key customers. Across the business, our focus on controlling the controllables can drive sustainable cash flow, better operational execution, and improve mix and deliver a solid performance in fiscal 2025. Before I hand things over to Curt to review our financials in more detail, I want to share the positive results from the execution of our strategy, demonstrated by the momentum of our value-added businesses in prepared foods and chicken, while we are also managing through and acknowledging the challenges of the current beef cycle. As our value-added businesses grow and drive a larger portion of our profitability over time, we should expect a more stable earnings profile. Looking at prepared foods in fiscal '24, we delivered AOI growth of over $100 million as compared to the five-year average from fiscal '19 to '23, and its share of overall profitability has increased from a quarter to a half. Additionally, at the midpoint of our fiscal '25 guidance, we're also expecting nearly a $100 million increase in earnings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt.\nCurt Calaway: Thanks, Donnie. Total company net sales were up 1.6% year-over-year in Q4 and 0.8% for fiscal '24. Beef and chicken were the primary drivers for the quarter, while beef and pork led the sales increase for the full year, partially offset by chicken. Q4 adjusted operating income of $512 million, margin of 3.8%, and adjusted EPS of $0.92 were the strongest quarterly results this year, all more than doubling versus Q4 of '23. And as Donnie mentioned, the best performance in the past eight quarters. Full-year AOI of more than $1.8 billion, nearly doubled, and adjusted EPS of $3.10 grew over 130%. Significant improvement in chicken profitability was the largest driver of year-over-year growth for both the quarter and the full year, with contributions from prepared foods and pork offsetting declines in beef. Now let's review our segment results for Q4. In prepared foods, Q4 revenue declined 1.2% versus last year, driven by lower retail volume. It's worth noting that we continued to make progress in total volume growth outside of retail in both Q4 and fiscal '24. As we expected, AOI in Q4 increased noticeably year-over-year, benefiting from lower raw material costs, operational efficiencies, and reduced MAP spending as we have focused on reducing inefficient support costs. These drivers also contributed to the best full-year AOI performance in the past six years, overcoming startup costs and unfavorable mix. Moving to chicken, sales in the quarter increased 2.3% inclusive of a legal contingency accrual recorded in Q4 last year. While volume declined modestly year-over-year, it grew approximately 1% versus Q4 of fiscal '22, as we continued to better align supply and demand. AOI increased $281 million versus last year to $356 million. Lower input costs, net of pass-through pricing, and improved operational efficiencies and execution drove the growth in AOI. For the year, chicken AOI improved by nearly $1.1 billion, leading to the strongest AOI performance since fiscal '17. In beef, revenue is up 4.6% year-over-year in the quarter, primarily due to volume, driven by higher average carcass weights and higher head throughput. While revenue increased, AOI decreased, primarily reflecting compressed spreads as expected. Moving to pork, Q4 revenue decreased 3.7%, driven by lower pricing on dropped credit items, partially offset by increased volume. AOI increased $27 million year-over-year, benefiting from improved operational execution. For the full year, AOI increased $270 million, highlighting improved spread. Shifting to our financial position, our commitment to disciplined capital allocation remains constant. Our priorities are to maintain financial strength, invest in the business, and return cash to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. Full-year cash flow from operations increased nearly $840 million, driven by improved profitability and working capital management. Operating cash flows of $2.6 billion was more than double our CapEx, which came in at just over $1.1 billion for the year, reflecting our disciplined capital deployment while continuing to invest for profitable growth. Fiscal '24 free cash flow improved by more than $1.6 billion year-over-year. This increase was driven by roughly equal contributions from higher operating cash flow and lower CapEx. Free cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion was more than 2x our total dividend. As you saw in our earnings release, we raised our dividend for the 13th consecutive year, reflecting confidence in our cash flow generation. We remain committed to the dividend as our primary way of returning cash to shareholders. Additionally, we ended the year with $4 billion of liquidity after repaying our 2024 senior notes in August for $1.25 billion. Net leverage declined again sequentially, ending the fiscal year at 2.6x. This is a full one and a half turns of improvement versus where we exited fiscal '23. We've made good progress, but continue to focus on returning net leverage to our long-term target of at or below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our plan for fiscal '24 was to apply our controlling the controllables approach to improve our financial strength. As you can see in our free cash flow and net leverage performance, we've clearly over-delivered on that plan and remain committed to deploying resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now let's look at our guidance for fiscal '25. We anticipate sales dollars to be flat to down 1%. We expect volume growth in chicken and prepared foods to be offset by lower beef and pork volumes. However, total company AOI is expected to be between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, reflecting approximately 10% growth at the midpoint driven by prepared foods and chicken. Rounding out key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $380 million and our tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. As Donnie mentioned, we're going to maintain tight controls on spending and CapEx to be between $1 billion and $1.2 billion this year. While there are a range of outcomes for AOI, we expect our free cash flow to exceed $700 million, which is approximately our new expected annual cash dividend. Moving to the breakdown of total company AOI by segment, starting with prepared foods. While we don't anticipate material changes in consumer behavior, we still see a pathway to significant growth in prepared foods AOI by focusing on operational improvements that are in our control, as you saw in our segment priorities for fiscal '25. We expect AOI to be in a range of $900 million to $1.1 billion, representing double-digit growth at the midpoint driven by these initiatives. In chicken, we plan to sustain and build on the operational improvements we put in place in fiscal '24. We are reinvesting a portion of these benefits into our value-added portfolio, highlighted by our master brand relaunch and new marketing campaign. We anticipate chicken AOI to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, highlighting high single-digit growth at the midpoint. Now on to our beef segment, where uncertainties remain, including the timing and pacing of meaningful herd rebuild intentions. These market dynamics are reflected in our range of outcomes for AOI for fiscal '25, where we expect a loss of $400 million to $200 million, which reflect a similar level of profitability year-over-year at the midpoint. In pork, we also expect a similar level of profitability in '25, as in '24, with AOI in the range of $100 million to $200 million. At the midpoint, benefits of our ongoing operational initiatives may be offset by tighter spreads. Our international business made strides in improving operations in fiscal '24, leading to a notable increase in AOI. We expect to make further progress in fiscal '25. Our outlook for the coming year reflects the benefit of our multi-protein, multi-channel portfolio. The middle of our range highlights solid earnings growth and continued progress on our operations and financial strength. Now I'll pass things back to Donnie to wrap up.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Curt. I'm proud of our fiscal 2024 results. We drove significant improvements in our P&L and on our balance sheet. These accomplishments are a direct result of our team's unwavering discipline in executing our strategic priorities. I'd like to take this time and opportunity again to thank each of our team members. Your focus and commitment has been essential to our success. Looking ahead, we still have room for improvement, but I'm optimistic about what's to come. We have a solid foundation as one team, one Tyson, and I'm confident we will continue making progress in fiscal '25, building on our iconic brands to value up our core proteins and striving to operate with excellence. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to welcome Kyle Narron as our new Group President of Prepared Foods. With more than two decades of industry experience, Kyle is a proven leader with strong operational expertise and a deep understanding of our business. As you recall, Melanie Boulden came to us as Chief Growth Officer in early 2023 and shortly after agreed to take on additional responsibilities as Group President of Prepared Foods. I'd like to extend my gratitude to Melanie for delivering the fiscal '24 plan and creating momentum for growth in the future. Her role as Chief Growth Officer remains central to our growth strategy, especially as we move forward with the most robust innovation pipeline in our company's history. Her efforts to deliver continued breakthrough marketing and growth initiatives, including digital enablement, will be pivotal as we bring new consumers to the Tyson Foods portfolio. Kyle's appointment has been a seamless transition. We're confident his experience and leadership will ensure continued momentum for the business. Thank you for your time today and I look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Sean for Q&A instructions.\nSean Cornett: Thanks, Donnie. We will now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Donnie and team congrats on a good finish of fiscal '24, first of all. So, along the line, Q4 obviously was very strong and the full year came in even a little bit better than you expected. You're still calling for some nice growth looking into '25. So, Donnie, maybe help us unpack a little bit the puts and takes within your outlook for '25 and maybe in a little bit more detail what gives you confidence of growth into next year. That would be my first question.\nDonnie King: Sure, and thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with just saying how pleased we are with Q4 and the full year of 2024. We continue to see the benefits of our multi-protein portfolio where chicken, prepared pork, and international are all sitting the headwinds in beef. In Q4, momentum continues to strengthen. We saw significant cash generation with free cash flow more than 2x our dividend and substantial reduction of net leverage ratio to 2.6x. In FY '24, and this is why you should be confident, those enterprise priorities continue to deliver results. Our focus on operational excellence are delivering best-in-class operations by gaining efficiency and eliminating waste. Our focus on the customer and the consumer is allowing us to strengthen our iconic brand to expand reach and deliver innovation for new occasions. Our focus on data and digital tools allows us to use big data, analytics, and AI to improve operational decision-making and drive consumer insights and ultimately actions. Our focus on capital allocation is improving cash flow by managing CapEx and working capital. Our focus on team member development is foundational for our culture and delivering our plan. We expect prepared foods and chicken each to deliver approximately 50% of our AOI in fiscal year '25, a significant shift to a more valuable mix. Approximately 10% of our AOI growth in FY '25 at midpoint is driven by prepared foods and chicken. Now into each of the segments, a little color there. In prepared foods, AOI performance was the best full year since 2018. Would expect FY '25 AOI to have double-digit profitability growth at midpoint. In chicken, best full year AOI performance since fiscal year 2017. Market tailwinds and operational improvements driving results. Would expect FY '25 AOI to have high single-digit profitability growth at the midpoint. In pork, better spreads and improved performance drove significant year-over-year AOI increase. Would expect similar profitability at midpoint in '25. In beef, spread compression continues driven by a tight cattle supply but would expect similar profitability at the midpoint. In international, a nice improvement, a nice AOI performance taken with the 4Q one-time adjustments. Would expect FY '25 AOI performance to continue to improve as execution and capacity utilization improves. In total, would expect FY '25 AOI growth to be 10% at midpoint on a range of 1.8 billion to 2.2 billion. Now, five key takeaways from Q4 and as we think about '25. We will continue to shift our mix from core protein to branded value-added. Number two, we will increase household penetration in branded and value-added. Number three, protein is part of every healthy diet and protein is a clear winner in food. Number four, we will improve the returns on our invested capital and create shareholder value. And number five, we will execute with excellence in all that we do. In terms of just one adder here, in terms of volume for the year, we expect beef based on tight cattle supplies to be volume to be down slightly. Pork, because of some of the network optimization, should be down slightly. We would expect increases in volume in prepared foods chicken. So, that's the breakdown on the mix. With that, I will turn the question back to you, Ben.\nBen Theurer: All right. That was very complete. One quick one on chicken, and this is really just like kind of maybe stretching a little bit of the expectations here. If we go back 12 months in time, you were kind of looking for maybe up to 700 million in AOI for chicken, and then it turned out to be more than a billion in FY '24. So, as we think about this, and obviously how the market conditions performed over the last couple of months and quarters now, how much of that do you think you can potentially carry over? And what are potential upside scenarios that would take you even beyond the current chicken outlook of call it maybe 1.2 billion at the higher end?\nDonnie King: Ben, I would just say we have a fundamentally different and better chicken business than we had even a year ago, certainly two, three years ago. But our guidance for '25, the range is from 1 billion to 1.2 billion, which is really a high single-digit growth at midpoint. We're doing that at the same time we're investing back in the business with the new ad campaign, product innovation, and so forth, something on the order of about $100 million. So, with that, Wes, do you want to add anything?\nWes Morris: Yes, I'd love to. Ben, thank you for the question. And let me give you a little background so that it'll clear up a little bit. And I'd like to answer specifically your question around '25. And so, we executed our strategy in '24. It was a great team effort as we drove over a $0.5 billion in operational improvement across live plants and then matching up our supply and demand. And so, we delivered our strongest Q4 in history. But here's the part that most people don't know. While we were working on the cost side, we were also resetting the stage for the revenue side and winning with consumers. And so, Donnie mentioned our number one shared retail value added. We did a complete do-over in which we upgraded our quality to the point that our testing exceeded consumer expectations. Not I like it, but it exceeds my expectations. We've got a big innovation pipeline, both experimental and better for you. And experimental is form and flavor, what I call where food meets fun. And then the better for you is capitalizing on the protein content. We upgraded our packaging and it's based on basically decision trees of shopper's shop, brand, and then form and flavor. Donnie referenced our new advertising campaign. And what's exciting about that is that campaign resonates with our core shopper. Just as importantly, it resonates with the younger shopper, creating sustainability of demand over time. And so, we do have a stronger business and an impressive leadership team. We're well positioned into '25 and beyond to have a successful, sustainable business. And let me make one more comment about commercial, because that's something we've not talked about on the calls and a big step change going into '25. Our speed and improvement and go-to-market has been greatly increased. And so, business growth and R&D are a highly functioning team to not only understand them by consumer needs, but to create products and get them to commerce quickly. We've got the strongest pipeline of new products that I've seen in my career across any segment. And so, with that, let me transition to your question around 2025 outlook and how good is the number. And let me start with, hey, last year, my team surprised me with the speed and intensity of the improvement, right? So, yes, we did say 700, and we continued to perform faster and better than I anticipated. We think we've got good balance, good analytics, and good insight into what 2025 looks like. I'm very encouraged by 2025 as we've got a good team, we've got better fundamentals. Overarching markets appear stable. We've got a plan, performance improvement plan more than offsetting inflation. Then we'll spend around $100 million driving that mixed change of value added. And while our volume looks a little soft, last year, our fully cooked mix was up 5%. So, we've already started that mix adjustment to improve profitability. And so, all-in-all, we got a better cost structure, we got strong value added go-to-market hitting with a lot of intensity in 2025. And so, our guidance based on current market outlook, understanding we're more insulated than most companies, I feel good about. Now, we also think we're realistic about the macroeconomic impact of total demand, what's the industry supply potential, any impact to exports, ongoing weather patterns, which seem to be more frequent, and feed costs and global feedstocks. And so, we feel very good that based on what we know, our guidance is more accurate than any time in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead.\nHeather Jones: Congratulations on the quarter. My first question is a follow-up to Ben's. As far as on the chicken guide, I was you all have made a lot of changes in your operations there. You've pulled some complexes. So, I was just wondering if you could give us a little more specificity as far as your year-on-year growth for that cycle. How much of that is, things that [TyChic] [ph] in control as far as cost savings, more productivity, and how much is it you're assuming as far as the overall market dynamics?\nDonnie King: Sure. I will tell you that the chicken business is performing. Wes, just a moment ago, talked about a number of those things. Think of this as a continuous mindset, continuous improvement mindset, operational excellence. Those are the gifts that keep on giving, if you will. And for us, that's not going out of style. And we'll do many of those same things as we here in 2025. We're off to a good start in 2025. Wes, why don't you touch on some of those specifics around controllables?\nWes Morris: Yes. I think in an effort to keep it fairly simple, if you use 2023 as a baseline, we have materially made a step change that has nothing to do with markets of over $500 million, right? We know where the continuous improvement opportunities are from there. So, I'm going to bake in another 185 that has nothing to do with markets. And so, we've made a major step change that regardless of meat values or corn values, those fundamental improvements are worth between $500 million and $700 million a year.\nHeather Jones: That's super helpful. And then, my follow-up is on beef. And basically, production there, just due to new feed additives, longer time on feed, just production has come in much higher than anyone would have expected this year. And those weight gains are likely to continue in 2025. So, given that we haven't had this hole in supply that was expected, the wholesale price gap between chicken and beef has been pretty narrow, as narrow as in two years, whereas the retail price gap is the highest ever. And so, just wondering what you all are hearing from retailers, given that supply has not been as bad as people thought, is there a possibility that retailers start promoting beef more at the expense of chicken in 2025? So, would love your thoughts on that.\nBrady Stewart: Well, good morning, Heather. Appreciate the question. It's Brady. First of all, I think it's really important to point out just where we sit from a beef demand perspective, just kind of set the stage. And when we look at '24 versus '23, we saw it from a choice cutout perspective increase just relative to the wholesale price as well. And it was up a little more than 2%, which signals really good beef demand. And we've seen that in our business as well. Then when we go and we kind of dissect it by primal and by product, it gets a little bit more interesting as well. And so, really kind of flattish prices across the board on the rib and lion. But we've seen a significant increase in price on the grinds. And so, I'm not sure that every single one of the products on beef is really a clear substitute with chicken and with pork. But where we have seen that increased demand in price has really been on lean trim. It's been on the grind. And we've seen some substitution opportunities between the round complex and the lean complex as well. From a retailer perspective, we have seen several different strategies deployed. And because we've seen the steady demand for beef, we know that the consumer is going to stay in there, continue to buy beef. And so, some retailers have certainly taken that promotional opportunity to work on that rib and loin complex to drive those market baskets higher in general. So, I guess the overarching sentiment, just relative to beef, is really good demand, even with these higher prices, and expect that to continue into 2025.\nWes Morris: Hi, Ms. Heather. This is Wes again. And I was so focused on the cost side of your question, I think I should have mentioned a big unlock on the revenue side as well as we go into 2025. So, as you know, we opened five fully cooked wines in our Danville, Virginia, new plant earlier in 2024. Through great efforts from both retail and food service, that plant is actually sold out. And so, that mixed change that I referenced earlier, also changing economics, is baked into our 2025 plan. And I'm excited to announce that we're already starting to work on the next five fully cooked wines.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. I'll stay with chicken. And thank you for all the help, both of you, in terms of the mixed changes and, Curt, in terms of some of the permanent dollar changes to your operating income that you would expect. I wanted to ask, though, is it possible that there's a potential partial offset coming in the next year just from higher supply? And I know we're getting some mixed signals there, but we have seen chick placements increase to some extent. I'm just curious, not trying to rain on what's a pretty great parade here, but just wanted to get a sense for what's in your guidance for potentially higher industry chicken supply in the coming months.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Ken. Let me start out and answer that question. And if we want to go into more detail, I'll give it to Wes. But I would tell you in our guidance that 1 to 1.2, we have contemplated all those things that you just mentioned. So we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given. I think one thing that I'll just add to in terms of how this mix is shifting for us, not only in chicken, but for the other businesses, but for chicken specifically today. If you look at volume, while it is positive or projected positive for '25, what you don't see in that is this, that the outsized growth of the value-added branded business is up about 5%. Thus, we're filling up the Danville, Virginia plant, and then we're looking at another plant to do that. So what we're doing in shifting this core or commodity into more value added is working, which has been part of the Tyson history for many decades now. And so we'll do more of that. And we're aware of the market conditions, but we're trying to operate and be a company that is a little different in terms of what we do.\nWes Morris: Yes. I'll share my perspective. If I could, I'll share my perspective real quick. We see the record exits, and I think it's reflecting strong demand for poultry, plus the industry's continued challenge in hatch and livability. Fortunately, Tyson's performance has dramatically outpaced the industry. We're able to service our customers. We referenced the 2.6% increase for the full year. But given the robust demand, I think there's good reason to believe that supply and demand are fairly balanced. But I want to be clear on something that we talk about internally. We really grow chickens for two reasons. We don't grow a lot of chickens to sell for whatever they're worth next Wednesday. We grow a lot of chickens for strategic customers to create win-win solutions who are looking for a continuity. And that has built-in mechanisms that if we perform, we make money. And then the second reason we grow chickens is as ingredients to our fully cooked and par-fry business, which we're growing exponentially. So the industry will do whatever it's going to do. I think we're well-positioned to win either way.\nKen Goldman: Thank you. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, you have a new administration coming in the White House. I think a lot of uncertainty, maybe both on the upside and downside. I'll leave this question open-ended, but just in terms of labor tariffs in both direction, regulations, is it possible to even analyze what might be some upside and downside drivers at this time, or is it just way too early to say?\nDonnie King: Well, there's a lot that we don't know at this point, but I would remind you that we've successfully operated this business for over 90 years, no matter the party in control, the environment. We look forward to working with the incoming administration. Like all businesses, we'll assess any new policies and plan accordingly. So we're going to control, again, what we can control in this environment. So I'll leave it at that Ken.\nOperator: The next question comes from Pooran Sharma of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nPooran Sharma: Congratulations on the strong quarter.\nDonnie King: Thank you.\nPooran Sharma: I was hoping just to gain a little bit more clarity for myself on beef and kind of your outlook, and more specifically, just wanted to understand just heifer retention or herd rebuilding dynamics. I understand we haven't seen that yet, but just looking at your guidance at the midpoint for beef, we're kind of looking flattish. My understanding is if you see signs of heifer retention, you are going to see the number of head going to slaughter plants going even lower, which fundamentally to me would put more compression on margins. Does the lower end of your operating income range factor in potential heifer retention? Or help me kind of think about potential heifer retention in your beef outlook for next year.\nDonnie King: Sure. Let me start off with that. In terms of the guidance, we're guiding to a loss of $400 million to a loss of $200 million. So the challenge continues. But as I mentioned earlier, this 2025 will be similar based on all of our modeling to '24. There's some influx, yes, heifer retention, and we're not seeing meaningful heifer retention. But there's also the influx of heavier weight cattle. There's the influx of some dairy into the supply and a number of other things. I'll flip it to Brady to let him give you some of the finer details of that.\nBrady Stewart: Sure. Thanks, Donnie. I think it's also important to understand what Tyson can control. I'm proud of the team relative to some of the improvements we made in '24. To have operating costs in our plants that are lower in '24 versus '23 when we saw some inflation and some lower headcount numbers is really meaningful to the outlook of our business as well and provides some visibility in terms of where we can control. This is one of the most dynamic beef environments in history, and we've gone through these cycles approximately every decade. But this one's really unique, and we've seen record cutout prices, some record weights that you referenced as well, and how all of these different pieces shape into the outlook is very interesting. So we've layered on a significant amount of data platforms to help us analyze our business better than we ever have before and make better business decisions that really drive outcomes that are important and meaningful And so from a cutout perspective, I mentioned earlier that we've seen really, really good demand, and we need to continue to understand that that good demand and really high cutout values provides greater importance now on our yields than it ever has in the history of the business as well. And so there's initiatives to continue to move forward and continually improve in that area as well. Grind is very, very important. I mentioned the record high prices we've seen on lean trim. How we convert lean trim into chubs or patties or their grind material to meet the consumer wherever they want to go is a good opportunity for us, and we've seen great initiatives and move in that area. Donnie mentioned the seasoned marinated progress, and we want to provide convenience to our customers as well and provide different platforms for them to purchase our beef products. Really proud of the team to continue to innovate and come up with different solutions for the future. And then just lastly, I just want to go back and reiterate the efficiency improvements that we have made year-over-year are absolutely meaningful as well and will help us navigate through whether we start to see additional heifer retention and potentially some lower harvest numbers, or it's more of a static demand case.\nPooran Sharma: Great. No, I appreciate it. Thanks for the color. I guess for my second question, just kind of wanted to shift over to the work you've done to optimize your network. If maybe you could just remind us of all the work that you have done, how many plants you've closed, and then do you see further kind of work being done? You guys are really kind of seeing benefits from operational excellence. So just want to kind of get a sense for how you're thinking about it in the future.\nDonnie King: Sure. Great question. And I won't hit on every specific location, but I will tell you how we start. We start with controlling the controllables in the business. And then we began, as many have talked today, about executing with excellence. We simply want to be best-in-class operations end-to-end. I don't care if it's chick or beef, pork prepared, international, or a function across Tyson Foods. So let's start with that. So when we look at the network, we consider a number of things. We consider the age of the asset. We consider the profitability of an asset. We consider the scale of an asset. We consider how competitive it is in the marketplace. Can it win? And we also then look at what future capital would be spent on that particular asset. And as we run all these things through a funnel, we make a long-term decision. And I must tell you, these are always challenging, painful decisions to make. But I think we have demonstrated the ability to look everywhere, to challenge ourselves to be the best, and then make decisions accordingly based on what we find. Operator Our next question comes from Thomas Palmer of Citi. Please go ahead.\nThomas Palmer: I was hoping to get a little more specific on the expected drivers for prepared foods. Sounds like mix is a factor. I wondered maybe about your outlook for other items, anything maybe quantifiable on volume expectations, and then kind of thinking about cost inflation and productivity. And then just kind of in context to that expected improvement in prepared foods, would you expect to see this 10% operating profit growth starting in the first quarter, or is there a period later in the year where we might see outsized growth? Thanks.\nDonnie King: Thanks. Yes, great question, and thank you for that. I would remind you that in 2024, it was the best year we've had since 2018. I've said on calls, this call before, that there's upside to our prepared foods business. What we are doing, what we did in 2024, 2023, and we'll do in 2025 and beyond, is continue to drive out waste from our business. We'll continue to connect with that consumer and our customer with new and meaningful innovation. I've talked about what protein impact is and where it sits relative to inside the category of food, but we're literally pulling every lever within prepared foods. We're already seeing benefits of that. We saw it in 2024. We see that momentum continuing in 2025 and beyond. And a reminder, we're at midpoint. We are expecting a 10% growth from 2024 to 2025. Now let me introduce you to Kyle Narron, who now leads our prepared foods business. Thank you, Melanie, for outstanding 2024. And Kyle, give us a little more color relative to the question.\nKyle Narron: Yes, thanks, Donnie. And thanks, Thomas, for the question. As I look at 2024, we were entering the beginning of our multi-year strategy focused on operating our business with discipline, and that's exactly what we did, as Donnie mentioned, the best performance in six years and in line with expectations. I guess I'll start by thanking all of our team members for their contribution to the improvements that we recognized in 2024. The key drivers for that performance were really along three pillars. Our operational performance is delivering tangible results. We experienced significant improvements in yield and throughput. Our service levels improved over 170 points year-over-year. Distress sales down 26%. When you look from a commercial execution perspective, we're delivering some sizable wins. We continue to see distribution increases across our core business, gaining over 240 TDPs on our core items that have proven to add value to our customers and consumers. We continue to see momentum from an innovation perspective relative to the launch of our Jimmy Dean griddle cakes and our chicken biscuit. We continue to realize increased distribution on those items on the backs of high trial and repeat rates. And then we continue to leverage our data and digital to drive promotional efficiency and long-term share growth. And so, as I wrap that up, Thomas, and I think of the momentum we carry into 25, which would be year two of this multi-year strategy, I would just call out that over 100% of the step change in profitability is built on controllable improvements. Those key drivers will remain unchanged. We will continue to be focused on the growth initiatives that I mentioned on core distribution and launching items from our robust innovation pipeline. And from an operational perspective, we are laser focused on our performance to standard. We'll continue to focus on running our assets at standard on every line every day. We'll continue to be focused on reducing complexity and eliminating waste. And so, again, expect to carry that momentum that we gained in 24 into 25 as we continue to execute this multi-year strategy.\nCurt Calaway: And, Tom, this is Curt. I might add just on top of Kyle as well. Part of your question, I think, was around kind of the cadence that you might see it materialize. I think this would be a year where it might be a little more balanced across the year, different than kind of more of our historical norms, a little bit of seasonality, which is really what Kyle was speaking about relative to the operational efficiencies we continue to gain throughout the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: I just wanted to come back to chicken supply. I know you gave some thoughts on how you're factoring that in and thinking about it. I guess just would love to follow up on you cite the USDA expectations for around 3% supply growth. More recently, we've seen that the egg set and chick hatched up closer to 6%. Do you expect that to come in? I guess, how do you think about just reconciling those two data points?\nWes Morris: Yes. I'd be glad to take that. And good morning, Michael. The industry's continued challenges on both hatch and livability. These increased egg sets and chicks placed physically aren't making it to the processing plants. And so, that makes a big difference. It's been a much tougher grow out environment between avian influenza, metapneumovirus. And so, I think you'll continue to see that disconnect as we go through 2025. The only offset being in higher bird weights, and that's actually driving the 2.6% increases through bird weight per head.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, that's helpful. And just back on prepared foods, I know you're lapping the plant startup costs. Can you just help us remember how to quantify that?\nKyle Narron: Yes, thanks for the question, Michael. Startup cost year-over-year, or what we realized in FY '24, was somewhere around $20 million. But I would remind you, certainly, that we would be lapping a first half with lower depreciation from an overhead perspective as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Strelzik: My first one, I wanted to go back to some of the operational improvements in the beef segment that you're talking about. My understanding or assumption was that there wasn't a whole lot internally that you could do to really cushion against the market environment. But you sound more optimistic on that now, and certainly listed a number of things that you've been working on. So, I was just curious if you could quantify how much you think that can move the needle, similar to what you said in chicken, or just maybe give a framework for how that could impact the business relative to kind of underlying margin environment.\nBrady Stewart: Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew. Just relative to how we look at the business, 85% of the business really is somewhat uncontrollable relative to these market spreads. And so, that obviously provides some outsized weighting. But when you talk about the amount of resources that we deploy from a labor perspective, the amount of opportunity we have at $3 plus cutouts to continue to improve on yield, it's certainly meaningful on how we push forward and move forward in the business as well. And so, I'll just say that there's a great opportunity for us to continue to march forward towards world-class. We want to make sure that we minimize the losses in this challenging cycle. And we really have the right to win relative to the utilization of our six harvest assets as we move forward throughout the bottom side of this cycle.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And my other question is just on capital deployment and cash flow generation, I guess. Leverage has been coming down. I know you're not quite to the target levels yet, and this will be still a pretty disciplined year. I guess I'm just curious if the business is headed in the direction that it seems to be. Are we getting closer maybe next year to a time when maybe you can start to loosen the purse strings a little bit on that front? Or how are you thinking about whether it's CapEx or other investments returning cash to shareholders kind of more broadly over the next several years? Thanks.\nCurt Calaway: Thanks for the question. And I appreciate the comments. And we certainly did have a very disciplined approach from cash, cash deployment scenario in 2024, and drove net leverage down from 4.1x to 2.6x across the year. But we did still invest, $1.1 billion in CapEx. And at the guidance range that we've provided for next year, we would invest between $1 billion and $1.2 billion in CapEx in 2025. And we also had a comment in our guidance relative to free cash flow that would exceed our annual dividend, expected to be in the range of about $700 million. But we'll stay very constant relative to our capital allocation priorities around build financial strength, but also investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders, as you said. And obviously, make note, we did increase our dividend announced this morning, as well. And very proud of the accomplishments we've made, but we stay committed to our investment grade credit rating, and our long-term target leverage of at or below two times.\nDonnie King: So, Andrew, if I could, just maybe one additional comment, just to make sure the takeaway from the first question I answered this morning, we will continue to spend capital and return money to shareholders. But one of our focal points right now is to improve the return on the capital that we have already invested. And so, there's a lot of upside in that. And so, that's also a priority as you think about this in terms of the whole mix.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Donnie King for closing remarks.\nDonnie King: Thanks for your continued interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kyle Narron",
            "content": "Yes, thanks, Donnie. And thanks, Thomas, for the question. As I look at 2024, we were entering the beginning of our multi-year strategy focused on operating our business with discipline, and that's exactly what we did, as Donnie mentioned, the best performance in six years and in line with expectations. I guess I'll start by thanking all of our team members for their contribution to the improvements that we recognized in 2024. The key drivers for that performance were really along three pillars. Our operational performance is delivering tangible results. We experienced significant improvements in yield and throughput. Our service levels improved over 170 points year-over-year. Distress sales down 26%. When you look from a commercial execution perspective, we're delivering some sizable wins. We continue to see distribution increases across our core business, gaining over 240 TDPs on our core items that have proven to add value to our customers and consumers. We continue to see momentum from an innovation perspective relative to the launch of our Jimmy Dean griddle cakes and our chicken biscuit. We continue to realize increased distribution on those items on the backs of high trial and repeat rates. And then we continue to leverage our data and digital to drive promotional efficiency and long-term share growth. And so, as I wrap that up, Thomas, and I think of the momentum we carry into 25, which would be year two of this multi-year strategy, I would just call out that over 100% of the step change in profitability is built on controllable improvements. Those key drivers will remain unchanged. We will continue to be focused on the growth initiatives that I mentioned on core distribution and launching items from our robust innovation pipeline. And from an operational perspective, we are laser focused on our performance to standard. We'll continue to focus on running our assets at standard on every line every day. We'll continue to be focused on reducing complexity and eliminating waste. And so, again, expect to carry that momentum that we gained in 24 into 25 as we continue to execute this multi-year strategy. Yes, thanks for the question, Michael. Startup cost year-over-year, or what we realized in FY '24, was somewhere around $20 million. But I would remind you, certainly, that we would be lapping a first half with lower depreciation from an overhead perspective as well."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results. Performance in Q4 was strong. In fact, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share were both the best results in the past eight quarters, and both more than doubled compared to Q4 last year. The momentum we've built led to significant improvement in full-year profitability in 2024. For the year, AOI of more than $1.8 billion, nearly doubled versus fiscal 2023, while adjusted EPS of $3.10 increased more than 130%. We're clearly pleased with our performance this year, where a significant turnaround in chicken combined with strong results in prepared food and improvements in pork offset well-known challenges in beef. Our disciplined capital allocation drove strong cash performance in 2024 as well. Free cash flow increased by more than $1.6 billion versus last year and came in at more than twice the dividend this year. This result was driven by increased AOI and prudent CapEx management, while still investing for profitable growth. Overall, our financial health strengthened significantly from where we ended fiscal 2023. Each of our team members across the organization contributed to this strong performance in 2024. I'm very thankful for the hard work they do every day to make us a world-class food company and recognized leader in protein. I want to point out that beyond the results in fiscal 2024, we're providing guidance for fiscal 2025, which builds on our momentum. At the midpoint, AOI is growing and our financial strength is improving. It's important to note that our guidance at midpoint for prepared food and chicken reflects AOI expectations of more than $2 billion combined. Our outlook for next year highlights the benefits of our multi-protein, multi-channel portfolio. Our strategy remains the same and reflects the continued focus on our business fundamentals. Our priority on controlling the controllables has clearly delivered positive benefits in fiscal 2024 and we expect that to continue in 2025. I want to emphasize that I remain optimistic about our future and I am highly confident in our ability to drive long-term value for shareholders. Let's move to segment highlights, starting with prepared food, which has been a solid and stable driver of profitability. AOI results for the quarter and the year came in just as we expected, with the midpoint of our segment guidance remaining constant all year. FY '24 AOI grew 2% year-over-year and was the best performance since fiscal year '18, overcoming headwinds of startup costs at our new Bowling Green plant in a challenging consumer environment. Overall volume grew nearly 1% as we continue to broaden our customer base and expand our presence in broad line distribution categories. Moving to chicken, AOI results came in above the high end of our most recent guidance range. While we benefited from lower grain costs, our focus on the fundamentals of live operations, where hatch and livability again improved year-over-year in Q4, and plant efficiencies also contributed to the strong results for the quarter and the year. It's clear that we've built a fundamentally stronger chicken business as evidenced by the significant turnaround in AOI from fiscal '23 to '24, which was our best full-year AOI performance in the past seven years. While results in beef were better than anticipated for Q4, we continue to see compressed spreads versus last year, driving the decline of profitability for both the quarter and full year. Obviously, the current cattle cycle remains challenging as there are no clear signs of sustained herd rebuilding intentions. We will remain focused on the things we can control as we've managed through it. Turning to pork, improved spreads highlighting herd health and solid demand drove a $270 million year-over-year increase in AOI for fiscal '24. As I mentioned, our focus on controlling the controllables has produced solid results for fiscal 2024, and we expect this to continue. We have five strategic enablers that drive our priorities for 2025 and beyond. This is our roadmap for success, and we're building on this foundation. Let's look at our enterprise priorities for 2025. Operational excellence never gets old or goes out of style. For us, a key element of operational excellence is gaining enterprise scale and unlocking savings in our controllables by modernizing our operations and driving performance to standards. You've seen the benefits of this in our results for 2024, and we've embedded this approach in our guidance for 2025 across the business with a noticeable impact in prepared foods. As we are in service to our customers and consumers, we are building on our iconic brands to value up our core proteins. We have three of the top 10 brands in protein behind Tyson, Jimmy Dean, and Hillshire Farm. While our brands are healthy, we have opportunities to expand our household penetration by better serving consumers with innovation for new meal locations, categories, and channels. One of the ways we will achieve our strategic goals is by investing in our digital capabilities, utilizing big data, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence for better decision-making and outcomes. Our data and digital delivery priority enables improved yield and mix across many of our operations and is important as we modernize customer engagement and drive consumer insights. We are accelerating digitalization in our end-to-end demand and supply planning, becoming platform-driven with an exception management strategy that optimizes working capital. Capital allocation is an important strategic priority that unlocks fuel for the enterprise. As Curt will elaborate on shortly, we made tremendous strides in our cash management in '24, and we plan to be just as disciplined in '25 with a continued focus on managing CapEx and working capital to drive free cash flow. Importantly, we're focused on team member development as the foundation of our planned delivery and to build on our strong history of our winning culture. With these strategic priorities outlined, let's move to our segment priorities for the next year, starting with prepared foods. There is significant opportunity to drive profitability in prepared foods by operating with an increased level of discipline, increasing throughput and yield by performing to standards, eliminating waste, reducing complexity, and continuing to improve service levels. Our focus on data analytics drives insight into consumer preferences, as well as disciplined investment to support and grow our core products and drive innovation. As an example, Jimmy Dean is one of our strongest brands, but there is still room to expand its appeal and market opportunities in adjacent morning eating occasions. To capture trends towards spicier foods and convenience, we recently launched Spicy Chicken Honey Biscuits, a restaurant-quality breakfast sandwich. We previously mentioned the success of our grill cake platform, which has strong customer adoption and repeat rates. We're leveraging the success of these innovations and further leaning into our other top-performing SKUs to capture opportunities to expand distribution. Moving to chicken, there's no clear demonstration of the benefits of operational excellence than the efficiencies we drove in chicken in fiscal '24. We plan to sustain and improve our live and plant operations and maintain a disciplined S&OP process in 2025. As you've seen, when our live operations are running well and our demand plan is more accurate, we can operate much more efficiently while better servicing our customers and reducing inventory, all in support of generating more stable and predictable results. At the heart of our strategy lies a commitment to long-term partnerships with strategic customers. By fostering these collaborations, we ensure stable demand for our products and create mutually beneficial win-win relationships focused on growing the category with our customers. Next, I want to touch upon how we can build value through investments in our branded and value-added chicken portfolio. Tyson holds the number one brand position in value-added chicken across both retail and food service. Over the past year, we've made significant investments to enhance and expand our portfolio of high-quality, innovative, and convenient products. We're also excited to debut our revitalized packaging, which reflects Tyson's relentless focus on quality and generates consumer excitement. The new packaging rollout in October coincides with the launch of our new Tyson-branded advertising campaign, Always Been Tyson. More broadly, our fully-cooked portfolio is a high-ROI area where we will continue to deploy capital to expand our market presence and maximize returns. For example, we accelerated the ramp-up of our new Danville facility this year and are now exploring our next Danville-scale operation. This approach not only strengthens our financial performance, but also solidifies our competitive positioning in the industry. As you know, our beef business is challenged by the dynamics of the current cattle cycle. Our focus for FY'25 and beyond is to build a best-in-class operation so that we are well prepared when the cycle turns as we fully believe it will. At the same time, we continue to align every aspect of our operations from procurement, where we are strengthening our relationship with key suppliers, to production and distribution to meet customer and consumer demand. In addition, we continue to improve our cost structure with tight spend management and increased efficiencies while enhancing yield and mix to add value. We're meeting consumers' demand for convenience with an expanded assortment of pre-seasoned beef available in a variety of new flavors and forms. We are a leader in beef, and we want to be a valued partner for our customers by having the right product at the right time to meet their needs. We made good progress on operational improvement in our pork business in fiscal '24, which allowed us to capture the benefits of a better market condition, and we expect to make incremental progress this year. The network optimization initiative we completed in '24 is expected to drive better capacity utilization and allow us to improve our mix by leveraging the capabilities of our remaining plants. We're also scaling up our use of data to make better decisions on mix and to improve yield. Like beef, our pork team has been expanding our portfolio of seasoned and marinated products to drive increased value-added offerings while strengthening our partnership with key customers. Across the business, our focus on controlling the controllables can drive sustainable cash flow, better operational execution, and improve mix and deliver a solid performance in fiscal 2025. Before I hand things over to Curt to review our financials in more detail, I want to share the positive results from the execution of our strategy, demonstrated by the momentum of our value-added businesses in prepared foods and chicken, while we are also managing through and acknowledging the challenges of the current beef cycle. As our value-added businesses grow and drive a larger portion of our profitability over time, we should expect a more stable earnings profile. Looking at prepared foods in fiscal '24, we delivered AOI growth of over $100 million as compared to the five-year average from fiscal '19 to '23, and its share of overall profitability has increased from a quarter to a half. Additionally, at the midpoint of our fiscal '25 guidance, we're also expecting nearly a $100 million increase in earnings. With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt. Thanks, Curt. I'm proud of our fiscal 2024 results. We drove significant improvements in our P&L and on our balance sheet. These accomplishments are a direct result of our team's unwavering discipline in executing our strategic priorities. I'd like to take this time and opportunity again to thank each of our team members. Your focus and commitment has been essential to our success. Looking ahead, we still have room for improvement, but I'm optimistic about what's to come. We have a solid foundation as one team, one Tyson, and I'm confident we will continue making progress in fiscal '25, building on our iconic brands to value up our core proteins and striving to operate with excellence. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to welcome Kyle Narron as our new Group President of Prepared Foods. With more than two decades of industry experience, Kyle is a proven leader with strong operational expertise and a deep understanding of our business. As you recall, Melanie Boulden came to us as Chief Growth Officer in early 2023 and shortly after agreed to take on additional responsibilities as Group President of Prepared Foods. I'd like to extend my gratitude to Melanie for delivering the fiscal '24 plan and creating momentum for growth in the future. Her role as Chief Growth Officer remains central to our growth strategy, especially as we move forward with the most robust innovation pipeline in our company's history. Her efforts to deliver continued breakthrough marketing and growth initiatives, including digital enablement, will be pivotal as we bring new consumers to the Tyson Foods portfolio. Kyle's appointment has been a seamless transition. We're confident his experience and leadership will ensure continued momentum for the business. Thank you for your time today and I look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Sean for Q&A instructions. Sure, and thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with just saying how pleased we are with Q4 and the full year of 2024. We continue to see the benefits of our multi-protein portfolio where chicken, prepared pork, and international are all sitting the headwinds in beef. In Q4, momentum continues to strengthen. We saw significant cash generation with free cash flow more than 2x our dividend and substantial reduction of net leverage ratio to 2.6x. In FY '24, and this is why you should be confident, those enterprise priorities continue to deliver results. Our focus on operational excellence are delivering best-in-class operations by gaining efficiency and eliminating waste. Our focus on the customer and the consumer is allowing us to strengthen our iconic brand to expand reach and deliver innovation for new occasions. Our focus on data and digital tools allows us to use big data, analytics, and AI to improve operational decision-making and drive consumer insights and ultimately actions. Our focus on capital allocation is improving cash flow by managing CapEx and working capital. Our focus on team member development is foundational for our culture and delivering our plan. We expect prepared foods and chicken each to deliver approximately 50% of our AOI in fiscal year '25, a significant shift to a more valuable mix. Approximately 10% of our AOI growth in FY '25 at midpoint is driven by prepared foods and chicken. Now into each of the segments, a little color there. In prepared foods, AOI performance was the best full year since 2018. Would expect FY '25 AOI to have double-digit profitability growth at midpoint. In chicken, best full year AOI performance since fiscal year 2017. Market tailwinds and operational improvements driving results. Would expect FY '25 AOI to have high single-digit profitability growth at the midpoint. In pork, better spreads and improved performance drove significant year-over-year AOI increase. Would expect similar profitability at midpoint in '25. In beef, spread compression continues driven by a tight cattle supply but would expect similar profitability at the midpoint. In international, a nice improvement, a nice AOI performance taken with the 4Q one-time adjustments. Would expect FY '25 AOI performance to continue to improve as execution and capacity utilization improves. In total, would expect FY '25 AOI growth to be 10% at midpoint on a range of 1.8 billion to 2.2 billion. Now, five key takeaways from Q4 and as we think about '25. We will continue to shift our mix from core protein to branded value-added. Number two, we will increase household penetration in branded and value-added. Number three, protein is part of every healthy diet and protein is a clear winner in food. Number four, we will improve the returns on our invested capital and create shareholder value. And number five, we will execute with excellence in all that we do. In terms of just one adder here, in terms of volume for the year, we expect beef based on tight cattle supplies to be volume to be down slightly. Pork, because of some of the network optimization, should be down slightly. We would expect increases in volume in prepared foods chicken. So, that's the breakdown on the mix. With that, I will turn the question back to you, Ben. Ben, I would just say we have a fundamentally different and better chicken business than we had even a year ago, certainly two, three years ago. But our guidance for '25, the range is from 1 billion to 1.2 billion, which is really a high single-digit growth at midpoint. We're doing that at the same time we're investing back in the business with the new ad campaign, product innovation, and so forth, something on the order of about $100 million. So, with that, Wes, do you want to add anything? Sure. I will tell you that the chicken business is performing. Wes, just a moment ago, talked about a number of those things. Think of this as a continuous mindset, continuous improvement mindset, operational excellence. Those are the gifts that keep on giving, if you will. And for us, that's not going out of style. And we'll do many of those same things as we here in 2025. We're off to a good start in 2025. Wes, why don't you touch on some of those specifics around controllables? Thanks, Ken. Let me start out and answer that question. And if we want to go into more detail, I'll give it to Wes. But I would tell you in our guidance that 1 to 1.2, we have contemplated all those things that you just mentioned. So we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given. I think one thing that I'll just add to in terms of how this mix is shifting for us, not only in chicken, but for the other businesses, but for chicken specifically today. If you look at volume, while it is positive or projected positive for '25, what you don't see in that is this, that the outsized growth of the value-added branded business is up about 5%. Thus, we're filling up the Danville, Virginia plant, and then we're looking at another plant to do that. So what we're doing in shifting this core or commodity into more value added is working, which has been part of the Tyson history for many decades now. And so we'll do more of that. And we're aware of the market conditions, but we're trying to operate and be a company that is a little different in terms of what we do. Well, there's a lot that we don't know at this point, but I would remind you that we've successfully operated this business for over 90 years, no matter the party in control, the environment. We look forward to working with the incoming administration. Like all businesses, we'll assess any new policies and plan accordingly. So we're going to control, again, what we can control in this environment. So I'll leave it at that Ken. Thank you. Sure. Let me start off with that. In terms of the guidance, we're guiding to a loss of $400 million to a loss of $200 million. So the challenge continues. But as I mentioned earlier, this 2025 will be similar based on all of our modeling to '24. There's some influx, yes, heifer retention, and we're not seeing meaningful heifer retention. But there's also the influx of heavier weight cattle. There's the influx of some dairy into the supply and a number of other things. I'll flip it to Brady to let him give you some of the finer details of that. Sure. Great question. And I won't hit on every specific location, but I will tell you how we start. We start with controlling the controllables in the business. And then we began, as many have talked today, about executing with excellence. We simply want to be best-in-class operations end-to-end. I don't care if it's chick or beef, pork prepared, international, or a function across Tyson Foods. So let's start with that. So when we look at the network, we consider a number of things. We consider the age of the asset. We consider the profitability of an asset. We consider the scale of an asset. We consider how competitive it is in the marketplace. Can it win? And we also then look at what future capital would be spent on that particular asset. And as we run all these things through a funnel, we make a long-term decision. And I must tell you, these are always challenging, painful decisions to make. But I think we have demonstrated the ability to look everywhere, to challenge ourselves to be the best, and then make decisions accordingly based on what we find. Operator Our next question comes from Thomas Palmer of Citi. Please go ahead. Thanks. Yes, great question, and thank you for that. I would remind you that in 2024, it was the best year we've had since 2018. I've said on calls, this call before, that there's upside to our prepared foods business. What we are doing, what we did in 2024, 2023, and we'll do in 2025 and beyond, is continue to drive out waste from our business. We'll continue to connect with that consumer and our customer with new and meaningful innovation. I've talked about what protein impact is and where it sits relative to inside the category of food, but we're literally pulling every lever within prepared foods. We're already seeing benefits of that. We saw it in 2024. We see that momentum continuing in 2025 and beyond. And a reminder, we're at midpoint. We are expecting a 10% growth from 2024 to 2025. Now let me introduce you to Kyle Narron, who now leads our prepared foods business. Thank you, Melanie, for outstanding 2024. And Kyle, give us a little more color relative to the question. So, Andrew, if I could, just maybe one additional comment, just to make sure the takeaway from the first question I answered this morning, we will continue to spend capital and return money to shareholders. But one of our focal points right now is to improve the return on the capital that we have already invested. And so, there's a lot of upside in that. And so, that's also a priority as you think about this in terms of the whole mix. Thanks for your continued interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon."

            "name": "Brady Stewart",
            "content": "Well, good morning, Heather. Appreciate the question. It's Brady. First of all, I think it's really important to point out just where we sit from a beef demand perspective, just kind of set the stage. And when we look at '24 versus '23, we saw it from a choice cutout perspective increase just relative to the wholesale price as well. And it was up a little more than 2%, which signals really good beef demand. And we've seen that in our business as well. Then when we go and we kind of dissect it by primal and by product, it gets a little bit more interesting as well. And so, really kind of flattish prices across the board on the rib and lion. But we've seen a significant increase in price on the grinds. And so, I'm not sure that every single one of the products on beef is really a clear substitute with chicken and with pork. But where we have seen that increased demand in price has really been on lean trim. It's been on the grind. And we've seen some substitution opportunities between the round complex and the lean complex as well. From a retailer perspective, we have seen several different strategies deployed. And because we've seen the steady demand for beef, we know that the consumer is going to stay in there, continue to buy beef. And so, some retailers have certainly taken that promotional opportunity to work on that rib and loin complex to drive those market baskets higher in general. So, I guess the overarching sentiment, just relative to beef, is really good demand, even with these higher prices, and expect that to continue into 2025. Sure. Thanks, Donnie. I think it's also important to understand what Tyson can control. I'm proud of the team relative to some of the improvements we made in '24. To have operating costs in our plants that are lower in '24 versus '23 when we saw some inflation and some lower headcount numbers is really meaningful to the outlook of our business as well and provides some visibility in terms of where we can control. This is one of the most dynamic beef environments in history, and we've gone through these cycles approximately every decade. But this one's really unique, and we've seen record cutout prices, some record weights that you referenced as well, and how all of these different pieces shape into the outlook is very interesting. So we've layered on a significant amount of data platforms to help us analyze our business better than we ever have before and make better business decisions that really drive outcomes that are important and meaningful And so from a cutout perspective, I mentioned earlier that we've seen really, really good demand, and we need to continue to understand that that good demand and really high cutout values provides greater importance now on our yields than it ever has in the history of the business as well. And so there's initiatives to continue to move forward and continually improve in that area as well. Grind is very, very important. I mentioned the record high prices we've seen on lean trim. How we convert lean trim into chubs or patties or their grind material to meet the consumer wherever they want to go is a good opportunity for us, and we've seen great initiatives and move in that area. Donnie mentioned the seasoned marinated progress, and we want to provide convenience to our customers as well and provide different platforms for them to purchase our beef products. Really proud of the team to continue to innovate and come up with different solutions for the future. And then just lastly, I just want to go back and reiterate the efficiency improvements that we have made year-over-year are absolutely meaningful as well and will help us navigate through whether we start to see additional heifer retention and potentially some lower harvest numbers, or it's more of a static demand case. Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew. Just relative to how we look at the business, 85% of the business really is somewhat uncontrollable relative to these market spreads. And so, that obviously provides some outsized weighting. But when you talk about the amount of resources that we deploy from a labor perspective, the amount of opportunity we have at $3 plus cutouts to continue to improve on yield, it's certainly meaningful on how we push forward and move forward in the business as well. And so, I'll just say that there's a great opportunity for us to continue to march forward towards world-class. We want to make sure that we minimize the losses in this challenging cycle. And we really have the right to win relative to the utilization of our six harvest assets as we move forward throughout the bottom side of this cycle."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Wes Morris",
            "content": "Yes, I'd love to. Ben, thank you for the question. And let me give you a little background so that it'll clear up a little bit. And I'd like to answer specifically your question around '25. And so, we executed our strategy in '24. It was a great team effort as we drove over a $0.5 billion in operational improvement across live plants and then matching up our supply and demand. And so, we delivered our strongest Q4 in history. But here's the part that most people don't know. While we were working on the cost side, we were also resetting the stage for the revenue side and winning with consumers. And so, Donnie mentioned our number one shared retail value added. We did a complete do-over in which we upgraded our quality to the point that our testing exceeded consumer expectations. Not I like it, but it exceeds my expectations. We've got a big innovation pipeline, both experimental and better for you. And experimental is form and flavor, what I call where food meets fun. And then the better for you is capitalizing on the protein content. We upgraded our packaging and it's based on basically decision trees of shopper's shop, brand, and then form and flavor. Donnie referenced our new advertising campaign. And what's exciting about that is that campaign resonates with our core shopper. Just as importantly, it resonates with the younger shopper, creating sustainability of demand over time. And so, we do have a stronger business and an impressive leadership team. We're well positioned into '25 and beyond to have a successful, sustainable business. And let me make one more comment about commercial, because that's something we've not talked about on the calls and a big step change going into '25. Our speed and improvement and go-to-market has been greatly increased. And so, business growth and R&D are a highly functioning team to not only understand them by consumer needs, but to create products and get them to commerce quickly. We've got the strongest pipeline of new products that I've seen in my career across any segment. And so, with that, let me transition to your question around 2025 outlook and how good is the number. And let me start with, hey, last year, my team surprised me with the speed and intensity of the improvement, right? So, yes, we did say 700, and we continued to perform faster and better than I anticipated. We think we've got good balance, good analytics, and good insight into what 2025 looks like. I'm very encouraged by 2025 as we've got a good team, we've got better fundamentals. Overarching markets appear stable. We've got a plan, performance improvement plan more than offsetting inflation. Then we'll spend around $100 million driving that mixed change of value added. And while our volume looks a little soft, last year, our fully cooked mix was up 5%. So, we've already started that mix adjustment to improve profitability. And so, all-in-all, we got a better cost structure, we got strong value added go-to-market hitting with a lot of intensity in 2025. And so, our guidance based on current market outlook, understanding we're more insulated than most companies, I feel good about. Now, we also think we're realistic about the macroeconomic impact of total demand, what's the industry supply potential, any impact to exports, ongoing weather patterns, which seem to be more frequent, and feed costs and global feedstocks. And so, we feel very good that based on what we know, our guidance is more accurate than any time in the past. Yes. I think in an effort to keep it fairly simple, if you use 2023 as a baseline, we have materially made a step change that has nothing to do with markets of over $500 million, right? We know where the continuous improvement opportunities are from there. So, I'm going to bake in another 185 that has nothing to do with markets. And so, we've made a major step change that regardless of meat values or corn values, those fundamental improvements are worth between $500 million and $700 million a year. Hi, Ms. Heather. This is Wes again. And I was so focused on the cost side of your question, I think I should have mentioned a big unlock on the revenue side as well as we go into 2025. So, as you know, we opened five fully cooked wines in our Danville, Virginia, new plant earlier in 2024. Through great efforts from both retail and food service, that plant is actually sold out. And so, that mixed change that I referenced earlier, also changing economics, is baked into our 2025 plan. And I'm excited to announce that we're already starting to work on the next five fully cooked wines. Yes. I'll share my perspective. If I could, I'll share my perspective real quick. We see the record exits, and I think it's reflecting strong demand for poultry, plus the industry's continued challenge in hatch and livability. Fortunately, Tyson's performance has dramatically outpaced the industry. We're able to service our customers. We referenced the 2.6% increase for the full year. But given the robust demand, I think there's good reason to believe that supply and demand are fairly balanced. But I want to be clear on something that we talk about internally. We really grow chickens for two reasons. We don't grow a lot of chickens to sell for whatever they're worth next Wednesday. We grow a lot of chickens for strategic customers to create win-win solutions who are looking for a continuity. And that has built-in mechanisms that if we perform, we make money. And then the second reason we grow chickens is as ingredients to our fully cooked and par-fry business, which we're growing exponentially. So the industry will do whatever it's going to do. I think we're well-positioned to win either way. Yes. I'd be glad to take that. And good morning, Michael. The industry's continued challenges on both hatch and livability. These increased egg sets and chicks placed physically aren't making it to the processing plants. And so, that makes a big difference. It's been a much tougher grow out environment between avian influenza, metapneumovirus. And so, I think you'll continue to see that disconnect as we go through 2025. The only offset being in higher bird weights, and that's actually driving the 2.6% increases through bird weight per head."

            "content": "Thanks, Donnie. Total company net sales were up 1.6% year-over-year in Q4 and 0.8% for fiscal '24. Beef and chicken were the primary drivers for the quarter, while beef and pork led the sales increase for the full year, partially offset by chicken. Q4 adjusted operating income of $512 million, margin of 3.8%, and adjusted EPS of $0.92 were the strongest quarterly results this year, all more than doubling versus Q4 of '23. And as Donnie mentioned, the best performance in the past eight quarters. Full-year AOI of more than $1.8 billion, nearly doubled, and adjusted EPS of $3.10 grew over 130%. Significant improvement in chicken profitability was the largest driver of year-over-year growth for both the quarter and the full year, with contributions from prepared foods and pork offsetting declines in beef. Now let's review our segment results for Q4. In prepared foods, Q4 revenue declined 1.2% versus last year, driven by lower retail volume. It's worth noting that we continued to make progress in total volume growth outside of retail in both Q4 and fiscal '24. As we expected, AOI in Q4 increased noticeably year-over-year, benefiting from lower raw material costs, operational efficiencies, and reduced MAP spending as we have focused on reducing inefficient support costs. These drivers also contributed to the best full-year AOI performance in the past six years, overcoming startup costs and unfavorable mix. Moving to chicken, sales in the quarter increased 2.3% inclusive of a legal contingency accrual recorded in Q4 last year. While volume declined modestly year-over-year, it grew approximately 1% versus Q4 of fiscal '22, as we continued to better align supply and demand. AOI increased $281 million versus last year to $356 million. Lower input costs, net of pass-through pricing, and improved operational efficiencies and execution drove the growth in AOI. For the year, chicken AOI improved by nearly $1.1 billion, leading to the strongest AOI performance since fiscal '17. In beef, revenue is up 4.6% year-over-year in the quarter, primarily due to volume, driven by higher average carcass weights and higher head throughput. While revenue increased, AOI decreased, primarily reflecting compressed spreads as expected. Moving to pork, Q4 revenue decreased 3.7%, driven by lower pricing on dropped credit items, partially offset by increased volume. AOI increased $27 million year-over-year, benefiting from improved operational execution. For the full year, AOI increased $270 million, highlighting improved spread. Shifting to our financial position, our commitment to disciplined capital allocation remains constant. Our priorities are to maintain financial strength, invest in the business, and return cash to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. Full-year cash flow from operations increased nearly $840 million, driven by improved profitability and working capital management. Operating cash flows of $2.6 billion was more than double our CapEx, which came in at just over $1.1 billion for the year, reflecting our disciplined capital deployment while continuing to invest for profitable growth. Fiscal '24 free cash flow improved by more than $1.6 billion year-over-year. This increase was driven by roughly equal contributions from higher operating cash flow and lower CapEx. Free cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion was more than 2x our total dividend. As you saw in our earnings release, we raised our dividend for the 13th consecutive year, reflecting confidence in our cash flow generation. We remain committed to the dividend as our primary way of returning cash to shareholders. Additionally, we ended the year with $4 billion of liquidity after repaying our 2024 senior notes in August for $1.25 billion. Net leverage declined again sequentially, ending the fiscal year at 2.6x. This is a full one and a half turns of improvement versus where we exited fiscal '23. We've made good progress, but continue to focus on returning net leverage to our long-term target of at or below 2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our plan for fiscal '24 was to apply our controlling the controllables approach to improve our financial strength. As you can see in our free cash flow and net leverage performance, we've clearly over-delivered on that plan and remain committed to deploying resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now let's look at our guidance for fiscal '25. We anticipate sales dollars to be flat to down 1%. We expect volume growth in chicken and prepared foods to be offset by lower beef and pork volumes. However, total company AOI is expected to be between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, reflecting approximately 10% growth at the midpoint driven by prepared foods and chicken. Rounding out key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $380 million and our tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. As Donnie mentioned, we're going to maintain tight controls on spending and CapEx to be between $1 billion and $1.2 billion this year. While there are a range of outcomes for AOI, we expect our free cash flow to exceed $700 million, which is approximately our new expected annual cash dividend. Moving to the breakdown of total company AOI by segment, starting with prepared foods. While we don't anticipate material changes in consumer behavior, we still see a pathway to significant growth in prepared foods AOI by focusing on operational improvements that are in our control, as you saw in our segment priorities for fiscal '25. We expect AOI to be in a range of $900 million to $1.1 billion, representing double-digit growth at the midpoint driven by these initiatives. In chicken, we plan to sustain and build on the operational improvements we put in place in fiscal '24. We are reinvesting a portion of these benefits into our value-added portfolio, highlighted by our master brand relaunch and new marketing campaign. We anticipate chicken AOI to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, highlighting high single-digit growth at the midpoint. Now on to our beef segment, where uncertainties remain, including the timing and pacing of meaningful herd rebuild intentions. These market dynamics are reflected in our range of outcomes for AOI for fiscal '25, where we expect a loss of $400 million to $200 million, which reflect a similar level of profitability year-over-year at the midpoint. In pork, we also expect a similar level of profitability in '25, as in '24, with AOI in the range of $100 million to $200 million. At the midpoint, benefits of our ongoing operational initiatives may be offset by tighter spreads. Our international business made strides in improving operations in fiscal '24, leading to a notable increase in AOI. We expect to make further progress in fiscal '25. Our outlook for the coming year reflects the benefit of our multi-protein, multi-channel portfolio. The middle of our range highlights solid earnings growth and continued progress on our operations and financial strength. Now I'll pass things back to Donnie to wrap up. And, Tom, this is Curt. I might add just on top of Kyle as well. Part of your question, I think, was around kind of the cadence that you might see it materialize. I think this would be a year where it might be a little more balanced across the year, different than kind of more of our historical norms, a little bit of seasonality, which is really what Kyle was speaking about relative to the operational efficiencies we continue to gain throughout the year. Thanks for the question. And I appreciate the comments. And we certainly did have a very disciplined approach from cash, cash deployment scenario in 2024, and drove net leverage down from 4.1x to 2.6x across the year. But we did still invest, $1.1 billion in CapEx. And at the guidance range that we've provided for next year, we would invest between $1 billion and $1.2 billion in CapEx in 2025. And we also had a comment in our guidance relative to free cash flow that would exceed our annual dividend, expected to be in the range of about $700 million. But we'll stay very constant relative to our capital allocation priorities around build financial strength, but also investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders, as you said. And obviously, make note, we did increase our dividend announced this morning, as well. And very proud of the accomplishments we've made, but we stay committed to our investment grade credit rating, and our long-term target leverage of at or below two times."

Compared to the third quarter of last year, AOI is up more than $300 million growing nearly 175% and adjusted EPS increased by more than $0.70 or almost 500%. Q3 not only dramatically improved versus last year but also marked the highest profitability in the last seven quarters. What's even more impressive is that we delivered these results despite well-known headwind in the cattle cycle as we benefited from our diverse portfolio. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our team members across every segment and function for their hard work in contributing to these results, in Q3 and for their dedication to driving operational excellence which as you know has been a priority for us. Let me highlight the performance in chicken. We delivered segment AOI of more than $300 million, the best third quarter profit result in eight years. We are raising our guidance in chicken for the third consecutive quarter. The midpoint of our outlook is now $350 million better than our initial expectations coming into the fiscal year. I want to emphasize that the operational improvements we've been driving are enabling us to benefit from the market tailwinds, invest in our value-added portfolio, but also enhancing our results. In fact, all of our businesses are more agile, collaborative, and disciplined than they have been in some time. Beyond the strong results in chicken in Q3, pork also came in better than we anticipated, while beef and prepared foods were in line with our expectations. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to improve cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow is better by more than $1.2 billion compared to last year. This growth was driven by improved profitability and our focus on managing working capital and controlling capital expenditures. While still investing for profitable growth, and again, we're delivering these results in the face of a challenging environment for beef. Better performance has helped us to reduce our net leverage ratio for the third consecutive quarter. Before I talk more about the performance in the quarter by segment, let me remind you that we have some of the most iconic retail brands in all of food with top brands in protein. Behind Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park, we have the number one or number two market share in eight of our core business lines and enjoy favorite brand status in key categories. I remain highly confident in our strategy and optimistic about our future and the ability to drive long-term value for shareholders. Let's move to segment performance starting with Prepared Foods. In Food Service, we continue to broaden our customer base, grow in margin accretive channels, and expand our presence in broad line distribution categories. This led to overall volume and sales growth in Q3. AOI for the quarter was right in line with our expectations. Operational execution including supply chain improvements and more efficient and effective marketing support through digital are delivering results. In addition, we are leaning into our top performing skews to capture opportunities to expand distribution. While our brands remain strong, we are continually focused on new innovations to expand the appeal and market opportunities for our products. For instance, the Jimmy Dean Griddle Cakes platform is an innovation we are very proud of. We've launched two flavors, maple and blueberry, and we're seeing an exceptionally strong repeat rate and customer adoption making it one of the most successful Prepared Foods innovation over the past five years. Our focus on execution and innovation are keeping us on track to deliver another solid performance for the year. As I mentioned, chicken had one of its best quarters in some time, but we are clearly benefiting from better market conditions including lower grain costs, our actions and focus on the fundamentals across all aspects of the value chain are also contributing to these strong results. Our live operations continue to improve with hatch rate and livability up year-over-year. We generate efficiencies and improve utilization in our plants by optimizing our network. Our demand planning and customer service have also taken significant steps forward as we improve order bill rates and continued to build long-term partnerships with customers all the while reducing inventory. We've reinvested some of the proceeds from these improvements into the long-term growth of our value added chicken business. For instance, we've accelerated the ramp up of our Danville Fully Cooked facility and launched new products like honey bites and restaurant quality wings. In summary, our focus on the basics has built a fundamentally stronger chicken business with an eye on the future. Moving to beef, as expected, elevated cattle costs continue to compress spreads in fiscal Q3. While pasture conditions have improved this year, clear size of meaningful herd rebuilding have not emerged. We continue to be laser-focused on the things we can control, such as labor utilization, yield, and mixed management to meet consumer demand and customer needs as we manage through the challenges of the cattle cycle. Turning to pork, the overall health of the herd and the productivity of styles remain strong, driving an ample supply of lean hog, combined with solid demand and the benefits of our improved operational execution. AOI increased noticeably versus last year. Now let me take a moment to reflect on who we are. Our purpose is to feed the world like family, where protein remains clearly at the center of the plate. In fact, protein is the largest category in the retail food and beverage sector, accounting for about one third of sales in the U.S. We believe protein plays a central role in any healthy diet. This is why we see consumption growth is up 1.3% across feed, chicken, and pork in fiscal Q3 per Nielsen [ph]. And is also why we have protein as a foundational core. Our strategy encompasses our differentiated capabilities and scale and our diverse portfolio across channels, categories, and eating occasion. Our strategic pillars are supported by key enablers of operational excellence, customer and consumer obsession, along with data and digital. One key goal is building on our iconic brands to value up our core proteins. Today, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, and Hillshire Farm are three of the top 10 protein brands with room to expand household penetration. Brands are our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margin, and stronger returns, and is the most effective way to generate long-term shareholder value. As I've emphasized all year, our priorities are centered on controlling the controllables, including cash management. Our cash flow performance this year demonstrates the success we've had on this front. We're also focused on operational excellence by continuously improving chicken, strengthening Prepared Foods, navigating beef through a difficult cattle cycle, and driving efficiencies in pork. We came into fiscal 2024 with plans to deliver against these priorities. Our focus on being intentional and deliberate on executing those plans is delivering tangible results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt to review our financial performance in more detail.\nCurt Calaway: Thanks, Donnie. Total company net sales of 13.35 billion in Q3 were up 1.6% year-over-year. The increase was led by beef with contributions from pork and Prepared Foods partially offset by declines in chicken and international. Adjusted operating income improved $312 million to nearly $500 million, driven primarily by another quarter of substantial increase in chicken profitability. Operational improvements and substantially higher AOI led to a $0.72 increase in adjusted EPS, which came in at $0.87 in Q3. As Donnie mentioned earlier, this is our best AOI, AOI margin, and adjusted EPS in the past seven quarters. Now let's review our segment results starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q3 revenue grew 2.1% versus last year driven by volume growth in Food Service. As we expected, AOI in Q3 was down modestly, higher raw material costs were partially offset by lower map spend versus an elevated level last year, and the benefits of operational efficiencies and top-line growth. Moving to chicken, sales in Q3 declined 3.2%, primarily due to the pass-through of lower input costs and pricing. While volume is roughly flat year-over-year, as we continue to better align supply with customer demand, it was up approximately 2% from Q3 of fiscal 2022. AOI increased $370 million versus last year to $307 million. Lower input costs, net-of-pass-through pricing, along with the benefits of the strategic actions we have taken and the efficiencies the business has driven across our operations, drove the growth in AOI. We also experienced favorable year-over-year derivative impact of $63 million, primarily related to a $65 million net derivative loss in Q3 last year. In beef, revenue was up 5.8% year-over-year in the quarter primarily due to the volume impact of higher average carcass weights, with pricing increasing 1.4%. While revenue increased, AOI decreased primarily reflecting compressed spreads as expected, which more than offset our continued progress on operational efficiencies. Moving to pork, Q3 revenue increased a net 10.4% driven by higher price per pound reflecting healthy global demand. AOI also increased $92 million year-over-year benefiting from improved spreads and better operational execution. Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Our commitment to disciplined capital allocation remains unchanged. Our priorities are to maintain financial strength, invest in the business, and return cash to shareholders all while maintaining our investment grade credit rating. Cash flow from operations remains strong, with year-to-date approaching $2 billion, highlighting improved profitability and working capital management. Operating cash flows was more than double our CAPEX, which came in at $884 million year-to-date. CAPEX in Q3 of $263 million declined sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter, reflecting our focus on controlling capital deployment while continuing to invest for profitable growth. Year-to-date free cash flow of $1.1 billion is more than two and a half times better than the previous two fiscal years combined over the same period. We ended Q3 with $4.8 billion of liquidity. Improving profits and strong cash management are also benefiting our net leverage, which declined sequentially again, coming in at three times in Q3, more than a full-turn lower than where we exited fiscal 2023. We continue focusing on returning net leverage to our long-term target of at or below two times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We entered fiscal 2024 with a plan of applying our controlling the controllables approach to enhance free cash flow generation. We've over-delivered on that plan and remain committed to deploying resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now let's look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. We are reiterating our overall sales guidance at roughly flat year-over-year. Based primarily on our improved outlook for chicken, we are raising our AOI guidance and tightening the range. For the total company we now expect between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. Moving to the segments, in chicken, given the strong performance we're raising our AOI guidance range to be between $850 million and $950 million. For Prepared Foods, we are reiterating our AOI outlook of $850 million to $950 million as we continue to perform in line with expectations. In beef, we are tightening our AOI guidance range to a loss between $400 million and $300 million, reflecting well-known challenges in the cattle cycle. In pork, we are raising our AOI outlook to be between $100 million and $200 million highlighting improved year-to-date results versus expectations. To round out the key P&L items, we continue to anticipate interest expense to be roughly $395 million and our tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. Turning to CAPEX, we are maintaining our tight controls on spending in line with profitability and cash flows, and are narrowing our CAPEX range to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion this year. Before I turn the call back over to Donnie, I want to emphasize that our multi-protein, multi-channel strategy is enabling us to raise the midpoint of our full year AOI guidance by $100 million. Now, I'll hand it over to Donnie to wrap up before we move to Q&A.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Curt. Before we get to your questions, I want to express my deep gratitude to our incredible team members. Your dedication and hard work are the driving forces behind our mission to feed the world-like family and bring high-quality food to every table in the world. Together, we have achieved a remarkable turnaround and our momentum continues. Finally, I am grateful to our customers and consumers for their trust, loyalty, and partnership. I couldn't be more excited for the opportunities ahead of us and remain confident that our strategy will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder value. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\nSean Cornett: Thanks, Donnie. We will now move to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Goldman: Hi, good morning, and thank you. I wanted to ask, I appreciate a lot of the information you gave about each segment, thank you for that. Donnie, as you think about taking a step back, looking at kind of the underlying fundamentals, especially in your two biggest segments, chicken and beef, but across the company, kind of what were the more important puts and takes in the quarter versus your expectations, just in terms of how fundamentals came in against what you were initially anticipating?\nDonnie King: Good morning Ken and thank you for the question. Let me start with we are pleased with our Q3 results which is the best quarter in the last seven. We are seeing the benefits of our multi-protein portfolio where chicken, prepared and pork are offsetting the headwinds in beef. In Q3 momentum continues to strengthen, and all of our businesses are executing better than they have in quite some time. We're executing against the priorities we laid out for fiscal year 2024. In short, we are controlling the controllables, we are optimizing our network, and we remain focused on operational excellence. We have taken decisive action to drive performance and to build financial strength. Our performance has given us confidence to raise our guidance again. Now let me step into the segments, and I'll start with chicken. Our focus on the fundamentals behind the number one brand is delivering results. Chicken had a strong Q3. We had the best adjusted operating income since fiscal year 2016, it was eight years ago. Best capacity utilization since Q4 of 2018, six years ago. The best livability since fiscal year 2020. Supply chain and S&OP processes is allowing us to improve order fill rate while simultaneously lowering our inventory and working capital. In beef, we're managing through volatility and spread tightening. We continue to focus on operational excellence. In pork, better spreads and ongoing operational execution led to better profitability. In Prepared Foods, our results were in line with our expectations, our brands are strong, and our share remains healthy.\nKenneth Goldman: Okay, thank you for that Donnie. And then I had a quick follow-up. As a company, you have a unique view into how restaurants are performing, particularly quick service. And I'm just wondering, we've heard from some quick service restaurants lately that they're not necessarily seeing real improvements in traffic yet, but maybe there are some green shoots, just as we -- as they experience some of the initial early benefits as the companies lean harder into promotions and actions that appeal to maybe some lower income consumers. So I'm just curious what you're seeing from your perspective from the restaurant industry in general, how it affects you, and if there's any real changes to your outlook in QSRs in particular? Thank you.\nDonnie King: So, thanks Ken. Just as a reminder, in the protein space, there typically are lower levels of elasticity. And protein is a consumer staple. And I'd also remind you, Ken, and then I'll pass this over to Melanie to add a little more color on Food Service. But in retail, we hold leadership positions in 8 of 10 categories, and three of the top 10 brands in protein. So with that, Melanie, why don't you speak a little bit to...\nMelanie Boulden: Thank you, Donnie. Happy to do so. And Ken, I'm going to talk to you with my enterprise CGO hat on. So first of all, the Food Service industry, as you know, is large. And demand for protein is strong as consumers see protein as an essential staple in their diets and meal routines. And at Tyson Foods we are advantaged because Tyson's diverse food servers portfolio spans major proteins, chicken, beef and pork. And this year, we've also seen a particular interest in our poultry offerings as quick-serve restaurants have been emphasizing value menu offerings. These factors, combined with our large and flexible manufacturing infrastructure, have been instrumental in driving our performance. For example, our ability to quickly partner with customers on LTOs or limited time offerings to meet their business objectives, we're operating is best-in-class. At the same time, that flexibility is also helping us to better partner with our customers to quickly develop innovation. Now our commercial scale is also a strategic advantage. On any given day, you'll find our products in school lunch programs, quick-serve restaurants, fine dining establishments, and hospitals. You'll also find us in travel and entertainment venues such as airports, cruise ships, movie theaters, amusement parks, and concert venues. This allows us to meet consumers where they are. Look, we remain focused on what we can control in Food Service, including improving our product pipeline with innovation to drive operator value and new customer acquisition. We're also focused on leveraging the diversity and flexibility of our broad manufacturing base to better serve our partners. And finally, we're focused on shifting the mix to advantaged channels. So because of these actions, we're building momentum going into fiscal year 2025 and are positioned well for continued growth.\nOperator: Next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone. I was hoping to dig into the results in chicken a bit more and really parse some of the drivers of operating margin improvement between the lower grain costs, which I believe at least on a gross basis in the Q were quantified at $305 million versus some of the underlying cost and mix actions that you've been undertaking and how should we think about that progressing, there's obviously implication in the guidance for 4Q, but help us think about what's embedded in the fourth quarter guidance from a net grain cost tailwind would be helpful? Thank you.\nDonnie King: So Ken, thank you for the question. Let me start by saying, I'm going to take this opportunity to pass this question over to our Chief Architect in Poultry, Wes Morris. He's been the person responsible. He and his team for the chicken turnaround that we have seen. So Wes?\nWes Morris: Yeah, thanks Donnie. Overall, I'd say I'm very pleased with the improvement in our cost fundamentals, and we're well poised for growth. Nothing's really changed. The big three areas that we've talked about the last few quarters around our live plant and S&OP. Our live results continued to improve. Our hatch was up 360 basis points versus a year ago, just short of 83. Our livability improved 50 points to 93.71 [ph] in a pretty tough grow-out environment. And then our cost 500 on the in bench mail [ph] and then a very deliberate focus on our live fundamentals are paying big dividends. The network changes that are paying off. Capacity utilization, as Donnie said, continues to improve sequentially and we still have room to grow. And then our S&OP process continues to add value. Service was up 100 basis points on an order field, while reducing our working capital around $260 million. We have a really highly functioning demand planning and supply planning team and our total poultry group is engaged in that area. Now we invested some of that operational improvements back into the business. As you know, we have the number one share in retail and Food Service, and we're focused on investing there. So our Danville fully cooked plant is well started up, that location is about a year ahead of schedule from what we originally anticipated. We've got a strong innovation pipeline. We've invested in quality and consumer promotions. And so I think our range is good. We've raised our guidance 850 to 950. Historically, Q1 and Q3 is our best quarters with Q2 and Q4 being a little softer and then the ongoing investments. So I feel well balanced at the midpoint.\nAdam Samuelson: Okay, that's helpful. And then if I could just ask a follow-up on beef. Donnie, you alluded to in the prepared remarks, no obvious signs of herd rebuilding. Just as we think about the implication of that over the next couple of years with just fewer cattle\u2019s that are still going to not coming to market. How do we think about your own capacity utilization and industry capacity utilization in the sector and kind of if you reach a breaking point there that we might have to see some capacity rationalization?\nBrady Stewart: Well, thanks Adam for the question. And I'll just start with saying this, it's going to be very challenging to continue to really forecast the outcomes relative to this beef cycle. Every beef cycle has some differences embedded within it. And one of the key indicators relative to the cycle is droughts and monitoring drought in specific areas. So as you alluded to, we haven't seen really any notable retention to date. We've seen some differences relative to specific regions. And I would say that correlates really well relative to what those specific regions have from a climate and drought perspective. So when you definitely really evaluate as we move forward, what we do know is we're not expecting any incremental supply here in the short-term, which is consistent with these beef cycles. However, we're really focused on what we can control. And the highlights for our beef team have been decreased costs year-over-year relative to our manufacturing and our efficiencies have improved in our assets. We continue to see improvements in our yields, in our plants. We're doing a better job of balancing our supply and demand of cattle to beef and what our consumers and customers are demanding as well. So when you parlay all of those things together, we'll continue to manage what we can control and focus on really indications in the future on this rebuild.\nDonnie King: So if I could add one thing to that. Thank you, Brady. Our asset base is we're well invested, and we are capable of running with the very best in the industry. I'll remind you, Adam and others that the benefits of our multi-protein portfolio, which is driving our momentum with the strength in chicken and prepared foods and pork, and we see that offsetting challenges in beef. We see that continuing for the balance of the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question on the chicken business, you're certainly seeing very strong improvements. But my question is about opportunities for -- yes, further improvement from here. And where I'm coming from is the margins were in the lower end of what typically is your normal range despite those internal improvements, the seasonality benefits in the quarter, the strong external environment. So can you maybe reflect on where the business is versus where it needs to be longer term and the path to more sustainably getting into that kind of normal chicken margin range?\nWes Morris: Yeah, this is Wes. I would say that we continue to focus on the fundamentals. We got a little different business mix and business volatility than some of the commodity players as we don't sell a lot of outside raw materials where price is immediate. We've got several pricing models. Some are grain-based and so as grain has come off, we pass that on to the customers, and that's fair. And then we have a high percentage of packaged goods and so we're going to stay focused on stabilization of earnings over time, strong relationships with key customers, and sustainable value creation. So regardless of what markets are doing, I expect us to deliver best-in-class results over time and stay focused on the controllables.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay, that's helpful. And then on beef, I guess the guidance implies for the fourth quarter, bigger losses. And so I guess just directionally, and I appreciate your comments on the difficulties with forecasting this part of the beef cycle here. I guess, is there any way that you want us to think about directionally 2025 versus 2024, or what the implications are for the fourth quarter into next year and then when you talk about controlling the controllables in beef, what are some of those key controllables that you're most focused on or the levers that you can pull from here? Thank you.\nDonnie King: Sure. Andrew, let me just say this. In terms of 2025 outlook, it's a little bit early for us. We'll be happy to discuss at length in Q4. So look forward to that. Just a reminder, there is no -- data doesn't support herd rebuild at this point but -- on a positive note, pasture conditions and feed costs are supportive of a herd rebuild. Interest rates, for example, might be a headwind, but there's no clear sign of herd retention. Brady, why don't you go deeper into that?\nBrady Stewart: Sure. And thanks for the question, Andrew. And specifically on our beef performance, we are completely dialed in to making sure that we have cost-effective operations. And so everything from our harvest efficiencies and our assets to our yields to making sure that we are dialed in with our customers and consumers and balancing that to the type and kind of cattle that we're procuring and making sure that we understand those value equations, is where we've seen improvements in our operations. And the real call out for us, again, is the significant year-over-year decrease in our manufacturing cost and our assets. We're running a much better operation today than we were a year ago, and we're certainly proud of that and thank the team for their continued improvements in these areas.\nOperator: The next question comes from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Please go ahead.\nHeather Jones: Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. I want to start with chicken and specifically the strong improvements you all made there. And Wes, I think you said hatch was up 360 bps year-on-year, it's nearly 83%, which is far better than the industry is doing. So just wondering if you could help us understand how much of that is sustainable improvements in the breed or in husbandry versus, I would assume there's been some early liquidation of some flocks related to plant closures, and so I'm just trying to figure out how to model that going forward?\nWes Morris: Yes, sure, Heather. Thank you for the question. We see the USDA data and no question the industry exits and wages are well up, but the bird simply aren't making it to the plant. And so our genetics and strategic focus are just the opposite. I did say our hatch is up 360 basis points. I do believe it is sustainable. I think we've got the right programs in place. We're seeing intense focus on the execution. Our grower partners are buying into the performance and our livability is up 50 points even in a tough grow-out environment. So we're obviously outperforming in live. And yes, I believe that to be not only sustainable when we hit the fall cooler weather, I expect it to improve.\nHeather Jones: Okay, thank you for that. And then my follow-up is on beef, and I just -- I hate to beat a dead horse, but just there's some big differences between the last cycle. So the rebuild has been very slow in coming and it's likely to be more extended. You've got plants being added this time. Your imports are far larger than they were last time. So I am just wondering if you have a sense of how long you think this downturn could last and if Tyson needs to maybe permanently reduce days of slaughter at certain plants or just how you are all planning on tackling that?\nBrady Stewart: Thanks for that question Heather. And again, I just go back to that drought monitor, the USDA and NOAA published and produced. And so through the last cycle, obviously, we saw a drought in that 2012, 2013 and then a relatively good rebound in 2014, 2015 and 2016. And then really, from a drought perspective in beef cow country, really, really low persistence relative to drought in the 2019 that led into some really good numbers here within the last three to five years. And so we'll continue to evaluate and understand and focus on that. That's really a prerequisite to this rebuild. Donnie outlined some of the other factors that are in play relative to the rebuild as well. But just to reiterate what Donnie said as well, we've made really good investments in our beef operations, and we like our asset base. We like our team. We like the supply partnerships we have, both on the cattle supply and the partnerships we have with our customers as well and really have laid out a variety of range of outcomes and understanding where the cycle really go and win most importantly, and we'll continue to evaluate that as we move forward.\nDonnie King: And if I could, I would add this to Brady's comments, once again, Heather, the benefits of our multi-protein portfolio the momentum and the strength which we have there where chicken, prepared foods, pork and even our international business offsetting those -- this cattle cycle that we're in. So we've been able to do that, did that well in Q3, and I would expect that for the balance of the year, and we think we will have a good overall fiscal 2025. It's too early to talk about that in great detail, but we're very optimistic about 2025.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you, good morning. Just wanted to come back to Prepared Foods. You said the volume growth was driven by Food Service, but overall price was pretty flat. I'm just trying to get a sense of the promotional environment. And maybe if you could give us a little split between Food Service and retail, how they looked and just what sort of price expectations you have going forward, are you seeing -- we're hearing from a lot of companies that consumers are kind of balking at some of the prices, are you having to promote a little bit more, can you just give us kind of a finger on the pulse of where the consumer is these days?\nMelanie Boulden: Yes. So thanks, Michael. Let me give you first an overview of our Q3 performance, and then I'll dive a little bit deeper into kind of the promotional environment that we're seeing. So overall, our Prepared Foods third quarter performance, as you know, was in line with our expectations, and we're pleased with the results as we delivered both volume and sales growth. But as you know, we made a number of investments in our plans to add new capacity and capabilities. That's important to remember, as our profit was roughly flat to year ago when you adjust for the incremental expenses associated with the ramp-up of those additions. Also important to note is that our results were accomplished despite lapping a period of higher merchandising levels and lower input costs. And there's really three key factors that drove our performance in the quarter: First, our operational excellence has improved dramatically. We've had tremendous commercial success. And then as you noted, our Food Service volume growth was strong. Now as I think about our promotional environment, please know that our teams closely monitor in market pricing dynamics, elasticities, and promotional performance at a granular level. We have a disciplined approach to pricing and promotions, and we make changes to our strategy as the consumer landscape evolves. Now this doesn't mean that we're just reactive. The strength of our brands, our customer relationships, our data-driven consumer insights, and our leadership position across multiple categories affords us the opportunity to act fast when the marketplace changes. And now pricing and promotion, there are a couple of the key levers, but we're also focused on ensuring that our items are in the right package and in the right channel to meet consumers' needs. I would say it's also important to remember what Donnie highlighted that protein, which consumers see as an essential staple, enjoy lower elasticities than other food categories. Therefore, we believe consumers will continue to prioritize protein. I'd point to all these factors as the reason that Tyson's retail volume grew in the quarter.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Theurer: Yeah, good morning. Donnie and Curt. Thanks for taking the questions. So I just wanted to dig a little bit into like the cadence 3Q into 4Q because if I remember right, roughly three months ago, you've talked about potential downside risk in the third fiscal quarter, atypical seasonality, it seems like that did turn out. So maybe can you help us understand what was different in the quarter versus what you initially expected to come out to that close to $500 million in operating income and how that then relates into, call it, maybe the higher end versus lower end of that remaining guidance for 4Q, that would be my first question? Thank you.\nCurt Calaway: Yeah, thanks. This is Curt. I'll kick it over to Wes in just a minute. But principally speaking, right, we talked about the back half of the year and a little bit of seasonality challenges that we perhaps could have. But to be specific on your question before I turn it over to Wes, it was really some stronger chicken performance than we had anticipated when we talked three months ago. But overall, kind of the construct that we thought about the back half of the year relatively in line. But certainly, as we said earlier, increased the overall midpoint of our guidance by $100 million, really with the strength of Q3 and I'll turn it over to Wes to talk a little bit about chicken\u2019s performance.\nWes Morris: Yes. I'll take a big part of that change and it's pretty simple. Our poultry team is improving faster than I expected or that we modeled in a lot of different areas. Like live for instance, that we just talked about or our supply demand planning group. And so we haven't called a different play. We've just executed it faster than I expected.\nBenjamin Theurer: Okay. And then my follow-up, I know it tends to not get that much of attention, but it feels like it's coming together a little bit better on the international side. Could you share some of the initiatives you're currently doing and how that international business, how you think about this in the medium term because I know, Donnie, you always talk about the growth -- demand growth is in the international market, so just to understand how you think of investing and positioning yourself to even further accelerate the growth in the international segment?\nDonnie King: Sure. Our international business does continue to grow. And if you'll recall, over the last couple of years, we've invested heavily behind a number of assets in China and Southeast Asia. I would tell you, in those marketplaces, there are a number of macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. We have seen a little better improvement in raw materials. But to go any deeper into that, let me introduce Devin Cole, who is new to this call, but not new to Tyson and he's just returned to our company in March. He's been the Head of our Global McDonald's business. And now we've added the International business on to him. And so with that, Devin, welcome, and please go ahead.\nDevin Cole: Thank you, Donnie. Of course, it's pretty early in the process of evaluating this business from my standpoint. But I would tell you, I'm encouraged by the quality of our team, assets that I've had the chance to see around the world. We're really focused on some very key metrics, and that's just to keep our team members safe, make sure we've got the best food safety, the best product quality innovation for all of our customers around the world and also focused highly on operational excellence as we bring these new facilities up to speed. And I am convinced that we have the assets and the team to deliver the portfolio of products to meet both customer and consumer needs around the world. And really what this will allow us to do is to provide the growth in results that we expect and that we need to drive the operational efficiencies and capacity utilization in these assets.\nDonnie King: So if I may just add one other thing to that, Devin and thank you. As many of you will recall, Amy, too, was the leader of our International business. Since we were together last, Amy has decided to retire. And I know she is probably listening today, and I just want to say that we miss her and thank her for many contributions to the company. We wish Amy and her husband Christian well. But we have Devin in the seat now and look forward to many exceptional things as it relates to International.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Donnie and Wes, maybe just a quick one on chicken because I know we've spent quite a bit of time on it on the call. Just help us parse out maybe as we think about sustainability of chicken profitability in 2025. How much in the quarter kind of you attribute to market factors relative kind of to the underlying and not looking for specific numbers, but if it's percentages or however you kind of think about what drove the Q3 over delivery, again, as we try and project that forward into 4Q and 2025?\nWes Morris: Yeah, thanks for the question Peter. As I've said, we had solid improvement in our fundamentals, and we partially offset those by investments. If I had to call the year today, I'd call it 40% performance base, 60% market-based. But if I adjust for the investments, I'd call it around 50-50. But it's important that my team stay focused on sustainable performance and driving value over time regardless of what those market conditions are.\nPeter Galbo: Great, no, that's very helpful. Thanks Wes. Curt, maybe, welcome to the call, nice to hear you on the call. I think there's a pretty big bond maturity coming due in the fourth quarter. So maybe you can just talk a bit about how you're thinking about approaching that, I saw the lowered interest expense guidance, but how we should think about that particularly large debt maturity? Thanks very much.\nCurt Calaway: Thanks Peter. Yes, you're right. Maybe the best way to handle that is think about our liquidity. And we finished the quarter, right, with about $4.8 billion of liquidity. And that was partially driven by a bond offering that we did earlier this year to effectively prefund that, if you will. So yes, the bond maturity is coming up here in August of $1.25 billion, and we'll look to pay that off this month.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning everyone. So a couple of quick ones. Can you -- talking about chicken again, what are the key risks from here, is it as simple as if grain prices go up again, that could put pressure on the business, I'm just wondering where the growth from here comes or whether we're kind of approaching peak at this point? And then I have a follow-up.\nWes Morris: So again, Alexia, thank you for the question. We're laser focused on the fundamentals of our business. Certainly, grains have an impact. Our commercial relationships, we continue to work with some key customers to help stabilize earnings and create win-win solutions with those key customers. So it's -- for me, it's about staying focused on what we do and getting better at it every day.\nDonnie King: So if I could add one thing to that Wes has mentioned two or three times, but just to make sure it's clear, that from a mix perspective, Wes and his team are continuing to value up the mix from, let's call it, more commodity-oriented products to more value-added branded across Retail and Food Service.\nAlexia Howard: Great, thank you very much. And can I just pick up on one word that you used early in the prepared remarks. You talked about collaboration across the businesses improving or being as good as you've seen it. Can you be more specific about what has improved on the collaboration side and how that's manifesting itself in the organization? Thank you and I will pass it on.\nDonnie King: Sure. If I look at the team that's sitting around the table here this morning, we have some of the best people in the industry, in their specific discipline. They have a great deal of experience, and they are very passionate and competitive in everything they do. But the mantra that we have here at Tyson is one team, one Tyson, all behind our mission, feeding the world like family. And at the same time, making sure that there's high-quality protein on every table in the world. But the collaboration component of that is a team coming together and really being united around this one Tyson approach.\nOperator: The next question comes from Thomas Palmer with Citi. Please go ahead.\nThomas Palmer: Good morning and thanks for the question. Maybe start out on the prepared foods side. The midpoint of guidance implies profit in 4Q, might not have as big of a seasonal pullback relative to 3Q as it might in a typical year. I know you mentioned this possibility a quarter ago. Could you just give us a reminder as to why this seasonality might not be as pronounced as normal? Thanks.\nCurt Calaway: Tom, this is Curt. I'll add a couple of things and then let Melanie add to it. But we are hopefully very clear last quarter where we talked about midpoint of the guidance of $900 million and implying obviously $400 million in the back half, and it would be split relatively even. I'll add to that, right. We -- while we've tightened the guidance range throughout the year, our midpoint has been consistent across the whole year. And specifically as well, our thoughts around Q4 and the profit outlook also were very unchanged and consistent as we've thought about it. But I'll let Melanie add a couple of elements from her perspective.\nMelanie Boulden: Yeah, so thanks for the question. And as I think about the future seasonality and Q4, we expect to have a strong Q4 compared to prior years. First, the cost associated with the new capacity and capabilities I touched on earlier, will be significantly reduced as those assets ramp up. This is true both sequentially and versus year ago. Second, the operational excellence initiatives we're driving are accretive. And -- or additive, I should say, meaning the total dollar impact will grow each quarter as we reduce cost and drive out inefficiencies. We also expect to continue strong commercial performance behind our Food Service business. And then finally, I'd also point to our growth in bacon, which is enabled by the successful start-up of our Bowling Green Facility and because of the new capacity and capabilities that we brought online, we're growing and gaining share in bacon. So as I think about Q4 as well as the momentum going into 2025, we're confident in our path forward. And a lot of this is obviously driven by our team that has been working really, really hard and is focused on delivering our goals.\nThomas Palmer: Thanks for that. And then just on an income statement item, SG&A has been trending sequentially lower throughout the year. What's driving this and is there a segment where we would see these reductions being most apparent?\nCurt Callaway: Just a couple of comments from me. I think we've had a fairly disciplined approach over this last year relative to our SG&A management. It will feel a little lumpy in a couple of quarters because we've got some higher performance-based compensation impacting each of the quarters. But overall, a very disciplined focus on our cost control spending this year.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.\nDonnie King: Thank you for your continued interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Donnie. Happy to do so. And Ken, I'm going to talk to you with my enterprise CGO hat on. So first of all, the Food Service industry, as you know, is large. And demand for protein is strong as consumers see protein as an essential staple in their diets and meal routines. And at Tyson Foods we are advantaged because Tyson's diverse food servers portfolio spans major proteins, chicken, beef and pork. And this year, we've also seen a particular interest in our poultry offerings as quick-serve restaurants have been emphasizing value menu offerings. These factors, combined with our large and flexible manufacturing infrastructure, have been instrumental in driving our performance. For example, our ability to quickly partner with customers on LTOs or limited time offerings to meet their business objectives, we're operating is best-in-class. At the same time, that flexibility is also helping us to better partner with our customers to quickly develop innovation. Now our commercial scale is also a strategic advantage. On any given day, you'll find our products in school lunch programs, quick-serve restaurants, fine dining establishments, and hospitals. You'll also find us in travel and entertainment venues such as airports, cruise ships, movie theaters, amusement parks, and concert venues. This allows us to meet consumers where they are. Look, we remain focused on what we can control in Food Service, including improving our product pipeline with innovation to drive operator value and new customer acquisition. We're also focused on leveraging the diversity and flexibility of our broad manufacturing base to better serve our partners. And finally, we're focused on shifting the mix to advantaged channels. So because of these actions, we're building momentum going into fiscal year 2025 and are positioned well for continued growth. Yes. So thanks, Michael. Let me give you first an overview of our Q3 performance, and then I'll dive a little bit deeper into kind of the promotional environment that we're seeing.

            "content": "Thanks Sean and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Q3 was another solid quarter as momentum continues to build. Compared to the third quarter of last year, AOI is up more than $300 million growing nearly 175% and adjusted EPS increased by more than $0.70 or almost 500%. Q3 not only dramatically improved versus last year but also marked the highest profitability in the last seven quarters. What's even more impressive is that we delivered these results despite well-known headwind in the cattle cycle as we benefited from our diverse portfolio. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our team members across every segment and function for their hard work in contributing to these results, in Q3 and for their dedication to driving operational excellence which as you know has been a priority for us. Let me highlight the performance in chicken. We delivered segment AOI of more than $300 million, the best third quarter profit result in eight years. We are raising our guidance in chicken for the third consecutive quarter. The midpoint of our outlook is now $350 million better than our initial expectations coming into the fiscal year. I want to emphasize that the operational improvements we've been driving are enabling us to benefit from the market tailwinds, invest in our value-added portfolio, but also enhancing our results. In fact, all of our businesses are more agile, collaborative, and disciplined than they have been in some time. Beyond the strong results in chicken in Q3, pork also came in better than we anticipated, while beef and prepared foods were in line with our expectations. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to improve cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow is better by more than $1.2 billion compared to last year. This growth was driven by improved profitability and our focus on managing working capital and controlling capital expenditures. While still investing for profitable growth, and again, we're delivering these results in the face of a challenging environment for beef. Better performance has helped us to reduce our net leverage ratio for the third consecutive quarter. Before I talk more about the performance in the quarter by segment, let me remind you that we have some of the most iconic retail brands in all of food with top brands in protein. Behind Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park, we have the number one or number two market share in eight of our core business lines and enjoy favorite brand status in key categories. I remain highly confident in our strategy and optimistic about our future and the ability to drive long-term value for shareholders. Let's move to segment performance starting with Prepared Foods. In Food Service, we continue to broaden our customer base, grow in margin accretive channels, and expand our presence in broad line distribution categories. This led to overall volume and sales growth in Q3. AOI for the quarter was right in line with our expectations. Operational execution including supply chain improvements and more efficient and effective marketing support through digital are delivering results. In addition, we are leaning into our top performing skews to capture opportunities to expand distribution. While our brands remain strong, we are continually focused on new innovations to expand the appeal and market opportunities for our products. For instance, the Jimmy Dean Griddle Cakes platform is an innovation we are very proud of. We've launched two flavors, maple and blueberry, and we're seeing an exceptionally strong repeat rate and customer adoption making it one of the most successful Prepared Foods innovation over the past five years. Our focus on execution and innovation are keeping us on track to deliver another solid performance for the year. As I mentioned, chicken had one of its best quarters in some time, but we are clearly benefiting from better market conditions including lower grain costs, our actions and focus on the fundamentals across all aspects of the value chain are also contributing to these strong results. Our live operations continue to improve with hatch rate and livability up year-over-year. We generate efficiencies and improve utilization in our plants by optimizing our network. Our demand planning and customer service have also taken significant steps forward as we improve order bill rates and continued to build long-term partnerships with customers all the while reducing inventory. We've reinvested some of the proceeds from these improvements into the long-term growth of our value added chicken business. For instance, we've accelerated the ramp up of our Danville Fully Cooked facility and launched new products like honey bites and restaurant quality wings. In summary, our focus on the basics has built a fundamentally stronger chicken business with an eye on the future. Moving to beef, as expected, elevated cattle costs continue to compress spreads in fiscal Q3. While pasture conditions have improved this year, clear size of meaningful herd rebuilding have not emerged. We continue to be laser-focused on the things we can control, such as labor utilization, yield, and mixed management to meet consumer demand and customer needs as we manage through the challenges of the cattle cycle. Turning to pork, the overall health of the herd and the productivity of styles remain strong, driving an ample supply of lean hog, combined with solid demand and the benefits of our improved operational execution. AOI increased noticeably versus last year. Now let me take a moment to reflect on who we are. Our purpose is to feed the world like family, where protein remains clearly at the center of the plate. In fact, protein is the largest category in the retail food and beverage sector, accounting for about one third of sales in the U.S. We believe protein plays a central role in any healthy diet. This is why we see consumption growth is up 1.3% across feed, chicken, and pork in fiscal Q3 per Nielsen [ph]. And is also why we have protein as a foundational core. Our strategy encompasses our differentiated capabilities and scale and our diverse portfolio across channels, categories, and eating occasion. Our strategic pillars are supported by key enablers of operational excellence, customer and consumer obsession, along with data and digital. One key goal is building on our iconic brands to value up our core proteins. Today, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, and Hillshire Farm are three of the top 10 protein brands with room to expand household penetration. Brands are our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margin, and stronger returns, and is the most effective way to generate long-term shareholder value. As I've emphasized all year, our priorities are centered on controlling the controllables, including cash management. Our cash flow performance this year demonstrates the success we've had on this front. We're also focused on operational excellence by continuously improving chicken, strengthening Prepared Foods, navigating beef through a difficult cattle cycle, and driving efficiencies in pork. We came into fiscal 2024 with plans to deliver against these priorities. Our focus on being intentional and deliberate on executing those plans is delivering tangible results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt to review our financial performance in more detail. Thanks, Curt. Before we get to your questions, I want to express my deep gratitude to our incredible team members. Your dedication and hard work are the driving forces behind our mission to feed the world-like family and bring high-quality food to every table in the world. Together, we have achieved a remarkable turnaround and our momentum continues. Finally, I am grateful to our customers and consumers for their trust, loyalty, and partnership. I couldn't be more excited for the opportunities ahead of us and remain confident that our strategy will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder value. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. Good morning Ken and thank you for the question. Let me start with we are pleased with our Q3 results which is the best quarter in the last seven. We are seeing the benefits of our multi-protein portfolio where chicken, prepared and pork are offsetting the headwinds in beef. In Q3 momentum continues to strengthen, and all of our businesses are executing better than they have in quite some time. We're executing against the priorities we laid out for fiscal year 2024. In short, we are controlling the controllables, we are optimizing our network, and we remain focused on operational excellence. We have taken decisive action to drive performance and to build financial strength. Our performance has given us confidence to raise our guidance again. Now let me step into the segments, and I'll start with chicken. Our focus on the fundamentals behind the number one brand is delivering results. Chicken had a strong Q3. We had the best adjusted operating income since fiscal year 2016, it was eight years ago. Best capacity utilization since Q4 of 2018, six years ago. The best livability since fiscal year 2020. Supply chain and S&OP processes is allowing us to improve order fill rate while simultaneously lowering our inventory and working capital. In beef, we're managing through volatility and spread tightening. We continue to focus on operational excellence. In pork, better spreads and ongoing operational execution led to better profitability. In Prepared Foods, our results were in line with our expectations, our brands are strong, and our share remains healthy. So, thanks Ken. Just as a reminder, in the protein space, there typically are lower levels of elasticity. And protein is a consumer staple. And I'd also remind you, Ken, and then I'll pass this over to Melanie to add a little more color on Food Service. But in retail, we hold leadership positions in 8 of 10 categories, and three of the top 10 brands in protein. So with that, Melanie, why don't you speak a little bit to... So Ken, thank you for the question. Let me start by saying, I'm going to take this opportunity to pass this question over to our Chief Architect in Poultry, Wes Morris. He's been the person responsible. He and his team for the chicken turnaround that we have seen. So Wes? So if I could add one thing to that. Thank you, Brady. Our asset base is we're well invested, and we are capable of running with the very best in the industry. I'll remind you, Adam and others that the benefits of our multi-protein portfolio, which is driving our momentum with the strength in chicken and prepared foods and pork, and we see that offsetting challenges in beef. We see that continuing for the balance of the year. Sure. Andrew, let me just say this. In terms of 2025 outlook, it's a little bit early for us. We'll be happy to discuss at length in Q4. So look forward to that. Just a reminder, there is no -- data doesn't support herd rebuild at this point but -- on a positive note, pasture conditions and feed costs are supportive of a herd rebuild. Interest rates, for example, might be a headwind, but there's no clear sign of herd retention. Brady, why don't you go deeper into that? And if I could, I would add this to Brady's comments, once again, Heather, the benefits of our multi-protein portfolio the momentum and the strength which we have there where chicken, prepared foods, pork and even our international business offsetting those -- this cattle cycle that we're in. So we've been able to do that, did that well in Q3, and I would expect that for the balance of the year, and we think we will have a good overall fiscal 2025. It's too early to talk about that in great detail, but we're very optimistic about 2025. Sure. Our international business does continue to grow. And if you'll recall, over the last couple of years, we've invested heavily behind a number of assets in China and Southeast Asia. I would tell you, in those marketplaces, there are a number of macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. We have seen a little better improvement in raw materials. But to go any deeper into that, let me introduce Devin Cole, who is new to this call, but not new to Tyson and he's just returned to our company in March. He's been the Head of our Global McDonald's business. And now we've added the International business on to him. And so with that, Devin, welcome, and please go ahead. So if I may just add one other thing to that, Devin and thank you. As many of you will recall, Amy, too, was the leader of our International business. Since we were together last, Amy has decided to retire. And I know she is probably listening today, and I just want to say that we miss her and thank her for many contributions to the company. We wish Amy and her husband Christian well. But we have Devin in the seat now and look forward to many exceptional things as it relates to International. So if I could add one thing to that Wes has mentioned two or three times, but just to make sure it's clear, that from a mix perspective, Wes and his team are continuing to value up the mix from, let's call it, more commodity-oriented products to more value-added branded across Retail and Food Service. Sure. If I look at the team that's sitting around the table here this morning, we have some of the best people in the industry, in their specific discipline. They have a great deal of experience, and they are very passionate and competitive in everything they do. But the mantra that we have here at Tyson is one team, one Tyson, all behind our mission, feeding the world like family. And at the same time, making sure that there's high-quality protein on every table in the world. But the collaboration component of that is a team coming together and really being united around this one Tyson approach. Thank you for your continued interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon."

            "content": "Well, thanks Adam for the question. And I'll just start with saying this, it's going to be very challenging to continue to really forecast the outcomes relative to this beef cycle. Every beef cycle has some differences embedded within it. And one of the key indicators relative to the cycle is droughts and monitoring drought in specific areas. So as you alluded to, we haven't seen really any notable retention to date. We've seen some differences relative to specific regions. And I would say that correlates really well relative to what those specific regions have from a climate and drought perspective. So when you definitely really evaluate as we move forward, what we do know is we're not expecting any incremental supply here in the short-term, which is consistent with these beef cycles. However, we're really focused on what we can control. And the highlights for our beef team have been decreased costs year-over-year relative to our manufacturing and our efficiencies have improved in our assets. We continue to see improvements in our yields, in our plants. We're doing a better job of balancing our supply and demand of cattle to beef and what our consumers and customers are demanding as well. So when you parlay all of those things together, we'll continue to manage what we can control and focus on really indications in the future on this rebuild. Sure. And thanks for the question, Andrew. And specifically on our beef performance, we are completely dialed in to making sure that we have cost-effective operations. And so everything from our harvest efficiencies and our assets to our yields to making sure that we are dialed in with our customers and consumers and balancing that to the type and kind of cattle that we're procuring and making sure that we understand those value equations, is where we've seen improvements in our operations. And the real call out for us, again, is the significant year-over-year decrease in our manufacturing cost and our assets. We're running a much better operation today than we were a year ago, and we're certainly proud of that and thank the team for their continued improvements in these areas. Thanks for that question Heather. And again, I just go back to that drought monitor, the USDA and NOAA published and produced. And so through the last cycle, obviously, we saw a drought in that 2012, 2013 and then a relatively good rebound in 2014, 2015 and 2016. And then really, from a drought perspective in beef cow country, really, really low persistence relative to drought in the 2019 that led into some really good numbers here within the last three to five years. And so we'll continue to evaluate and understand and focus on that. That's really a prerequisite to this rebuild. Donnie outlined some of the other factors that are in play relative to the rebuild as well. But just to reiterate what Donnie said as well, we've made really good investments in our beef operations, and we like our asset base. We like our team. We like the supply partnerships we have, both on the cattle supply and the partnerships we have with our customers as well and really have laid out a variety of range of outcomes and understanding where the cycle really go and win most importantly, and we'll continue to evaluate that as we move forward."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Wes Morris",
            "content": "Yeah, thanks Donnie. Overall, I'd say I'm very pleased with the improvement in our cost fundamentals, and we're well poised for growth. Nothing's really changed. The big three areas that we've talked about the last few quarters around our live plant and S&OP. Our live results continued to improve. Our hatch was up 360 basis points versus a year ago, just short of 83. Our livability improved 50 points to 93.71 [ph] in a pretty tough grow-out environment. And then our cost 500 on the in bench mail [ph] and then a very deliberate focus on our live fundamentals are paying big dividends. The network changes that are paying off. Capacity utilization, as Donnie said, continues to improve sequentially and we still have room to grow. And then our S&OP process continues to add value. Service was up 100 basis points on an order field, while reducing our working capital around $260 million. We have a really highly functioning demand planning and supply planning team and our total poultry group is engaged in that area. Now we invested some of that operational improvements back into the business. As you know, we have the number one share in retail and Food Service, and we're focused on investing there. So our Danville fully cooked plant is well started up, that location is about a year ahead of schedule from what we originally anticipated. We've got a strong innovation pipeline. We've invested in quality and consumer promotions. And so I think our range is good. We've raised our guidance 850 to 950. Historically, Q1 and Q3 is our best quarters with Q2 and Q4 being a little softer and then the ongoing investments. So I feel well balanced at the midpoint. Yeah, this is Wes. I would say that we continue to focus on the fundamentals. We got a little different business mix and business volatility than some of the commodity players as we don't sell a lot of outside raw materials where price is immediate. We've got several pricing models. Some are grain-based and so as grain has come off, we pass that on to the customers, and that's fair. And then we have a high percentage of packaged goods and so we're going to stay focused on stabilization of earnings over time, strong relationships with key customers, and sustainable value creation. So regardless of what markets are doing, I expect us to deliver best-in-class results over time and stay focused on the controllables. Yes, sure, Heather. Thank you for the question. We see the USDA data and no question the industry exits and wages are well up, but the bird simply aren't making it to the plant. And so our genetics and strategic focus are just the opposite. I did say our hatch is up 360 basis points. I do believe it is sustainable. I think we've got the right programs in place. We're seeing intense focus on the execution. Our grower partners are buying into the performance and our livability is up 50 points even in a tough grow-out environment. So we're obviously outperforming in live. And yes, I believe that to be not only sustainable when we hit the fall cooler weather, I expect it to improve. Yes. I'll take a big part of that change and it's pretty simple. Our poultry team is improving faster than I expected or that we modeled in a lot of different areas. Like live for instance, that we just talked about or our supply demand planning group. And so we haven't called a different play. We've just executed it faster than I expected. Yeah, thanks for the question Peter. As I've said, we had solid improvement in our fundamentals, and we partially offset those by investments. If I had to call the year today, I'd call it 40% performance base, 60% market-based. But if I adjust for the investments, I'd call it around 50-50. But it's important that my team stay focused on sustainable performance and driving value over time regardless of what those market conditions are. So again, Alexia, thank you for the question. We're laser focused on the fundamentals of our business. Certainly, grains have an impact. Our commercial relationships, we continue to work with some key customers to help stabilize earnings and create win-win solutions with those key customers. So it's -- for me, it's about staying focused on what we do and getting better at it every day."

But I would tell you, I'm encouraged by the quality of our team, assets that I've had the chance to see around the world. We're really focused on some very key metrics, and that's just to keep our team members safe, make sure we've got the best food safety, the best product quality innovation for all of our customers around the world and also focused highly on operational excellence as we bring these new facilities up to speed. And I am convinced that we have the assets and the team to deliver the portfolio of products to meet both customer and consumer needs around the world. And really what this will allow us to do is to provide the growth in results that we expect and that we need to drive the operational efficiencies and capacity utilization in these assets."

            "name": "Curt Calaway",
            "content": "Thanks, Donnie. Total company net sales of 13.35 billion in Q3 were up 1.6% year-over-year. The increase was led by beef with contributions from pork and Prepared Foods partially offset by declines in chicken and international. Adjusted operating income improved $312 million to nearly $500 million, driven primarily by another quarter of substantial increase in chicken profitability. Operational improvements and substantially higher AOI led to a $0.72 increase in adjusted EPS, which came in at $0.87 in Q3. As Donnie mentioned earlier, this is our best AOI, AOI margin, and adjusted EPS in the past seven quarters. Now let's review our segment results starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q3 revenue grew 2.1% versus last year driven by volume growth in Food Service. As we expected, AOI in Q3 was down modestly, higher raw material costs were partially offset by lower map spend versus an elevated level last year, and the benefits of operational efficiencies and top-line growth. Moving to chicken, sales in Q3 declined 3.2%, primarily due to the pass-through of lower input costs and pricing. While volume is roughly flat year-over-year, as we continue to better align supply with customer demand, it was up approximately 2% from Q3 of fiscal 2022. AOI increased $370 million versus last year to $307 million. Lower input costs, net-of-pass-through pricing, along with the benefits of the strategic actions we have taken and the efficiencies the business has driven across our operations, drove the growth in AOI. We also experienced favorable year-over-year derivative impact of $63 million, primarily related to a $65 million net derivative loss in Q3 last year. In beef, revenue was up 5.8% year-over-year in the quarter primarily due to the volume impact of higher average carcass weights, with pricing increasing 1.4%. While revenue increased, AOI decreased primarily reflecting compressed spreads as expected, which more than offset our continued progress on operational efficiencies. Moving to pork, Q3 revenue increased a net 10.4% driven by higher price per pound reflecting healthy global demand. AOI also increased $92 million year-over-year benefiting from improved spreads and better operational execution. Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Our commitment to disciplined capital allocation remains unchanged. Our priorities are to maintain financial strength, invest in the business, and return cash to shareholders all while maintaining our investment grade credit rating. Cash flow from operations remains strong, with year-to-date approaching $2 billion, highlighting improved profitability and working capital management. Operating cash flows was more than double our CAPEX, which came in at $884 million year-to-date. CAPEX in Q3 of $263 million declined sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter, reflecting our focus on controlling capital deployment while continuing to invest for profitable growth. Year-to-date free cash flow of $1.1 billion is more than two and a half times better than the previous two fiscal years combined over the same period. We ended Q3 with $4.8 billion of liquidity. Improving profits and strong cash management are also benefiting our net leverage, which declined sequentially again, coming in at three times in Q3, more than a full-turn lower than where we exited fiscal 2023. We continue focusing on returning net leverage to our long-term target of at or below two times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We entered fiscal 2024 with a plan of applying our controlling the controllables approach to enhance free cash flow generation. We've over-delivered on that plan and remain committed to deploying resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now let's look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. We are reiterating our overall sales guidance at roughly flat year-over-year. Based primarily on our improved outlook for chicken, we are raising our AOI guidance and tightening the range. For the total company we now expect between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. Moving to the segments, in chicken, given the strong performance we're raising our AOI guidance range to be between $850 million and $950 million. For Prepared Foods, we are reiterating our AOI outlook of $850 million to $950 million as we continue to perform in line with expectations. In beef, we are tightening our AOI guidance range to a loss between $400 million and $300 million, reflecting well-known challenges in the cattle cycle. In pork, we are raising our AOI outlook to be between $100 million and $200 million highlighting improved year-to-date results versus expectations. To round out the key P&L items, we continue to anticipate interest expense to be roughly $395 million and our tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. Turning to CAPEX, we are maintaining our tight controls on spending in line with profitability and cash flows, and are narrowing our CAPEX range to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion this year. Before I turn the call back over to Donnie, I want to emphasize that our multi-protein, multi-channel strategy is enabling us to raise the midpoint of our full year AOI guidance by $100 million. Now, I'll hand it over to Donnie to wrap up before we move to Q&A. Yeah, thanks. This is Curt. I'll kick it over to Wes in just a minute. But principally speaking, right, we talked about the back half of the year and a little bit of seasonality challenges that we perhaps could have. But to be specific on your question before I turn it over to Wes, it was really some stronger chicken performance than we had anticipated when we talked three months ago. But overall, kind of the construct that we thought about the back half of the year relatively in line. But certainly, as we said earlier, increased the overall midpoint of our guidance by $100 million, really with the strength of Q3 and I'll turn it over to Wes to talk a little bit about chicken's performance. Thanks Peter. Yes, you're right. Maybe the best way to handle that is think about our liquidity. And we finished the quarter, right, with about $4.8 billion of liquidity. And that was partially driven by a bond offering that we did earlier this year to effectively prefund that, if you will. So yes, the bond maturity is coming up here in August of $1.25 billion, and we'll look to pay that off this month. Tom, this is Curt. I'll add a couple of things and then let Melanie add to it. But we are hopefully very clear last quarter where we talked about midpoint of the guidance of $900 million and implying obviously $400 million in the back half, and it would be split relatively even. I'll add to that, right. We -- while we've tightened the guidance range throughout the year, our midpoint has been consistent across the whole year. And specifically as well, our thoughts around Q4 and the profit outlook also were very unchanged and consistent as we've thought about it. But I'll let Melanie add a couple of elements from her perspective."

We've certainly come a long way from where we were a year ago and wouldn't be where we are today without their hard work. Our momentum continues to strengthen, and all of our businesses are running better today than they were last year. Our results this quarter are part of a solid performance in the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to the first half of last year. Adjusted EPS and adjusted operating income are both up nearly 60%, while operating cash flow increased by more than 50% and CapEx decreased by more than 40%. This performance gives us confidence in our improved outlook for the fiscal year and in our long-term future.\n As you saw in our results, tailwinds in Chicken again offset headwinds in Beef as we benefit from our multi-protein portfolio. While we're not immune to the macro environment, we are taking steps to reduce our exposure to commodity markets. We are expanding our offerings in seasoned and marinated meats to value up our portfolio across Beef, Pork and Chicken to provide consumers convenience and new flavor options. Across our brands, we are focusing on meeting the consumers where they are by offering convenient restaurant-quality food options at home.\n We are a leader in protein with some of the most iconic brands in food with offerings that span the value spectrum. This is why our share remains healthy despite a more challenging environment for consumers. We continue to support our brands through efficient marketing, effective innovation and strong partnerships with our customers. We continue to build financial strength by being disciplined in our capital deployment to improve cash flow and position us well to tackle challenges and capture opportunities. We also continue to take bold actions to improve performance and drive long-term value for shareholders, and I remain highly confident in our strategy and optimistic about our future. \n Now let's delve into an update on market share. At Tyson Foods, we have a broad portfolio of offerings across foodservice and retail at a range of price points to meet consumers where they are, even as they manage through a challenging macro environment. We also have some of the strongest and most iconic brands across food and beverage behind the Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm names, which allows us to make efficient choices to maintain margin, while strengthening our shelf position. We see this in the strength of our dollar share in our core business lines, which we believe reflects the quality of our share position. Since Q2 of fiscal 2019, we've added 400 basis points of dollar share in our core business lines. \n While our share is down modestly versus last year as we lap some record performance, we have gained dollar share over each of the past 3 quarters. Our core bacon brands, Wright and Jimmy Dean have contributed to this recent growth. In fact, our dollar share in bacon for Q2 was at a record high level over the past 5 years, and we were the fastest growing in the category during the quarter. I'm excited about our opportunities in bacon and expect our share to continue improving as our new bacon facility that opened in January ramps up. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonate strongly with our consumers, and our market share and household penetration rates remain healthy. We continue to have opportunity to expand the household penetration of our great brands, leaving room for continued share growth over the long run.\n Moving on to the segment performance, starting with Prepared Foods. Consumers' focus on value continues to impact our retail volumes. However, our share remains healthy. And as I mentioned, we are gaining dollar share in bacon. Our volumes outside of retail continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification and margin-accretive channels. Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove solid profitability both in Q2 and the first half of fiscal '24. \n In Chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal '23 continued in Q2. In fact, versus the second quarter of last year, AOI increased more than $325 million. While we are benefiting from better market conditions, including lower grain costs, our bold actions and focus on the fundamentals are also evident in our results. We have made progress across the value chain. Our live operations are substantially better. We've improved yield, labor efficiencies and utilization in our plants. Our demand planning and customer service have also taken significant steps forward. When our live operations are running well and our demand plan is more accurate, we can operate more efficiently and better service our customers. In summary, our focus on getting back to the basics in Chicken is working. \n As you all know, in Beef, limited cattle supplies led to spread compression. Despite some quarterly volatility reflecting market conditions, our results for the first half of fiscal year have come in as we expected. Our goal remains to offset some of the challenges of a tight cattle supply environment by focusing on the controllables, such as labor utilization and managing mix to meet customer and consumer demand.\n Turning to Pork. Better spreads and ongoing operational execution led to improved profitability in the quarter in the first half of the year. As you may have seen, we made the difficult decision to close one of our pork facilities. This is part of our efforts to optimize our footprint and improve performance by reallocating resources to nearby more efficient plants, while improving mix and better serving our customers.  \n Now let me take a step back and talk about our recent corporate rebranding initiative. We launched a new corporate logo earlier this year that captures our One Team, One Tyson Spirit. It encompasses our differentiated capabilities and scale and our diverse portfolio across channels, categories and eating occasions. Our Tyson Foods corporate logo represents our company's legacy and our team's purpose, which is to feed the world like family. \n Our approach to driving long-term value hasn't changed and is built on a core of 3 key pillars. First, we are fortifying our foundation of core proteins. We strive to be best-in-class operators while continuing to look for ways to value up our portfolio. Second, we are building our brands by delivering innovation for new occasions, categories and channels to better serve consumers. Today, we have 3 of the top 10 protein brands with room to expand our household penetration. Brands are our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margins and stronger returns. Third, we're growing globally. Our international business grew revenue eightfold to $2.5 billion over the 5 years through fiscal '23. \n We expect to drive profitable growth over time by capturing expanding consumer markets, particularly in Asia, and we believe we are well positioned to win. These strategic pillars are supported by key enablers of operational excellence, customer and consumer obsession, along with data and digital. A key element of operational excellence is to gain enterprise scale and unlock savings in our controllables by modernizing our operations and driving performance to standards. We win with our customers by building long-term partnerships and delivering top-tier experiences. We enrich consumers' lives by creating best-in-class marketing and innovation. Finally, we continue to build our digital capabilities utilizing data, automation and AI tech for better decision-making and outcomes.  \n Before I hand it over to John to review our financial performance, let me remind you of our priorities this year, where we focused on controlling the controllables. Our results for the first half of the year clearly shows that we are controlling our CapEx and working capital to drive strong cash flow. Another priority is to optimize our footprint and network. We've closed the last of the 6 chicken facilities that we announced in 2023, along with the 2 case-ready beef facilities. And as mentioned earlier, we are closing one of our pork plants. \n We're also focused on operational excellence by restoring performance in Chicken, strengthening Prepared Foods, managing Beef through a difficult cattle cycle and driving efficiencies in Pork. As you have seen in our results so far this year, we are making tangible progress in all these areas. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. \nJohn Tyson: Thanks, Donnie. I'll start with an overview of our total company results before moving on to our individual segments. Sales in Q2 were essentially in line year-over-year at $13.1 billion as a decrease in Chicken was nearly offset by an increase in Beef. Adjusted operating income increased $341 million year-over-year to $406 million, driven primarily by significant improvement in Chicken profitability. Operational performance and substantially higher AOI led to a $0.66 increase in adjusted EPS, which came in at $0.62 in Q2.  \n Now let's review our segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q2 revenue was down slightly year-over-year. Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition. The pricing decline reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q2 was down modestly versus last year. Lower raw material costs and operational efficiencies were more than offset by start-up costs and mix. Despite the decline in AOI, our margin for the first half of the fiscal year remained in the low double digits.  \n Moving to Chicken. Sales in Q2 declined 8.2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume. Volume declined 6.1%, driven by lower production as we better aligned our supply to customer demand, while the 2.1% reduction in pricing was due in part to the pass-through of lower input costs. Despite the decline in sales, AOI increased $326 million year-over-year to $160 million. The benefits of our strategic actions and the substantial operational improvements we've executed since last year are clear. Market conditions, including lower input costs, net of pass-through pricing and a better supply-demand balance were also key contributors to improved profitability. The current quarter results include a $55 million derivative loss compared to a $35 million loss in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, our grain hedging program is part of an overarching risk management strategy and not a speculative tool.  \n In our Beef segment, revenue was up 7.3% year-over-year in Q2, with both volume and pricing increases. The 2.8% increase in volume was primarily driven by higher average carcass weights, while pricing increased 4.5%. While revenue increased, AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads as expected. This more than offset continued progress on our operational efficiencies, including better labor utilization and better management of product mix to meet customer and consumer demand.  \n Moving to Pork. Q2 revenue increased 4.6%, driven by volume growth and higher pricing. Volume growth of 2.9% was led by more plentiful hog supply. Pricing improved due to healthy global demand. AOI also increased year-over-year going from a loss of $31 million last year to a profit of $33 million this year in Q2, benefiting primarily from improved spreads and better operational execution. Year-to-date, pork AOI has improved $151 million. \n Finally, our International Business continues to make progress towards stronger profitability. AOI increased versus last year as we begin to lap some of the start-up costs of our newer facilities and continue to focus on operational execution. \n Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Year-to-date showcased strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion as we continue to manage working capital. We remain very disciplined with CapEx, which came in at $621 million for the first half. The $267 million in CapEx for Q2 was the lowest quarterly spend in several years and represents the fifth quarter in a row of sequential decline as we lap our elevated CapEx from the previous 2 fiscal years and focus on controlling where and when we deploy capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $556 million, increased nearly $900 million versus the first half of last year and was more than $200 million ahead of our year-to-date dividend payments.\n Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders, while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning net leverage to at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA. Our net leverage again declined sequentially, coming in at 3.6x in Q2, driven by improving last 12 months EBITDA, and we expect it to continue to improve for the balance of the year. \n We ended Q2 with $4.4 billion of liquidity. As you may have seen from our press release in March, we successfully raised $1.5 billion in new senior notes, and we paid down a portion of our term loans. We plan to use the remaining proceeds to retire our outstanding notes coming due this August. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.\n Now let's take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. We are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year-over-year. However, given our strong year-to-date results, we are raising our AOI guidance driven primarily by an improved outlook for Chicken. For the total company, we now expect between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion of operating income. \n Moving to the segments. In Chicken, given the strong start in the first half of the year, we continue to believe that there are more tailwinds than headwinds. We are raising our AOI guidance range to be between $700 million and $900 million. Prepared Foods also had a solid first half. In this segment, we are tightening our AOI outlook to be between $850 million and $950 million, indicating a weaker second half of the year, which reflects typical seasonality. In Beef, the first half of fiscal 2024 has progressed in line with our expectations. However, uncertainties remain, including the progression of the cattle cycle, and we now expect our full year AOI to be between a loss of $400 million and a loss of $100 million. In Pork, we've seen solid first half performance and are raising our guidance to be between $50 million and $150 million. \n To add some color to the shape of the rest of the year, uncertainties remain around consumer strength and behavior, the progression of the cattle cycle and key commodity costs. When we factor in these variables with Pork and Prepared Foods seasonality, there are reasons to believe that Q3 could be weaker than Q4. To round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million and our tax rate to now be approximately 24%.  \n Turning to CapEx. We're maintaining tight controls on spending in line with profitability and cash flow, and we are narrowing our CapEx range to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion this year. And finally, on free cash flow, we're committed to managing working capital and CapEx and we're even more confident now that we can fully fund our dividend this year through our free cash flow generation.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Donnie to wrap up before we move to Q&A. \nDonnie King: Thanks, John. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to thank our 139,000 team members, who worked tirelessly to feed the world like family and fulfill our mission to bring high-quality food to every table in the world. It is the strength of our team that secures our position as a world-class food company and a recognized leader in protein. Together, we delivered a solid first half, we still have more work to do and believe we have the strategy in place to continue our progress and deliver long-term shareholder value.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. \nSean Cornett: Thanks, Donnie. We will now move to your questions. Please recall our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. \nPeter Galbo: Donnie, maybe just to start, you typically gave, I think, kind of an update on the state of the business and things have improved to your -- sequentially at least pretty dramatically. I guess just curious a little bit on 2 things. One, kind of are you happy now with kind of the state of the portfolio and the state of plant closures and asset rationalization? And then secondly, just trying to understand the commentary around Q3 weaker than Q4 seasonally in light of what you've been saying that, that would run kind of counter to what has been the case seasonally for the past, I don't know, 5 or 6 years. So maybe if you can just unpack those 2 areas would be helpful. \nDonnie King: Thanks, Peter, and I appreciate everyone for being on this morning. Your first part of your question is essentially am I satisfied? I'm encouraged, I would -- I'd stop short of saying satisfied in terms of the results. I'm proud of the results that we delivered in Q2, and we're seeing the benefits of our diverse portfolio across proteins, channels, categories and eating occasions, where we saw Chicken and Pork are offsetting the headwinds in Beef. In our Q2, our momentum continues to strengthen on all of our businesses, and they're running better today than they were last year. \n We've come a long way from where we were a year ago, and my thanks to all of our team members for continued improvement in execution. We're executing against the priorities we laid out for fiscal '24. We are controlling the controllables. We're optimizing our network. We remain focused on operational excellence. We've taken bold actions to drive performance and to build financial strength. We're delivering meaningful results compared to the first half of last year in profitability, cash flow, CapEx in line with historical rates. Our performance has given us confidence to raise our guidance, while acknowledging uncertainties remain, and we have much work to do.  \n In terms of your specific question around Prepared, let me make a few comments, and then I'll pass it over to Melanie to add some detail. Our results were in line with our expectations. Our brands are strong and our share remains healthy. Persistent inflation is weighing on our bifurcated consumer. Our strategy is to meet the consumer where they are with offerings at various price points. \n In terms of more details, let me flip it over to Melanie to add a little color to your questions. \nMelanie Boulden: So Peter, I think you were asking specifically about our projections for Q3 as well as the rest of the full year. And so I'll just talk specifically about Prepared Foods and let any of the other leaders chime in. So the first half of the year, Prepared Foods delivered $500 million in AOI and you also know that profit delivery in the second half of the year has historically been lower than the first half, and we expect this year to be the same. So therefore, the midpoint of our second half guidance is $400 million. And I also want to point out that historically, Q3 has performed better than Q4, but we're seeing higher commodity costs in Q3, so we expect a pretty even split between the 2 quarters. \nPeter Galbo: Great. Melanie, that's very helpful. Yes, we've gotten certainly a number of questions on that. So thank you for the context. And then Donnie, maybe just as a follow-up. Look, we've had a number of companies this quarter, both in the CPG industry and in restaurants. Just kind of comment on the state of the consumer and low-income consumer. I know that was in some of your prepared remarks, but curious if you could dive a little bit deeper on just your view on food service and some of the channels that you service there. Just any commentary around quick service, casual dining and noncommercial would be helpful. \nDonnie King: Melanie, why don't you answer that? \nMelanie Boulden: Yes, happy to. So Peter, in both retail and foodservice, as you know, the consumer is under pressure, especially the lower income households. And in retail, we're seeing roughly 20% cumulative inflation over the last 3 years. Now the inflation impact, coupled with historically low savings rate has created a more cautious price-sensitive consumer. And we're also seeing a cautious consumer prioritized essential staples over discretionary categories. Now that said, we're advantaged, in that our protein categories enjoy lower levels of elasticity compared to the broader consumer landscape. And in retail, we're experiencing -- well, I should say, but in retail, we are experiencing a little slippage to private label with lower income households. However, our share remains strong with growth in bacon, snacking and sausage. \n Now in foodservice, where you specifically noted, we continue to deliver solid performance. but we are seeing shifts from fine dining into QSR. We're also seeing QSR slippage to more meals being consumed at home. But for Tyson, we're advantaged as we serve both in home and away-from-home consumers. The key point, I guess I'd like you to take away from all of this is that we've intentionally built the portfolio diversified across strong brands spanning multiple protein offerings and value tiers, and our scale allows consumers to find our products in multiple places throughout retail and foodservice channels. And this allows us to deliver on our goal of meeting our consumers where they're at, across a variety of value spectrum. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. \nBenjamin Theurer: Congrats on those very outstanding results. Just wanted to dig a little bit into the dynamics in Chicken that you've seen and kind of unpack a little bit the volume performance on the production side. Can you help us to kind of frame it a little bit more? Is it lower head? Is it lower weight? Is it a combination of it? What have you done differently in terms of like adjusting your operations to kind of have those sales down, but at the same time, with a very nice profit spread. And that would be my first question and a quick follow-up. \nDonnie King: I think I caught all the questions. Let me start out here was -- if I heard correctly, it was a kind of a supply question and then let me talk about that, and I will flip it to Wes to add some very specific details. But in terms of chicken supply, if you look at the publicly available data, USDA has projected chicken supply increased about 1% in 2024. But if you look at the data underneath it, there are some things that you need to get from this. This is a livability and hatchability story for the industry. If you look, pull it and [ hen ] mortality continues to be elevated. Broiler mortality continues to be elevated. Hatchability continues to be 3% to 5% below historical rates. \n So the net of all that is this. There will be fewer live pounds delivered to the processing plant than forecast. So if I look at that, I believe the supply will be lower than 1% projected by USDA. The other thing I would say with that is this is not a short-term fix. If you remember, we have a genetics company as well. And we've seen some of this activity as well. So this is -- can be a little bit of a longer-term issue. So you ask -- you didn't ask, but I would tell you, at least from our perspective, genetic selection over the last several years have been skewed towards broader characteristics like yield and feed conversion. There has been some impact -- the cumulative impact from no antibiotics ever across the supply chain. \n And there's some, I won't say, new disease, but the disease persists, creating mortality in the broiler. There's a new one -- or new to me called Avian metapneumonia virus that's out there. Laryngotracheitis, or LT, is out there today, and there are other things. But I think the supply could be -- will be less than 1% based on the data points I'm looking at and from flat to 0.5% or something along that order. \n Let me flip it to Wes and let him talk about our supply and see if that answers your question. \nWes Morris: Yes, Ben, we certainly see the USDA numbers projecting up 1%, but we're seeing the egg sets up, but slaughter pounds relatively flat. Now the good news is I'm very proud of our live performance. We hashed [ 82 34 ] in the quarter, livability is up 50 points year-over-year. And so looking at our live performance and then our S&OP process, our supply-demand group, we're in a good position for the back half of the year to stay balanced, to take care of our customers, and I'm very pleased with our live and supply-demand planning group. \n Specifically to Q2 volume, our volume is solid. It's consistent with Q1 and our expectations. Just as a reminder, 2023 is a challenging comparison period. Our pricing is solid. Just as a reminder, we lag a quarter to a quarter plus. And then the other dynamic unique to us is we have quite a few grain-based models that pull pricing down, but it does stabilize our margin. \nBenjamin Theurer: Okay. Perfect. And then just a quick follow-up on Beef in terms of like what you're seeing on the industry. Have you seen any signs of heifer retention to just what you like getting on the ground to get a better feel on how bad it is still going to get until it might get better? A little bit of the premium maybe into '25. \nBrady Stewart: Sure, Ben. This is Brady. And thanks for the question. And first of all, I guess, really at a high level, we haven't seen anything relative to any of the industry numbers that have been published that really indicate that true meaningful heifer retention has begun. And so at this point, we can potentially anticipate retention beginning in the fall, but there's some caveats to that. And certainly, as we shift from an El Nino weather pattern to a La Nina, the pasture conditions are extremely important to heifer retention. And there's a potential we could see some drier conditions as well persist. We'll continue to monitor that along with additional metrics around heifer retention and the percentage of heifer that move into slaughter. \n And then lastly, one of the promising signs would be we have seen a meaningful decline of the number of cows that are going to slaughter, down double digits from '22 and '23, both and so really, we find ourselves what looks like in the midst of a transition pattern, and we'll continue to monitor to understand the timing of that as we move forward. \nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. \nThomas Palmer: Maybe start off on the Chicken side, at least relative to consensus estimates, the guidance boost would seem to indicate more than just upside in the quarter. So maybe talk on the components that are driving that increased outlook for the second half of the year? I mean it does seem, obviously, like feed is favorable. It seems like the pricing environment it's getting better. And then you've had positive commentary on productivity. So just any help on kind of how much those items are helping, if there are other items to consider? And any quantification, of course, would be appreciated. \nDonnie King: Sure. Let me start off, and I will let Wes add a little color to this as well. But one of the things I got to point out is that the focus on the fundamentals that Wes and our Chicken team have had over the past year actually is quite impressive, and that's a result of some of this. I would point out this that there have been some market tailwinds that as far as Chicken is concerned. But of the $325 million that were better year-over-year, more than half of that came from execution type things, such as the footprint and network as well as some of the other tougher decisions that we made. \n And with that, Wes, why don't you cover some of the more specifics around the program. \nWes Morris: Yes, sure. We're certainly focused on controlling the controllables, and Donnie talked about live operational performance, which includes our network changes. And then probably the biggest change is making sure that we match our supply and demand. We've talked about the lives being better. Our plant performance and network optimization is right on target. Our capacity utilization continues to improve sequentially. We've improved our order fill rate while actually lowering our working capital over $400 million, driven almost exclusively by inventory. Demand solid and '23 is not a very good comp. \n Let me add a little more color to valuing up and our path forward. And so we have our new start-up plant in Danville. It is currently single shifted, and I expect due to demand will be double shifted by the beginning of '25. And so we are running a fundamentally stronger Chicken business. We've got strong [ BU ] leadership in place and strong future growth plans. So specific to your question, Q1, Q3 are typically our strongest quarters. So good balance front half and back half, grains have moderated, but are still higher than pre-COVID levels. We continue to watch the total protein availability. Obviously, spring and summer are better growing conditions so that should increase some volumes in the industry. \n We're also paying real close attention to the consumer behavior and how that may shift our mix. But we will be doing quite a bit of investing in the back half of the year, and our value-added business, where we have a #1 share in both retail and foodservice. And as I said earlier, we're ramping up Danville well ahead of schedule. If I could, I'd like to just reiterate something that to make it really clear in our Chicken business. Our strategy is very simple. It's live performance, excellence in live performance, it's operational execution and matching supply and demand. It's that simple. \nThomas Palmer: Right And then maybe a quicker one on Pork. Just with the costs falling, are you seeing any signs that the industry in terms of hog supply making better profits and might start ramping up supply at all or still a bit too early? \nBrady Stewart: Thanks for the question, Tom. Certainly, the compression we've seen on some of the feed stuff has helped move some numbers back to profitability within the industry from a Pork production standpoint, which is certainly good news for our producer partners as well. What we've seen consistently for the last year, which is of importance is we've seen genetic improvement across the entire industry, leading to additional pigs per liter. And when you compound that with the fact that we've seen over the last 10 years, probably the best year relative to true industry herd health. We're seeing ample supply as we move forward as well. \n So I'd be speculating if we commented on any potential expansion. But certainly, the environment is set up in a much better position versus last year. But let me be clear, when we look at our business, we really focused on the controllables and have seen good improvements from our Pork business through the first half of the year relative to operational excellence, relative to yields within our assets and relative to our mix management conversions as well. That's really coupled with the fact that we have plenty of runway ahead of us to continue to improve and get better, and that's the expectation as we move forward. \nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. \nAdam Samuelson: Maybe continuing on the discussion on controlling the controllables. Donnie, in response to the last question, you talked about kind of improvements in live operations, operational efficiency, kind of matching supply demand. I would just love to get your view on where the company is today and certainly notably improved versus where you were 12, 18 months ago. But where how much -- where can you get it to? How much kind of cost reduction on a per pound or millions of EBIT dollars, do you think is still kind of attainable, excluding changes in the external market environment in the Chicken business? \nDonnie King: Sure. Let me -- Chicken specifically, but let me start with the -- across the portfolio, just managing working capital and CapEx, driving cash flow and really in support of the dividend. That's still a priority for us and part of the controlling the controllables, optimizing the footprint and network, still a huge priority for us. Restoring Chicken performance is right there at the top and also strengthening our Prepared Foods business, really important to us. \n And then managing Beef through the cattle cycle. The unknown around that is, once we do see heifer retention, obviously, you were not going to be processing those animals. So what does that do? And we still got that coming our way and then continue to drive efficiencies in ports. As you stated, versus last year, every business is performing better. We had -- we raised the guidance primarily this quarter based on strong chicken performance, but let me acknowledge that there are still some uncertainties out there relative to the consumer and their strength and behavior, and that's still out there. I mentioned the cattle cycle already. Key commodity markets, what is -- there are tailwinds today, but what do they look like beyond our horizon. \n Pork and Prepared Foods seasonally -- could be seasonally weaker, will be seasonally weaker and then Q3 could be, I say could be weaker than Q4 driven by Prepared and Pork. Chicken. Chicken is -- we're seeing better execution in our Chicken business, and we've seen some time better capacity utilization than we've seen in some time. We're very optimistic in terms of where we are. And we've gone slow in our Chicken business. We've built this thing from the ground up, and we're excited about the momentum that we're seeing relative to that. \n Wes, do you think about Chicken specifically that I haven't said? \nWes Morris: Yes, I think I'd say it this way, Adam. In the long term, Tyson is the market leader in the industry, and I would fully expect us to deliver best-in-class results over time regardless of the market conditions, but we still got work to do. \nJohn Tyson: And Adam, I think -- this is John, just with one final clarifying point. You had a specific question around, can you quantify the operational performance opportunity? I would just say that -- we've got a range of guidance out there. I think that reflects the balance take and the midpoint of that is probably a reasonable place to be for the total company. But we've left things open a little bit on the top side and the high end of all the estimates of the various segments would reflect, at least what we believe to be achievable in our fiscal from an operational improvement opportunity. So I think that's about as much detail as we're intending to provide here. But safe to say, I think we see a lot of opportunities around the portfolio. The guidance reflects what we can get in '24, and we're optimistic about '25 and beyond, too. \nAdam Samuelson: Okay. No, that's all very helpful color. And if I could just ask a follow-up on Beef and taking, Brady, some of your comments about kind of uncertainty on if heifer retention has actually begun in earnest across the industry, but if it did, that would further reduce slaughter utilization for a period, while those cattle don't come to market. Again, under the spirit of controlling the controllables, if we actually are entering heifer retention cycle and herd rebuild cycle, can you help quantify the magnitude of controllables and beef that you actually have to mitigate kind of what would be a further drop in volume and throughput that I mean the business is already operating at a loss today. Presumably, that would be a meaningful incremental challenge. So could -- is there a path for the Beef business to make money through the worst of the heifer retention period? \nBrady Stewart: Thanks for the follow-up question there. And we've been pretty consistent with our message over the last few quarters, whereas there is absolutely a variety of expected outcomes here and how we move through relative to supply and pounds. One of the good signs we've seen is we have seen additional weight for carcass. And so that has provided some dilutive effect relative to cost structure, which is one of the concerns as you move through lower supplies, how that translates itself into potentially higher grading cattle is of interest as well, and we'll be monitoring that. But as we looked at the cycle and the potential outcomes of the cycle, we created a strategy that was completely focused on understanding a range of outcomes and how we can provide deliverables within those outcomes as well. \n And I'd just say we really appreciate and we like the strategy that we have developed, regardless of the range of outcomes on the supply side. We like the progress we have made year-to-date relative to controlling the controllables, which for us is operational excellence and efficiency within our assets, managing our mix and delivering to our customer, and we like the runway in front of us relative to improvements that we can continue to make as we move through what is going to be a range of outcomes through the cycle as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. \nHeather Jones: Congratulations on the quarter. Yes. I had a couple of questions. One on Chicken and one on Beef. And I just want to start on Chicken. I wanted to go back to the volume question. So I understand that Q2 was a more difficult compare than Q1, but it was a pretty substantial volume decline. And you always close the facility, but I think I remember those were going to be consolidated into other plants. So just wondering, is this production decline going to continue going forward? And was it lower outside meat purchases or lower internal production? Just wonder if you could help us how to think about the rest of the year going into '25. \nDonnie King: Sure, Heather. Let me start out and just maybe remind us of last year. In '23, at least the first half of '23 is not a real good comparator. If you look at Q1 of last year, we absolutely missed the demand signal in Q1 of last year, and that carried on into Q2 of last year. And so if you look at volume in Q2 of last year, versus Q2 of this year, you're going to see that it is down and -- but last year was really overstated. Volume growth was, in fact, there, but there was also issues with profitable sales as it relates to Q1 and Q2 last year. So we're beyond that, we've cleaned all of that up, and we're moving forward. We're running a much better business today in our Chicken business. \n And Wes, do you want to speak to the volumes? \nWes Morris: Yes, Heather, thank you for your question and asking for clarity. Our volume is in line with our expectations. We are well positioned in supply-demand balance. And we have strong growth plans put in place, and you'll start to see that in the second half. \nHeather Jones: Okay. And then a follow-up on Beef. More recently, beef demand seems to have been more challenged, and I don't know if it's related to the HPAI or what. But anyway, I just wonder if you could give us a sense of how your margins are tracking relative to where they were in Q2. \nBrady Stewart: Yes, Heather, thanks for the question. I would say relative to demand, we've seen a fantastic demand on both the Chicken side and the Pork side relative to retail promotional activity as well. While we've seen fantastic demand being driven by that retail and promotional activity, Beef really has not received much promotional activity at all. And so where in the past, as we move into the summer months, you've seen that activity. We'll be watching for that as we move into Q3 to see if we see additional promos, where retail specifically going to drive the consumer relative to any of the proteins. Luckily for us, we're in good shape on the Pork side, good shape on the Chicken side in terms of meeting that customer in those channels as well. \nDonnie King: So just to maybe cleanup for clarity, I think you may have misspoken on. It is Pork and Chicken, where we are seeing the future activity right now. \nBrady Stewart: That's correct. \nHeather Jones: And so have you seen any -- I know you narrowed your guidance and you took down the up the high end for Beef. I'm just wondering has there been any deterioration in margins relative to Q2, given that you haven't gotten the future activity you normally would have gotten at this time of the year for Beef? \nBrady Stewart: The Beef -- Beef promotion, that's been -- that's really been a calendar '24 story. And again, we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the remainder of the quarter, but we won't provide any additional guidance on Q3 other than what we've provided already. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. \nBen Bienvenu: So you noted that in the Chicken business, fairly equal contribution in the first half of the fiscal year of the improvement to what we saw last year between operational improvements and market improvements. As you look to the balance of the year, 3Q, 4Q, is it similarly equally split? Or should we see a diminished operational improvement contribution and more of the improvement is predicated on the market having strengthened? \nDonnie King: Well, let me say this in short, Ben, and then Wes can give you the details. As I mentioned in my opening statements, we have made great progress, but I would be -- I would also make sure that you understand that we believe there's still a lot of work to do. Good progress, but much work to do. And so you can define that financially, if you'd like, but we're not where we need to be yet in our Chicken business. \n But Wes? \nWes Morris: Yes, Ben, I'd say we certainly got more tailwinds than headwinds, and it's really a function of the volatility of the grain market, what ultimately happens in the supply and chicken markets and then the consumer mindset. And then as I've said a couple of times, we do have some go-forward investments in our value-added business in the back half of the year. \nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Very good. My second question is related to total company. And in particular, in years past, you all have gone through the exercise of articulating what you think kind of normalized earnings power is for the business and you've provided some clarity by segment. Not asking today what that earnings power is, but maybe when you think you all might be at a place where you can provide that level of clarity at the total enterprise and across the segments, given all the changes that you've made and the operational improvements that you've made progress against? \nJohn Tyson: Ben, this is John Randall. Let me try to answer that question. So short version, yes. We're not making any adjustments to long-term outlook on normalized ranges today. We plan to do that maybe as we go through the balance of this year and start to look to '25 and kind of give some color around that potentially. But let me take the opportunity just to talk about the shape of the total -- of the rest of the year for the total company and build on some things that have already been said today. \n So I just want to point out that from a total range standpoint, guidance has come above from midpoint to midpoint $350 million. We think that is reflective of the results year-to-date and some of our optimism for the balance of the year. And there's also a range of outcomes in there. And I think that we've -- despite some of the potential signals we see in Chicken around supply and demand, I think there's more tailwinds and headwinds there. I think going to our prepared segment, although we are experiencing some of the consumer behaviors that we've heard so many other companies talk about. I think we feel really good about our portfolio. And we've gotten questions about food away from home, food at home. We're in a pretty good position to win no matter where consumers are shopping. \n And I think that you kind of heard us say, hey, Q3 could be softer than Q4. I think I want to just put a point on that, that we see the rest of the year as being fairly balanced, but just with all of the various factors at play and some seasonality in Pork, especially there could be a tweak there, but don't want anyone to overread into that. We don't mean to get so overly precise. There's a lot of factors at play, and I would just emphasize that we're confident about the balance of the year and the midpoint to the guidance we've given. \nOperator: The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. \nAlexia Howard: So can I start with Chicken? I seem to remember that the [ ColdSnap ] in January hit production operations somewhat this quarter. Are you able to quantify any of that? How much it hit volumes and profitability for the segment overall? \nJohn Tyson: Alexia, this is John again. I would say that we typically plan for a little bit of that weather in the quarter. When we talked to you in February, we were pretty early on and had experienced some significant event just at that point, kind of one month in. I would say overall, though, the impacts in the quarter were not so significant that it had a disproportionate impact on earnings. So I think nothing to read into there. \nAlexia Howard: Okay. And then 2 quick things. How much longer do you expect the start-up costs in Prepared Foods to remain a headwind? When does that go away? And then finally, do you have a forecast for where you expect your leverage to end up by fiscal year-end? \nMelanie Boulden: Alex, this is Melanie. And in terms of our start-up costs, we may experience a little bit bleeding over into Q3, but we think the majority of them have hit in Q2. \nJohn Tyson: And to your second question, Alexia, on leverage, not placing a specific number where we expect to exit the year. But safe to say, we're definitely trending towards lower leverage and 2x or below is the long-term target. But that's as much as we can give right now. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. \nAndrew Strelzik: I wanted to go back to the Beef segment outlook. And you've mentioned some uncertainty and ranges of outcomes. I guess I'm just curious what is the environment that would get you to the top end of the Beef profit range versus the bottom end? Is it primarily around whether or not, we get heifer retention and herding rebuilding efforts in the fall, and that's kind of the biggest piece of it or the demand side, I guess, what are the range of outcomes that would get you to the top or bottom end of the range? \nBrady Stewart: Thanks for the question, Andrew. And specifically, we talk a lot about beef demand. We talk a lot about beef cutout pricing as well. But also, we need to factor in the fact that drop as a significant amount of value that falls within the beef supply chain and also our largest cost is relative to live cattle costs as well. And so when you really balance the 2 revenue streams, the cutout pricing and the drop pricing and you take that into account with live cattle and where potentially we could see some live cattle pricing going, that really creates the range of outcomes. It's trying to balance those 3, the 2 revenue and the 1 supply cost perspective when we look at particular guidance and the range of outcomes. \n But again, we still have plenty to control within Tyson. And we really focus on making sure that we balance the grade of cattle with the demands of the consumer as we move through the cycle as well. We're continuing to see improvements relative to efficiencies and yields. And really, we'll just continue to look at value streams that we can continue to generate to help offset some of these headwinds we have from a margin perspective. \nAndrew Strelzik: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is on the CapEx outlook. And I know last quarter, when it was reduced, you were kind of matching CapEx and the operating profit outlook. And so I guess I'm curious just how we should think about CapEx on a go-forward basis as the profit environment is better, since that hasn't really kept up and maybe there's timing dynamics and you've already mentioned controlling that tightly. But just as the profit dynamics get better, how should we think about the rate at which you might add back to CapEx? Where are the priorities where you might want to add back? Just any color around that on the go forward would be great. \nJohn Tyson: This is John. Let me take that question. So you are right in that we had talked in the past about being responsive to the operating environment and managing cash flows. I would tell you that, first off, we feel good about our free cash flow projection for the year in terms of being in excess of covering our dividend, so just pointing that out. But I would also tell you that the tighter range on our CapEx today, $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion that's really reflective of us determining what are the needs for the business and where are there opportunities for good investment. What I want you to take away from that is we're not turning on and off this big. It's kind of based on our outlook on profitability, but rather trying to return to a normalized level of spend. \n And you asked where would be the best opportunities for investment. I think the short answer is that our prepared portfolio and components of our chicken portfolio, where we see the best opportunity for the growing our value-added business, is where we want to continue to invest. And then, of course, we have our ongoing maintenance and repair that's needed. So I think that will probably paint a good picture for you on how we think about capital allocation. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. \nMichael Lavery: You had mentioned that you still have some work to do in chicken and you've touched on that a few ways, but can you just be clear how that does or doesn't apply to your footprint there? Is the supply-demand balance pretty well set? Or is that another piece of the equation that could evolve as well? \nJohn Tyson: Yes. Thanks for this question. So let me answer it in two ways. I think, first off, on the network moves that we've made up until this point. We anticipate that we have either recovered all or should recover nearly all of that -- all of the volume in chicken and nearly all of the volume related to our pork moves and the other moves. So I think I just want to be clear that when we talk about that rationalization, we're talking about being more efficient, taking cost out and losing none of the business. So I think that, that is a point we're emphasizing. \n The other part of your question was about chicken specifically, and I think that we even talked last year or a couple of quarters ago about the overall capacity utilization. Safe to say, we still got some headroom in our current footprint and would expect to grow with demand in the more profitable parts of our business. And so I think have a positive outlook based on all of the network moves. \nDonnie King: If I might add one more thing relative to chicken. The back half of the year for chicken, if you look, grains have moderated, the demand for chicken is very strong, and we've built a fundamentally stronger Chicken business. So we're excited about that. We're executing better, and demand is certainly working in our favor. \nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. And just on international. You've touched on it a couple of times earlier in the prepared remarks. Just how should we think about its margin runway? And what does it take for that to get a ramp-up in profitability? \nDonnie King: Well, thanks for the question on international. And I think it's important to remind this came up a little bit in the CapEx question. But I think we should remember over the last 2-plus years, we've built 12 processing plants around the world. That was part of the driver as it relates to the capital spend, and we're beyond that, and we're moving into filling up those capacities. But we're also lapping -- if you look at the International, we're lapping a ramp-up cost for the 7 facilities outside the United States, and our execution should continue to improve. Our focus short term is operational excellence and capacity utilization as it relates to our International business. \n Amy, would you like to speak? \nAmy Tu: Thanks for the question, Michael. As Donnie said, we are absolutely focused on delivering the results that is expected of us. So we're focusing on driving operational efficiencies across our plants. We are focused on improving our conversion costs. We're identifying available and open -- available capacity, reviewing our SKUs and delivering the more profitable mix of products, and we're also tightening our spending. So all of these actions are beginning to -- we're beginning to see the results and improve gross margins and AOI delivery. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the company for any closing remarks. \nDonnie King: Thanks for your continued interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Melanie Boulden",
            "content": "So Peter, I think you were asking specifically about our projections for Q3 as well as the rest of the full year. And so I'll just talk specifically about Prepared Foods and let any of the other leaders chime in. So the first half of the year, Prepared Foods delivered $500 million in AOI and you also know that profit delivery in the second half of the year has historically been lower than the first half, and we expect this year to be the same. So therefore, the midpoint of our second half guidance is $400 million. And I also want to point out that historically, Q3 has performed better than Q4, but we're seeing higher commodity costs in Q3, so we expect a pretty even split between the 2 quarters. Yes, happy to. So Peter, in both retail and foodservice, as you know, the consumer is under pressure, especially the lower income households. And in retail, we're seeing roughly 20% cumulative inflation over the last 3 years. Now the inflation impact, coupled with historically low savings rate has created a more cautious price-sensitive consumer. And we're also seeing a cautious consumer prioritized essential staples over discretionary categories. Now that said, we're advantaged, in that our protein categories enjoy lower levels of elasticity compared to the broader consumer landscape. And in retail, we're experiencing -- well, I should say, but in retail, we are experiencing a little slippage to private label with lower income households. However, our share remains strong with growth in bacon, snacking and sausage. \n Now in foodservice, where you specifically noted, we continue to deliver solid performance. but we are seeing shifts from fine dining into QSR. We're also seeing QSR slippage to more meals being consumed at home. But for Tyson, we're advantaged as we serve both in home and away-from-home consumers. The key point, I guess I'd like you to take away from all of this is that we've intentionally built the portfolio diversified across strong brands spanning multiple protein offerings and value tiers, and our scale allows consumers to find our products in multiple places throughout retail and foodservice channels. And this allows us to deliver on our goal of meeting our consumers where they're at, across a variety of value spectrum. Alex, this is Melanie. And in terms of our start-up costs, we may experience a little bit bleeding over into Q3, but we think the majority of them have hit in Q2."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. \n I'm pleased with our performance in Q2, and I want to thank our team members for their ongoing commitment to driving operational excellence. We've certainly come a long way from where we were a year ago and wouldn't be where we are today without their hard work. Our momentum continues to strengthen, and all of our businesses are running better today than they were last year. Our results this quarter are part of a solid performance in the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to the first half of last year. Adjusted EPS and adjusted operating income are both up nearly 60%, while operating cash flow increased by more than 50% and CapEx decreased by more than 40%. This performance gives us confidence in our improved outlook for the fiscal year and in our long-term future.\n As you saw in our results, tailwinds in Chicken again offset headwinds in Beef as we benefit from our multi-protein portfolio. While we're not immune to the macro environment, we are taking steps to reduce our exposure to commodity markets. We are expanding our offerings in seasoned and marinated meats to value up our portfolio across Beef, Pork and Chicken to provide consumers convenience and new flavor options. Across our brands, we are focusing on meeting the consumers where they are by offering convenient restaurant-quality food options at home.\n We are a leader in protein with some of the most iconic brands in food with offerings that span the value spectrum. This is why our share remains healthy despite a more challenging environment for consumers. We continue to support our brands through efficient marketing, effective innovation and strong partnerships with our customers. We continue to build financial strength by being disciplined in our capital deployment to improve cash flow and position us well to tackle challenges and capture opportunities. We also continue to take bold actions to improve performance and drive long-term value for shareholders, and I remain highly confident in our strategy and optimistic about our future. \n Now let's delve into an update on market share. At Tyson Foods, we have a broad portfolio of offerings across foodservice and retail at a range of price points to meet consumers where they are, even as they manage through a challenging macro environment. We also have some of the strongest and most iconic brands across food and beverage behind the Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm names, which allows us to make efficient choices to maintain margin, while strengthening our shelf position. We see this in the strength of our dollar share in our core business lines, which we believe reflects the quality of our share position. Since Q2 of fiscal 2019, we've added 400 basis points of dollar share in our core business lines. \n While our share is down modestly versus last year as we lap some record performance, we have gained dollar share over each of the past 3 quarters. Our core bacon brands, Wright and Jimmy Dean have contributed to this recent growth. In fact, our dollar share in bacon for Q2 was at a record high level over the past 5 years, and we were the fastest growing in the category during the quarter. I'm excited about our opportunities in bacon and expect our share to continue improving as our new bacon facility that opened in January ramps up. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonate strongly with our consumers, and our market share and household penetration rates remain healthy. We continue to have opportunity to expand the household penetration of our great brands, leaving room for continued share growth over the long run.\n Moving on to the segment performance, starting with Prepared Foods. Consumers' focus on value continues to impact our retail volumes. However, our share remains healthy. And as I mentioned, we are gaining dollar share in bacon. Our volumes outside of retail continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification and margin-accretive channels. Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove solid profitability both in Q2 and the first half of fiscal '24. \n In Chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal '23 continued in Q2. In fact, versus the second quarter of last year, AOI increased more than $325 million. While we are benefiting from better market conditions, including lower grain costs, our bold actions and focus on the fundamentals are also evident in our results. We have made progress across the value chain. Our live operations are substantially better. We've improved yield, labor efficiencies and utilization in our plants. Our demand planning and customer service have also taken significant steps forward. When our live operations are running well and our demand plan is more accurate, we can operate more efficiently and better service our customers. In summary, our focus on getting back to the basics in Chicken is working. \n As you all know, in Beef, limited cattle supplies led to spread compression. Despite some quarterly volatility reflecting market conditions, our results for the first half of fiscal year have come in as we expected. Our goal remains to offset some of the challenges of a tight cattle supply environment by focusing on the controllables, such as labor utilization and managing mix to meet customer and consumer demand.\n Turning to Pork. Better spreads and ongoing operational execution led to improved profitability in the quarter in the first half of the year. As you may have seen, we made the difficult decision to close one of our pork facilities. This is part of our efforts to optimize our footprint and improve performance by reallocating resources to nearby more efficient plants, while improving mix and better serving our customers.  \n Now let me take a step back and talk about our recent corporate rebranding initiative. We launched a new corporate logo earlier this year that captures our One Team, One Tyson Spirit. It encompasses our differentiated capabilities and scale and our diverse portfolio across channels, categories and eating occasions. Our Tyson Foods corporate logo represents our company's legacy and our team's purpose, which is to feed the world like family. \n Our approach to driving long-term value hasn't changed and is built on a core of 3 key pillars. First, we are fortifying our foundation of core proteins. We strive to be best-in-class operators while continuing to look for ways to value up our portfolio. Second, we are building our brands by delivering innovation for new occasions, categories and channels to better serve consumers. Today, we have 3 of the top 10 protein brands with room to expand our household penetration. Brands are our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margins and stronger returns. Third, we're growing globally. Our international business grew revenue eightfold to $2.5 billion over the 5 years through fiscal '23. \n We expect to drive profitable growth over time by capturing expanding consumer markets, particularly in Asia, and we believe we are well positioned to win. These strategic pillars are supported by key enablers of operational excellence, customer and consumer obsession, along with data and digital. A key element of operational excellence is to gain enterprise scale and unlock savings in our controllables by modernizing our operations and driving performance to standards. We win with our customers by building long-term partnerships and delivering top-tier experiences. We enrich consumers' lives by creating best-in-class marketing and innovation. Finally, we continue to build our digital capabilities utilizing data, automation and AI tech for better decision-making and outcomes.  \n Before I hand it over to John to review our financial performance, let me remind you of our priorities this year, where we focused on controlling the controllables. Our results for the first half of the year clearly shows that we are controlling our CapEx and working capital to drive strong cash flow. Another priority is to optimize our footprint and network. We've closed the last of the 6 chicken facilities that we announced in 2023, along with the 2 case-ready beef facilities. And as mentioned earlier, we are closing one of our pork plants. \n We're also focused on operational excellence by restoring performance in Chicken, strengthening Prepared Foods, managing Beef through a difficult cattle cycle and driving efficiencies in Pork. As you have seen in our results so far this year, we are making tangible progress in all these areas. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Thanks, John. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to thank our 139,000 team members, who worked tirelessly to feed the world like family and fulfill our mission to bring high-quality food to every table in the world. It is the strength of our team that secures our position as a world-class food company and a recognized leader in protein. Together, we delivered a solid first half, we still have more work to do and believe we have the strategy in place to continue our progress and deliver long-term shareholder value.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. Thanks, Peter, and I appreciate everyone for being on this morning. Your first part of your question is essentially am I satisfied? I'm encouraged, I would -- I'd stop short of saying satisfied in terms of the results. I'm proud of the results that we delivered in Q2, and we're seeing the benefits of our diverse portfolio across proteins, channels, categories and eating occasions, where we saw Chicken and Pork are offsetting the headwinds in Beef. In our Q2, our momentum continues to strengthen on all of our businesses, and they're running better today than they were last year. \n We've come a long way from where we were a year ago, and my thanks to all of our team members for continued improvement in execution. We're executing against the priorities we laid out for fiscal '24. We are controlling the controllables. We're optimizing our network. We remain focused on operational excellence. We've taken bold actions to drive performance and to build financial strength. We're delivering meaningful results compared to the first half of last year in profitability, cash flow, CapEx in line with historical rates. Our performance has given us confidence to raise our guidance, while acknowledging uncertainties remain, and we have much work to do.  \n In terms of your specific question around Prepared, let me make a few comments, and then I'll pass it over to Melanie to add some detail. Our results were in line with our expectations. Our brands are strong and our share remains healthy. Persistent inflation is weighing on our bifurcated consumer. Our strategy is to meet the consumer where they are with offerings at various price points. \n In terms of more details, let me flip it over to Melanie to add a little color to your questions. Melanie, why don't you answer that? I think I caught all the questions. Let me start out here was -- if I heard correctly, it was a kind of a supply question and then let me talk about that, and I will flip it to Wes to add some very specific details. But in terms of chicken supply, if you look at the publicly available data, USDA has projected chicken supply increased about 1% in 2024. But if you look at the data underneath it, there are some things that you need to get from this. This is a livability and hatchability story for the industry. If you look, pull it and [ hen ] mortality continues to be elevated. Broiler mortality continues to be elevated. Hatchability continues to be 3% to 5% below historical rates. \n So the net of all that is this. There will be fewer live pounds delivered to the processing plant than forecast. So if I look at that, I believe the supply will be lower than 1% projected by USDA. The other thing I would say with that is this is not a short-term fix. If you remember, we have a genetics company as well. And we've seen some of this activity as well. So this is -- can be a little bit of a longer-term issue. So you ask -- you didn't ask, but I would tell you, at least from our perspective, genetic selection over the last several years have been skewed towards broader characteristics like yield and feed conversion. There has been some impact -- the cumulative impact from no antibiotics ever across the supply chain. \n And there's some, I won't say, new disease, but the disease persists, creating mortality in the broiler. There's a new one -- or new to me called Avian metapneumonia virus that's out there. Laryngotracheitis, or LT, is out there today, and there are other things. But I think the supply could be -- will be less than 1% based on the data points I'm looking at and from flat to 0.5% or something along that order. \n Let me flip it to Wes and let him talk about our supply and see if that answers your question. Sure. Let me start off, and I will let Wes add a little color to this as well. But one of the things I got to point out is that the focus on the fundamentals that Wes and our Chicken team have had over the past year actually is quite impressive, and that's a result of some of this. I would point out this that there have been some market tailwinds that as far as Chicken is concerned. But of the $325 million that were better year-over-year, more than half of that came from execution type things, such as the footprint and network as well as some of the other tougher decisions that we made. \n And with that, Wes, why don't you cover some of the more specifics around the program. Sure. Let me -- Chicken specifically, but let me start with the -- across the portfolio, just managing working capital and CapEx, driving cash flow and really in support of the dividend. That's still a priority for us and part of the controlling the controllables, optimizing the footprint and network, still a huge priority for us. Restoring Chicken performance is right there at the top and also strengthening our Prepared Foods business, really important to us. \n And then managing Beef through the cattle cycle. The unknown around that is, once we do see heifer retention, obviously, you were not going to be processing those animals. So what does that do? And we still got that coming our way and then continue to drive efficiencies in ports. As you stated, versus last year, every business is performing better. We had -- we raised the guidance primarily this quarter based on strong chicken performance, but let me acknowledge that there are still some uncertainties out there relative to the consumer and their strength and behavior, and that's still out there. I mentioned the cattle cycle already. Key commodity markets, what is -- there are tailwinds today, but what do they look like beyond our horizon. \n Pork and Prepared Foods seasonally -- could be seasonally weaker, will be seasonally weaker and then Q3 could be, I say could be weaker than Q4 driven by Prepared and Pork. Chicken. Chicken is -- we're seeing better execution in our Chicken business, and we've seen some time better capacity utilization than we've seen in some time. We're very optimistic in terms of where we are. And we've gone slow in our Chicken business. We've built this thing from the ground up, and we're excited about the momentum that we're seeing relative to that. \n Wes, do you think about Chicken specifically that I haven't said? Sure, Heather. Let me start out and just maybe remind us of last year. In '23, at least the first half of '23 is not a real good comparator. If you look at Q1 of last year, we absolutely missed the demand signal in Q1 of last year, and that carried on into Q2 of last year. And so if you look at volume in Q2 of last year, versus Q2 of this year, you're going to see that it is down and -- but last year was really overstated. Volume growth was, in fact, there, but there was also issues with profitable sales as it relates to Q1 and Q2 last year. So we're beyond that, we've cleaned all of that up, and we're moving forward. We're running a much better business today in our Chicken business. \n And Wes, do you want to speak to the volumes? So just to maybe cleanup for clarity, I think you may have misspoken on. It is Pork and Chicken, where we are seeing the future activity right now. Well, let me say this in short, Ben, and then Wes can give you the details. As I mentioned in my opening statements, we have made great progress, but I would be -- I would also make sure that you understand that we believe there's still a lot of work to do. Good progress, but much work to do. And so you can define that financially, if you'd like, but we're not where we need to be yet in our Chicken business. \n But Wes? If I might add one more thing relative to chicken. The back half of the year for chicken, if you look, grains have moderated, the demand for chicken is very strong, and we've built a fundamentally stronger Chicken business. So we're excited about that. We're executing better, and demand is certainly working in our favor. Well, thanks for the question on international. And I think it's important to remind this came up a little bit in the CapEx question. But I think we should remember over the last 2-plus years, we've built 12 processing plants around the world. That was part of the driver as it relates to the capital spend, and we're beyond that, and we're moving into filling up those capacities. But we're also lapping -- if you look at the International, we're lapping a ramp-up cost for the 7 facilities outside the United States, and our execution should continue to improve. Our focus short term is operational excellence and capacity utilization as it relates to our International business. \n Amy, would you like to speak? Thanks for your continued interest in Tyson Foods. We look forward to speaking with you again soon."

            "name": "Brady Stewart",
            "content": "Sure, Ben. This is Brady. And thanks for the question. And first of all, I guess, really at a high level, we haven't seen anything relative to any of the industry numbers that have been published that really indicate that true meaningful heifer retention has begun. And so at this point, we can potentially anticipate retention beginning in the fall, but there's some caveats to that. And certainly, as we shift from an El Nino weather pattern to a La Nina, the pasture conditions are extremely important to heifer retention. And there's a potential we could see some drier conditions as well persist. We'll continue to monitor that along with additional metrics around heifer retention and the percentage of heifer that move into slaughter. \n And then lastly, one of the promising signs would be we have seen a meaningful decline of the number of cows that are going to slaughter, down double digits from '22 and '23, both and so really, we find ourselves what looks like in the midst of a transition pattern, and we'll continue to monitor to understand the timing of that as we move forward. Thanks for the question, Tom. Certainly, the compression we've seen on some of the feed stuff has helped move some numbers back to profitability within the industry from a Pork production standpoint, which is certainly good news for our producer partners as well. What we've seen consistently for the last year, which is of importance is we've seen genetic improvement across the entire industry, leading to additional pigs per liter. And when you compound that with the fact that we've seen over the last 10 years, probably the best year relative to true industry herd health. We're seeing ample supply as we move forward as well. \n So I'd be speculating if we commented on any potential expansion. But certainly, the environment is set up in a much better position versus last year. But let me be clear, when we look at our business, we really focused on the controllables and have seen good improvements from our Pork business through the first half of the year relative to operational excellence, relative to yields within our assets and relative to our mix management conversions as well. That's really coupled with the fact that we have plenty of runway ahead of us to continue to improve and get better, and that's the expectation as we move forward. Thanks for the follow-up question there. And we've been pretty consistent with our message over the last few quarters, whereas there is absolutely a variety of expected outcomes here and how we move through relative to supply and pounds. One of the good signs we've seen is we have seen additional weight for carcass. And so that has provided some dilutive effect relative to cost structure, which is one of the concerns as you move through lower supplies, how that translates itself into potentially higher grading cattle is of interest as well, and we'll be monitoring that. But as we looked at the cycle and the potential outcomes of the cycle, we created a strategy that was completely focused on understanding a range of outcomes and how we can provide deliverables within those outcomes as well. \n And I'd just say we really appreciate and we like the strategy that we have developed, regardless of the range of outcomes on the supply side. We like the progress we have made year-to-date relative to controlling the controllables, which for us is operational excellence and efficiency within our assets, managing our mix and delivering to our customer, and we like the runway in front of us relative to improvements that we can continue to make as we move through what is going to be a range of outcomes through the cycle as well. Yes, Heather, thanks for the question. I would say relative to demand, we've seen a fantastic demand on both the Chicken side and the Pork side relative to retail promotional activity as well. While we've seen fantastic demand being driven by that retail and promotional activity, Beef really has not received much promotional activity at all. And so where in the past, as we move into the summer months, you've seen that activity. We'll be watching for that as we move into Q3 to see if we see additional promos, where retail specifically going to drive the consumer relative to any of the proteins. Luckily for us, we're in good shape on the Pork side, good shape on the Chicken side in terms of meeting that customer in those channels as well. That's correct. The Beef -- Beef promotion, that's been -- that's really been a calendar '24 story. And again, we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the remainder of the quarter, but we won't provide any additional guidance on Q3 other than what we've provided already. Thanks for the question, Andrew. And specifically, we talk a lot about beef demand. We talk a lot about beef cutout pricing as well. But also, we need to factor in the fact that drop as a significant amount of value that falls within the beef supply chain and also our largest cost is relative to live cattle costs as well. And so when you really balance the 2 revenue streams, the cutout pricing and the drop pricing and you take that into account with live cattle and where potentially we could see some live cattle pricing going, that really creates the range of outcomes. It's trying to balance those 3, the 2 revenue and the 1 supply cost perspective when we look at particular guidance and the range of outcomes. \n But again, we still have plenty to control within Tyson. And we really focus on making sure that we balance the grade of cattle with the demands of the consumer as we move through the cycle as well. We're continuing to see improvements relative to efficiencies and yields. And really, we'll just continue to look at value streams that we can continue to generate to help offset some of these headwinds we have from a margin perspective."

            "content": "Yes, Ben, we certainly see the USDA numbers projecting up 1%, but we're seeing the egg sets up, but slaughter pounds relatively flat. Now the good news is I'm very proud of our live performance. We hashed [ 82 34 ] in the quarter, livability is up 50 points year-over-year. And so looking at our live performance and then our S&OP process, our supply-demand group, we're in a good position for the back half of the year to stay balanced, to take care of our customers, and I'm very pleased with our live and supply-demand planning group. \n Specifically to Q2 volume, our volume is solid. It's consistent with Q1 and our expectations. Just as a reminder, 2023 is a challenging comparison period. Our pricing is solid. Just as a reminder, we lag a quarter to a quarter plus. And then the other dynamic unique to us is we have quite a few grain-based models that pull pricing down, but it does stabilize our margin. Yes, sure. We're certainly focused on controlling the controllables, and Donnie talked about live operational performance, which includes our network changes. And then probably the biggest change is making sure that we match our supply and demand. We've talked about the lives being better. Our plant performance and network optimization is right on target. Our capacity utilization continues to improve sequentially. We've improved our order fill rate while actually lowering our working capital over $400 million, driven almost exclusively by inventory. Demand solid and '23 is not a very good comp. \n Let me add a little more color to valuing up and our path forward. And so we have our new start-up plant in Danville. It is currently single shifted, and I expect due to demand will be double shifted by the beginning of '25. And so we are running a fundamentally stronger Chicken business. We've got strong [ BU ] leadership in place and strong future growth plans. So specific to your question, Q1, Q3 are typically our strongest quarters. So good balance front half and back half, grains have moderated, but are still higher than pre-COVID levels. We continue to watch the total protein availability. Obviously, spring and summer are better growing conditions so that should increase some volumes in the industry. \n We're also paying real close attention to the consumer behavior and how that may shift our mix. But we will be doing quite a bit of investing in the back half of the year, and our value-added business, where we have a #1 share in both retail and foodservice. And as I said earlier, we're ramping up Danville well ahead of schedule. If I could, I'd like to just reiterate something that to make it really clear in our Chicken business. Our strategy is very simple. It's live performance, excellence in live performance, it's operational execution and matching supply and demand. It's that simple. Yes, I think I'd say it this way, Adam. In the long term, Tyson is the market leader in the industry, and I would fully expect us to deliver best-in-class results over time regardless of the market conditions, but we still got work to do. Yes, Heather, thank you for your question and asking for clarity. Our volume is in line with our expectations. We are well positioned in supply-demand balance. And we have strong growth plans put in place, and you'll start to see that in the second half. Yes, Ben, I'd say we certainly got more tailwinds than headwinds, and it's really a function of the volatility of the grain market, what ultimately happens in the supply and chicken markets and then the consumer mindset. And then as I've said a couple of times, we do have some go-forward investments in our value-added business in the back half of the year."

            "name": "John Tyson",
            "content": "Thanks, Donnie. I'll start with an overview of our total company results before moving on to our individual segments. Sales in Q2 were essentially in line year-over-year at $13.1 billion as a decrease in Chicken was nearly offset by an increase in Beef. Adjusted operating income increased $341 million year-over-year to $406 million, driven primarily by significant improvement in Chicken profitability. Operational performance and substantially higher AOI led to a $0.66 increase in adjusted EPS, which came in at $0.62 in Q2.  \n Now let's review our segment results, starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q2 revenue was down slightly year-over-year. Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition. The pricing decline reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q2 was down modestly versus last year. Lower raw material costs and operational efficiencies were more than offset by start-up costs and mix. Despite the decline in AOI, our margin for the first half of the fiscal year remained in the low double digits.  \n Moving to Chicken. Sales in Q2 declined 8.2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume. Volume declined 6.1%, driven by lower production as we better aligned our supply to customer demand, while the 2.1% reduction in pricing was due in part to the pass-through of lower input costs. Despite the decline in sales, AOI increased $326 million year-over-year to $160 million. The benefits of our strategic actions and the substantial operational improvements we've executed since last year are clear. Market conditions, including lower input costs, net of pass-through pricing and a better supply-demand balance were also key contributors to improved profitability. The current quarter results include a $55 million derivative loss compared to a $35 million loss in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, our grain hedging program is part of an overarching risk management strategy and not a speculative tool.  \n In our Beef segment, revenue was up 7.3% year-over-year in Q2, with both volume and pricing increases. The 2.8% increase in volume was primarily driven by higher average carcass weights, while pricing increased 4.5%. While revenue increased, AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads as expected. This more than offset continued progress on our operational efficiencies, including better labor utilization and better management of product mix to meet customer and consumer demand.  \n Moving to Pork. Q2 revenue increased 4.6%, driven by volume growth and higher pricing. Volume growth of 2.9% was led by more plentiful hog supply. Pricing improved due to healthy global demand. AOI also increased year-over-year going from a loss of $31 million last year to a profit of $33 million this year in Q2, benefiting primarily from improved spreads and better operational execution. Year-to-date, pork AOI has improved $151 million. \n Finally, our International Business continues to make progress towards stronger profitability. AOI increased versus last year as we begin to lap some of the start-up costs of our newer facilities and continue to focus on operational execution. \n Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Year-to-date showcased strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion as we continue to manage working capital. We remain very disciplined with CapEx, which came in at $621 million for the first half. The $267 million in CapEx for Q2 was the lowest quarterly spend in several years and represents the fifth quarter in a row of sequential decline as we lap our elevated CapEx from the previous 2 fiscal years and focus on controlling where and when we deploy capital. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $556 million, increased nearly $900 million versus the first half of last year and was more than $200 million ahead of our year-to-date dividend payments.\n Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders, while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning net leverage to at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA. Our net leverage again declined sequentially, coming in at 3.6x in Q2, driven by improving last 12 months EBITDA, and we expect it to continue to improve for the balance of the year. \n We ended Q2 with $4.4 billion of liquidity. As you may have seen from our press release in March, we successfully raised $1.5 billion in new senior notes, and we paid down a portion of our term loans. We plan to use the remaining proceeds to retire our outstanding notes coming due this August. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.\n Now let's take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. We are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year-over-year. However, given our strong year-to-date results, we are raising our AOI guidance driven primarily by an improved outlook for Chicken. For the total company, we now expect between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion of operating income. \n Moving to the segments. In Chicken, given the strong start in the first half of the year, we continue to believe that there are more tailwinds than headwinds. We are raising our AOI guidance range to be between $700 million and $900 million. Prepared Foods also had a solid first half. In this segment, we are tightening our AOI outlook to be between $850 million and $950 million, indicating a weaker second half of the year, which reflects typical seasonality. In Beef, the first half of fiscal 2024 has progressed in line with our expectations. However, uncertainties remain, including the progression of the cattle cycle, and we now expect our full year AOI to be between a loss of $400 million and a loss of $100 million. In Pork, we've seen solid first half performance and are raising our guidance to be between $50 million and $150 million. \n To add some color to the shape of the rest of the year, uncertainties remain around consumer strength and behavior, the progression of the cattle cycle and key commodity costs. When we factor in these variables with Pork and Prepared Foods seasonality, there are reasons to believe that Q3 could be weaker than Q4. To round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million and our tax rate to now be approximately 24%.  \n Turning to CapEx. We're maintaining tight controls on spending in line with profitability and cash flow, and we are narrowing our CapEx range to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion this year. And finally, on free cash flow, we're committed to managing working capital and CapEx and we're even more confident now that we can fully fund our dividend this year through our free cash flow generation.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Donnie to wrap up before we move to Q&A. And Adam, I think -- this is John, just with one final clarifying point. You had a specific question around, can you quantify the operational performance opportunity? I would just say that -- we've got a range of guidance out there. I think that reflects the balance take and the midpoint of that is probably a reasonable place to be for the total company. But we've left things open a little bit on the top side and the high end of all the estimates of the various segments would reflect, at least what we believe to be achievable in our fiscal from an operational improvement opportunity. So I think that's about as much detail as we're intending to provide here. But safe to say, I think we see a lot of opportunities around the portfolio. The guidance reflects what we can get in '24, and we're optimistic about '25 and beyond, too. Ben, this is John Randall. Let me try to answer that question. So short version, yes. We're not making any adjustments to long-term outlook on normalized ranges today. We plan to do that maybe as we go through the balance of this year and start to look to '25 and kind of give some color around that potentially. But let me take the opportunity just to talk about the shape of the total -- of the rest of the year for the total company and build on some things that have already been said today. \n So I just want to point out that from a total range standpoint, guidance has come above from midpoint to midpoint $350 million. We think that is reflective of the results year-to-date and some of our optimism for the balance of the year. And there's also a range of outcomes in there. And I think that we've -- despite some of the potential signals we see in Chicken around supply and demand, I think there's more tailwinds and headwinds there. I think going to our prepared segment, although we are experiencing some of the consumer behaviors that we've heard so many other companies talk about. I think we feel really good about our portfolio. And we've gotten questions about food away from home, food at home. We're in a pretty good position to win no matter where consumers are shopping. \n And I think that you kind of heard us say, hey, Q3 could be softer than Q4. I think I want to just put a point on that, that we see the rest of the year as being fairly balanced, but just with all of the various factors at play and some seasonality in Pork, especially there could be a tweak there, but don't want anyone to overread into that. We don't mean to get so overly precise. There's a lot of factors at play, and I would just emphasize that we're confident about the balance of the year and the midpoint to the guidance we've given. Alexia, this is John again. I would say that we typically plan for a little bit of that weather in the quarter. When we talked to you in February, we were pretty early on and had experienced some significant event just at that point, kind of one month in. I would say overall, though, the impacts in the quarter were not so significant that it had a disproportionate impact on earnings. So I think nothing to read into there. And to your second question, Alexia, on leverage, not placing a specific number where we expect to exit the year. But safe to say, we're definitely trending towards lower leverage and 2x or below is the long-term target. But that's as much as we can give right now. This is John. Let me take that question. So you are right in that we had talked in the past about being responsive to the operating environment and managing cash flows. I would tell you that, first off, we feel good about our free cash flow projection for the year in terms of being in excess of covering our dividend, so just pointing that out. But I would also tell you that the tighter range on our CapEx today, $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion that's really reflective of us determining what are the needs for the business and where are there opportunities for good investment. What I want you to take away from that is we're not turning on and off this big. It's kind of based on our outlook on profitability, but rather trying to return to a normalized level of spend. \n And you asked where would be the best opportunities for investment. I think the short answer is that our prepared portfolio and components of our chicken portfolio, where we see the best opportunity for the growing our value-added business, is where we want to continue to invest. And then, of course, we have our ongoing maintenance and repair that's needed. So I think that will probably paint a good picture for you on how we think about capital allocation. Yes. Thanks for this question. So let me answer it in two ways. I think, first off, on the network moves that we've made up until this point. We anticipate that we have either recovered all or should recover nearly all of that -- all of the volume in chicken and nearly all of the volume related to our pork moves and the other moves. So I think I just want to be clear that when we talk about that rationalization, we're talking about being more efficient, taking cost out and losing none of the business. So I think that, that is a point we're emphasizing. \n The other part of your question was about chicken specifically, and I think that we even talked last year or a couple of quarters ago about the overall capacity utilization. Safe to say, we still got some headroom in our current footprint and would expect to grow with demand in the more profitable parts of our business. And so I think have a positive outlook based on all of the network moves."

As you may have seen in our press release this morning, fiscal 2024 is off to a good start with solid performance in Q1 giving us confidence in our full-year outlook. The momentum we established in the back half of last year continued in Q1, highlighted by a $175 million improvement in adjusted operating income, a 130 basis points of AOI margin expansion and near doubling of adjusted EPS, all on a sequential basis. As we begin fiscal '24, we're witnessing the benefits of our core multi-protein portfolio. Chicken and Pork are offsetting Beef headwinds, while Prepared Foods continues to generate strong profit dollars and margins. While we can't control the macro environment, our focus on what we can control has been evident in Q1. Our performance reflects a commitment to operational excellence, we are more agile, collaborative, and disciplined business than a year ago, and we have a long runway of opportunities in front of us. I'm proud of our team members' continued efforts to enhance operational performance and want to thank all of them for their high level of engagement and their part in delivering our results in this quarter. We're controlling what we can to drive cash flow as well. Our disciplined approach to CapEx and working capital helped generate strong cash flow in the quarter. Prudent cash deployment is part of our strategy to build financial strength and will position us well when market dynamics turn in our favor. You've seen us take bold actions to improve performance, and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence and address inefficiencies. Our plan is working, and we're seeing tangible benefits of our efforts as evidenced by improvements in Chicken and Pork. While I'm pleased by the performance in Q1, we still have more work ahead of us, and we're cautiously optimistic and laser-focused on achieving what we set out to do this year. Our brands resonate with consumers, and we're maintaining strong market share despite comparing to our record position last year and some overall category consumption softness in Q1. We will continue to support our brands through innovation, marketing, and strong customer partnerships while meeting consumers where they are. I remain highly confident in our long-term strategy based on a broad portfolio of core proteins and strong brands and I'm optimistic about our future. We're leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let's delve into an update on share position of our branded portfolio. Our Q1 pound share in our core business lines, which include product lines from our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, State Fair, Aidells, and Ball Park, remains at historically high levels despite a modest decline compared to record share in Q1 last year. In fact, our core business lines have grown pound share by more than 400 basis points since Q1 of 2019. While inflation is easing, consumers are still facing high prices compared to two years ago. However, they are still willing to purchase brands they know and trust, and this is reflected in our share. We're also focused on customer elasticity and balancing with our own cost. We believe our approach is working. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonate strongly with consumers. Over the past year, nearly three out of four US households purchased a Tyson core business line product, and this penetration rate is growing. What gets me even more excited is that our product line with the highest penetration rate is only in about a third of households, leaving us plenty of room for continued growth over the long run. Moving on to segment performance, starting with Prepared Foods. Our foodservice volumes continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification and margin accretive channels. Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove strong adjusted operating profits and margins. Our Branded Foods business remains a strategic growth pillar, and we are committed to supporting and growing our brands through innovation, price pack architecture, high ROI marketing support and strong customer partnerships. This is critically important in an economic environment where consumers remain more discerning with their purchasing decisions. In Chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal '23 continued in Q1 with a third consecutive quarter of over $100 million in sequential AOI increase. Operational improvements, including the bold actions we've taken along with improvements in live operations, yield, labor efficiency, and customer service, as well as improving market conditions, were the primary drivers in Q1. In Beef, limited cattle supply led to spread compression as we expected. Roughly half the loss in Q1 was related to an inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily driven by highly volatile cattle futures. While spreads are expected to remain tight, our goal remains to be best-in-class operators so that we can manage the business as efficiently as possible. We have identified incremental opportunities to improve our execution and help offset some of the challenges from the current cattle cycle. Turning to Pork, better supply drove lower hog cost leading to improving spreads. Our team's focus on operational execution allowed us to capture the benefits of these favorable market dynamics, which resulted in improved profits both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before I hand it over to John for a financial review, let's reiterate our priorities for the year. First, we're committed to improving our financial strength and driving cash flow to support our dividend, as demonstrated in Q1. Over the past year, we announced the closure of six of our older, less-efficient plants in chicken and two of our smaller beef case-ready value-added facilities. We're already seeing the benefits of these actions and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to drive efficiency across our segments. In Chicken, our focus on enhancing our competitiveness continues. In Prepared Foods, we want to build growth momentum behind capacity additions coming online, increase our brand household penetration, and diversify and grow our foodservice business. In Beef, we acknowledge the challenges and will be prepared for multiple outcomes during the current cattle cycle. In Pork, we're gaining momentum in operational execution and are excited for continued improvements. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results and outlook.\nJohn R. Tyson: Thanks, Donnie. I'll start with an overview of our total company results before moving on to our individual segments. Sales in Q1 grew slightly year-over-year as an increase in Beef revenue was nearly offset by a decrease in Chicken. The decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in Beef, which was partially offset by growth in Chicken and Pork. It's important to note that AOI improved significantly on a sequential basis despite the modest decline versus last year. Adjusted EPS nearly doubled compared to last quarter, highlighting the ongoing improvement in our operational performance. Now, let's review our segment results starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q1 revenue was flat year-over-year. Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition and continued recovery in our foodservice business. Lower pricing primarily reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q1 was also in-line with last year. Lower raw material costs and operational efficiencies were offset by increased brand support expenses, start-up costs associated with new capacity additions and mix. AOI dollars and margin both increased significantly on a sequential basis due to strong operational performance and great seasonal execution by the team. Moving on to Chicken. Sales in Q1 declined 5.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of lower commodity protein prices. Volume declined 1.5% due to lower production, which was partially offset by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory. Despite the decline in sales versus last year, AOI more than doubled in Q1, primarily driven by the benefits of our strategic actions and other operational efficiencies. These include lower plant spend, improved yield and better live performance. While input costs were a clear tailwind, these were largely offset by the impact of lower pricing. As Donnie mentioned, this is the third consecutive quarter of more than $100 million of AOI improvement as we were able to pull forward the benefits of closures of inefficient plants in improvements in our live operations. Now moving to Beef. In Beef, revenue increased 6.4% year-over-year in Q1, with lower head throughput more than offset by higher prices per pound. While revenue increased, AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads, as was expected. As Donnie mentioned, in Q1, nearly half of the operating loss was driven by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily due to the rapid and significant decline in cattle futures. Moving to Pork, Q1 revenue was down modestly as volume growth was offset by lower pricing. However, AOI increased year-over-year, benefiting primarily from improved spreads driven by lower hog cost as well as better execution. And finally, a brief comment on our International business. AOI improved as we begin to lap some of the start-up cost of our newer facilities and continue to focus on improving execution despite a decline in sales, driven by macroeconomic challenges. Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Our commitment to building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders, primarily via our dividend, remains unwavering. While market conditions remain challenging, we are laser-focused on disciplined management and deployment our capital resources to drive cash flow. Q1 showcased robust operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, above our expectations, and working capital was a solid source of cash as we continued to manage inventory levels. We were also disciplined with CapEx, which came in at just over $350 million in the quarter, below last year's exit rate. During the quarter, we returned $171 million to shareholders via dividends. Our net leverage declined sequentially, coming below 4 times, driven by our improved profitability and strong cash generation. We ended Q1 with more than $3.7 billion of liquidity. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged. We are committed to building financial strength and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, and returning net leverage to at or below 2 times net debt to EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now, let's take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. Given the solid results in Q1, we have confidence that our financial performance in 2024 will improve versus last year. However, as it's still early in the new fiscal year and uncertainties remain, especially in our Beef segment, we have made only modest changes to our outlook. Our focus for fiscal 2024 remains to manage the business for profit and cash dollar generation, reflected in our guidance presented in dollar terms rather than margin percentages. With that in mind, we are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year-over-year. Moving to each of the segments. Prepared Foods had a solid start in a seasonally strong period. For the remainder of the year, we expect strong volume results as we continue our momentum in foodservice and see the benefits of our capacity additions. We remain focused on operational efficiencies while we support our brands and anticipate continued start-up costs. Taking all this into account, we're maintaining our AOI guidance to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. In Chicken, our operational turnaround is progressing as anticipated. For the remainder of the year, we expect to return to normal seasonality where Q2 is typically a weaker quarter. Given the strong start in Q1 and that we believe that there were more tailwinds than headwinds, we are tightening our AOI guidance range to be between $500 million and $700 million. In Beef, spreads are compressing as expected. However, uncertainty remains around how the cattle cycle will progress. Therefore, we are maintaining our full-year guidance at a loss of $400 million to breakeven. In Pork, on the back of our strong Q1 results, we're now raising our guidance to be between breakeven and $100 million. For the total company AOI, we're maintaining our guidance of between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, reflecting the portfolio nature of our segments. To round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million, and a tax rate to now be between 23% and 24%. Turning to CapEx, we're maintaining tight controls on spending in-line with profitability and cash flow, and we expect CapEx to remain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion this year. Finally, on free cash flow, we're committed to managing working capital and CapEx, and we're even more confident now than we were last quarter that we will generate positive free cash flow for the year. To further help model the shape of the rest of the year, we anticipate more typical seasonality across our business. As a reminder, Q2 is seasonally our weakest quarter for AOI and cash flow, driven by Beef and Chicken. As you may be aware, this January has already been impacted by severe winter weather disrupting operations. And again, we expect start-up costs in Prepared Foods to impact Q2 as well. So, in summary, 2024 is off to a promising start and we're cautiously optimistic on our prospects for the remainder of the year as well as for the long term. Tyson is a leader in the global protein industry. We have strong brands, a broad portfolio of products and a great team, all of which uniquely position us to win in the market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.\nSean Cornett: Thanks, John. We will now move on to your questions. Please recall that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply both to our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nDonnie King: Hi, Peter. Good morning.\nJohn R. Tyson: Good morning, Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Donnie, I was just wondering if you could give kind of maybe a brief state of the union, I know you gave some in your prepared remarks, but across the segments. And then maybe specifically, if you could start on Prepared Foods, where unlike a lot of CPG peers, you're showing actual volume growth. Some of that may be acquired, but just some of the dynamics around foodservice there seem to be a pretty important driver. So, if you can unpack that for us would be great.\nDonnie King: Sure. Thanks, Peter. I'll start off and maybe I'll have others to weigh in. Let me start off just kind of State of the Union. We had a solid first quarter and we continue to build on the momentum of the back half of 2023. We are seeing the benefits of our portfolio where Chicken and Pork improvements are offsetting challenges in Beef and where our Prepared Foods continues to deliver strong results. We continue to restore performance in our Chicken business. As I said earlier, this was our third consecutive quarter of $100 million of AOI improvement. And this -- our Chicken business remains a top priority of mine. We're managing Beef through the volatility and spread tightening of the cycle. We're making great progress in driving out the inefficiency all across the supply chain in Pork. Prepared Foods is performing to plan. While we have seen softness in the retail channel, our brands have performed well. Core brand share remains near-record levels and we're regaining share in our foodservice business, and I'll talk more about that in a moment. We're cautiously optimistic about FY '24. We have considered our better-than-expected results in this quarter. We've considered our initiatives to improve performance, while also still accounting for the ongoing macro uncertainty. As John said in his opening statement, Q2 is seasonally weaker and our Q2 started off -- has started off with several significant weather events. But, having said all that, taken together, it's still early in the year and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We have a lots of work ahead of us, and we're leaving no stone unturned. We're focused on CapEx and working capital to drive cash flow and support our dividend. We are controlling the controllables and taking necessary action, including right-sizing and modernizing our footprint and network design to drive efficiencies. We are pleased with the quarter and believe we're taking the right steps. We are excited about our future and are focused on creating value for our shareholders. Specifically -- or a little bit more specifically in terms of Prepared Foods, to your question, Peter, we had -- in the quarter, we had strong top- and bottom-line performance in the quarter, with meaningful sequential improvement versus Q4 of '23. If you look at the makeup of the volume, it was driven by a balanced portfolio between retail and foodservice. We're regaining some share lost in the middle of the pandemic that we couldn't support and we also had the acquisition from a volume standpoint of Williams sausage. Our branded core business line remained a key focus, and we have a competitive advantage with volume share near-record levels and 400 basis points above Q1 '19. Let me stop with that. Melanie, anything you would add to what I've said?\nMelanie Boulden: Yeah. Donnie, I think you did a great job I'm hitting the highlights. The only thing I'll add for you Peter is, as Donnie said, our foodservice performance was strong, and I believe you asked about this question. Our growth this quarter was up 3% and that was due to customer expansion. Look, as this channel is rebounding, it continues to be an important part of our portfolio that we are focused on because we want to be where our consumers are at. And so, we're diversifying our customer base, we're building digital capabilities to drive demand, and we are focused on profitable growth.\nPeter Galbo: Great. Thanks for all that. And then just maybe quickly as a follow-up on Beef, Donnie. Look, the cattle inventory report out last week seems like maybe we're nearing a bottom or seeing potentially some improvement. But just, what's the conversation like with ranchers at this point? Like what's it going to take to get them to actually start the heifer retention process? Because I think that remains kind of the biggest linchpin in the whole chain and it doesn't seem like we have a lot of clarity there yet. Thanks very much.\nDonnie King: Sure. I mean, I'll tell you we look at the same information that I'm sure you've seen and we saw the cattle on feed report that you referenced. Unfortunately, Peter, the data doesn't indicate that heifer retention is taking place and that's obviously one of the signposts we're looking for. In the quarter, we continue to see volatility and spread tightening. We expected that. As we think about our outlook, we continue to project high cattle supplies for the balance of 2024 and even beyond. And let me pause. Brady, do you want to add anything to that?\nBrady Stewart: Yeah. Thanks, Donnie. And Peter, that's a great question and one that we continually are studying. I think when you unpack that cattle on feed report, there's a few comments that obviously are lending itself to the numbers that we're seeing, and part of it's relative to some slower turnover that we've seen. We've seen placements for cattle on feed from some of the drought areas as well from a geographical perspective. And as you indicated, which is the spotlight of the conversation is, we have not seen significant heifer retention to-date and continue to see those heifers move into the cattle on feed report. So, continuing to focus on a few factors relative to heifer retention, obviously, how these interest rates that we see today relative to the difference or the delta today versus some of the cycles in the pack -- in the past is a highlight for us to continue to watch. And then, we'll continue to evaluate and understand how weather conditions are changed and lend themselves into a more favorable heifer retention strategy for these ranchers.\nPeter Galbo: Thanks very much.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Peter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDonnie King: Good morning, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: Good morning. So, maybe coming back to Chicken, and John, you gave some color in your prepared remarks, but hoping to expand on a little bit on just the profit drivers in the business in the quarter. There was $170 million of feed tailwind year-on-year, some offset with price. But can you walk through the year-on-year profit bridge in Chicken a little bit more closely? And I guess, apart from seasonality in the fiscal first quarter -- fiscal second quarter, excuse me, the first quarter would imply kind of tracking to at or above the high end of the segment profit guidance for the year. So, just want to make sure we're understanding kind of some of the moving pieces you're looking at for the balance of fiscal '24.\nJohn R. Tyson: Yeah, Adam, thanks for the question. And maybe let me give a few point that will help you shape our '24 outlook compared to '23. I think the first thing to point out is we talked about the network moves, operational performance improvement, we started to realize that, and the adjustment in our guidance range of taking the bottom end up by $100 million, roughly equivalent in-line with where we were ahead of expectations for the balance of the year -- or excuse me, where we were compared to expectations. Then, when I move through the balance of the year, I know one question is sometimes on investors' mind is, \"Hey, where is your return on sales guidance? How does that peaking, or not peaking?\" We've heard some questions about that. We're not going to return on sales guidance, but there's reasons to believe that our quarter three and quarter four could be around where we delivered the result in Q1, but frankly, it's probably premature to make any strong assertions around that. And then again, Q2, we had weather impacts across all of our segments. Chicken was not immune to that. And so, that's kind of the overall picture that we can give today based on the shape of the year. A couple of other things we're saying, we did talk about a couple of hundred million dollars in improvements on some previous earnings calls, thinking about the benefits we've realized from the network moves. We believe that we have achieved that. We have one facility still going core in Indiana. And when we close out that process, then we'll be nearly finished there. And then, there are some tailwinds from a market standpoint. I think last quarter Donnie was the one who said more tailwinds than headwinds. I think that sentiment prevails. As you know it's not just grain prices, but it is kind of the interplay between that and what chicken markets are doing and what's going on from a supply-demand standpoint to influence things. So, I think overall the $500 million to $700 million range, for a lot of those reasons, is our best estimate today of where we think the year will be. And, yeah, hopefully that gives you a little extra color. Wes, maybe you got something to add in there for Adam.\nWes Morris: Yeah, I had a couple of comments, Adam. We expect to realize our strategic change funding throughout the year. And specifically to your question on year-over-year, both grains and markets were both lower. So, we stayed focused on improving our fundamentals year-over-year, did have a little tailwind, but it's mostly the material change we made in our fundamentals. We improved our live performance, specifically hatch and livability. We have a very disciplined S&OP process that got really tight in Q1, and our sales are not only sold out position, but our forecast accuracy has allowed us to do a better job filling orders with material less working capital.\nAdam Samuelson: That's very helpful color. And then just as a follow-up, especially in Chicken and Prepared Foods. Just wondering if you have any views on changes in consumer behavior and how consumer demand elasticity has been evolving as you kind of enter -- as the calendar flipped and how you're thinking about the state of the US consumer over the balance of calendar '24.\nMelanie Boulden: Thanks, Adam. So, I'll start first to talk about how we're looking at it from a Prepared Foods perspective and our Branded portfolio. So generally, we're seeing elasticities returning to pre-COVID levels. And as you know, we seek to balance both price and volume growth to maximize the value of our Branded portfolio. But at the end of the day, we do understand the financial uncertainty that our consumers are faced with as inflation remains elevated, which is why we continue to leverage our strong revenue growth management capabilities in support of our brands, and we're prioritizing their health and their profitability when determining our pricing strategy. And additionally, across the board for any of our Branded business, we remain focused on understanding our category dynamics, assessing our competition and, of course, meeting our consumer needs when making pricing decisions.\nWes Morris: Yes, Adam, I'd just add that we're seeing really good dark meat demand. We've seen a reemergence of our wing demand, and we're seeing a slight shift towards foodservice.\nAdam Samuelson: All right. That's all really helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to ask a little bit about competition on the Prepared Food side. Are there any of your more important categories that you're starting to feel maybe a little incremental pressure in terms of competition, whether it's on the pricing side or however you want to frame it? And I guess, how comfortable are you with your price gaps versus these competitors today just in a general sense?\nDonnie King: So, in terms of competition, I mean, regardless of the business, I mean there's -- we have some very strong competitors in every space that we play. And so, I'll leave that there. But I'll give Melanie the opportunity to talk about more specifics in categories. For example, I would just simply say that we saw a strong performance in breakfast sausage and cocktails, and we had some headwinds in our lunch meat and our frozen protein breakfast area. Melanie, do you want to add to that?\nMelanie Boulden: Yeah. I would just say, Ken, at the end of the day, this is a challenging consumer environment, and boy, competition is stepping up. We're not only seeing competition step up from branded players, but also private label is a factor. And I think overall, we're doing very well and holding our position. But at the end of the day, we are just focused on our own retail business, in particular, and making sure that we're doing what we have to drive consumption, to address any price gaps and make sure that we are maintaining our leadership position in -- which, as you know, in eight of our 10 categories. So right now, we are focused on making sure that we grow through high ROI merchandising with a strong feature and display at shelf. We're increasing our MAP investment to continue to grow our household penetration. We've got strong innovation on shelf now and also coming, which is going to offer strong engagement with consumers. And very importantly, to address pricing, we're making sure that we're enhancing our price pack architecture offering so we can ensure that we are maximizing our distribution footprint. And we think all these steps together, we're starting to see actions in the marketplace and are confident in our full-year outlook.\nKen Goldman: Thank you for that. And then, a follow-up is on Chicken. As we look at some of the export data, and I realize some of the monthly data is a couple of months in arrears usually. But the export data in general in terms of pounds for chicken, they've been a little bit weaker as 2023 anyway, progressed. And yet as we start into 2024, at least according to Urner Barry, leg quarter prices have done pretty well, which might be not what one might expect at first glance is seeing the trade number. So, just curious for a little bit of your thoughts on how to think about like demand for leg quarters, export demand in general. Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nWes Morris: Yeah, I'll take that, Ken. Thanks. We've seen a lot of disruption in the [part] (ph) export side. Specific to leg quarters, freezer stocks are at a really low level and demand seems to be robust enough to clear it at very attractive prices.\nKen Goldman: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nBen Bienvenu: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.\nDonnie King: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu: I want to ask -- I know, Chicken has gotten a lot of focus, congrats on the quarterly results. John, I wanted to drill down on the 2Q commentary that you provided, recognizing it sounds like there's some operational headwinds and disruptions from weather early in the year. What I'm curious on is if fundamental -- commodity fundamentals continue to improve and grain prices stay low, supply/demand comes into better balance, is that enough positive to offset the temporal operational dynamics that we saw in the second quarter?\nJohn R. Tyson: I think there are reasons to believe why some of that could offset it. But I think it would be -- I think, to quantify exactly what that offset is, we're not really ready to do that. But let's zoom out and talk about the broader year, because I think I just want to hone in on some factors that are at play about why we remain cautious on the Chicken outlook. And it has to do with what's going on in the total protein markets. Beef continues to be volatile. I think we've had predictions about where beef prices and beef markets were going to go, some have held through, some have not. There is projections for more pork to be on the market this year. We've already talked about the consumer today. So, I just want to make sure that we land the message today while there -- we're cautiously optimistic about chicken, there remains a lot of uncertainty and a lot of time left in the year. So, Ben, I think I addressed at least parts of your question. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nBen Bienvenu: That's great. Sorry.\nDonnie King: If I could add one thing or a couple of things to that as it relates to Chicken. Those operational improvements that all of us have talked about in Chicken, those continue. And those fundamentals, while we are improved, there's still a lot of work left to do there. And we got a really good team working against those things. But keep that in mind as you are looking at Q2 and the balance of the year as well.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Very good. Thinking about the cash flow statement, John Randal, you guys came into fiscal '24, bringing down your CapEx budget materially. You've sustained the range again this quarter. Is there yet still room to tighten that budget as we move through the year, or do you think that number is more set in stone with potentially improvements coming into 2025?\nJohn R. Tyson: That's a great question. I think there's probably room to tighten it a little bit, but let me kind of talk about the total picture. When we gave guidance in the first quarter, we talked about striving to be free cash flow positive that we would pay attention to our ability to manage the business and working capital as well as our operational results, and that would influence our thinking in terms of the total spend. If you just extrapolate where we are in Q1, that would take you towards a higher end of that $1.5 billion range. But that's really just a product of lot of good projects in flight that we have, our efforts to slow down from the spin that was projected in north of $2 billion in recent years. And I would just say we're not trending to that higher end because, \"Hey, we've made some adjustment in our opening up the capital floodgates again,\" we remain very committed to getting that spend down to the midpoint of our range or below as we move through the balance of this year and next year. So that's what I want you to take away from a CapEx guidance standpoint.\nBen Bienvenu: Great. Thanks so much.\nDonnie King: Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is actually on the Pork segment and the outlook there. If I look at the performance in the quarter, and it seems like some solid performance is probably continuing into the second quarter. It doesn't seem like there's much baked into the back part of the year. So I guess, how are you thinking about pork margins from here evolving through the year and kind of the puts and takes as we get into the back part of the year?\nDonnie King: Let me start off, and then I will flip it to Brady to talk about Pork. Hog supply drove lower hog costs, leading to improved spreads. We're seeing a number of benefits of better execution in Pork, and we have assembled a really, really strong team in our Pork business led by Kyle Narron. He and his team have really taken out inefficiencies from procurement all the way to the customer, consumer, and very proud of that work. But I would also tell you there's still room for more. And you will probably continue to hear that from us is there's -- every time -- excuse me, every time we turn over a rock, we find something else, but where our moat is one of continual improvement. And Brady, any big nuggets that I have not touched on?\nBrady Stewart: No. Thanks, Donnie. And Q1, obviously, is seasonally the strongest quarter of the year. And we'd expect to see some typical seasonality as we move through specifically the latter part of this year as well. The team understands it's their responsibility to control the controllables. And as Donnie indicated, done a really good job of being able to take advantage of some of the spreads we have seen in Q1 and certainly expect those improvements to continue through the course of the year as well. Really seeing some increased operational efficiencies, and the team has done a great job increasing the true business performance through the data and analytics platforms that they've stood up that allow us for better decision-making and really adaptation of some of these market trends in the current conditions.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, on the Beef side, I guess, when I look at the typical seasonality and I look at kind of the performance in the first quarter and then the commentary around the second quarter, it seems like you would need to have pretty solid improvement in the back part of the year, not to be kind of towards the lower end of that range. I know there's seasonality involved there as well. I guess I'm just curious, can you talk about maybe what would get you to the high and low end of that range? I understand certainly that there's a lot of uncertainty as we move through the year. And then, maybe can you clarify also when we think about the second quarter, are you thinking about sequentially lower off the number that you reported adjusted operating income in the first quarter, or is that kind of once you back out the inventory adjustment? Thanks.\nBrady Stewart: Well, thanks for the question. And as you pointed out there, I think it's really important to emphasize what both John and Donnie indicated in the opening remarks, which was, in Q1, we saw that rapid decline in cattle futures and that was the driver for that inventory valuation adjustment, that was roughly $56 million in the first quarter. And really, as we look at the first quarter, obviously, we saw some headwinds relative to some decreased value in the drop. We saw the spread compression. And obviously, with lower supply, not only in Q1, but as we move through the rest of the year, we see that lower opportunity for cost dilution of our overhead structure relative to these volumes. But let me be really clear, we see a path to improvement as well. And from an operational excellence perspective, how we manage the business today versus the past in a different economic cycle is very important. Focus on efficiency, yield and really balancing supply and demand, not only by a cut-by-cut basis and through our grinds complex, but also in terms of yield and efficiency is going to be paramount and important to the team, and they're dialed in on that as well. We've made changes that certainly provide us opportunity in the future as well as we mentioned last quarter. We've right-sized our Beef value-added business really to match our customer needs and what we're seeing from a supply perspective as we move through this. And again, as I've mentioned before, we have a well-capitalized asset base, and believe we're really able to manage through a variety of headwinds and market conditions that we expect to see as we move through this cattle cycle.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.\nDonnie King: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Theurer with Bank of America -- excuse me, with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBen Theurer: Hi, good morning, Donnie, John. Thanks for taking my question.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nBen Theurer: So, just wanted to kind of understand a little bit some of the dynamics as it relates to the export business, because if I remember right, that used to be some sort of a headwind also in Beef. So, if we look into the details on sales into the international channels, particularly Beef, which kind of contrary to the rest of it, was actually even down in the sales. Could you elaborate a little bit on the dynamics in the export markets as it relates to Beef in particular, but also if you could just mention briefly what you're seeing on exports for Chicken and Pork? That would be my first question. Thank you.\nBrady Stewart: Sure. Well, thank you for the question. And I think it's really important to understand, we've really been working within historically high rates from a beef product or cut-out perspective. And when we talk about the arbitrage opportunity between a domestic sale and an export sale, really puts the domestic beef business and industry at a disadvantage right now. We're seeing large supplies from some of our competing countries that are in the southern hemisphere. And they're really on the opposite side of the cycle from we are -- from where we are. And so that's really led to increased opportunity for some of those competing countries and a decreased opportunity for us here in the U.S. However, we have seen strong domestic beef demand has led the -- held these cut-out values at a historically high level as well.\nWes Morris: Yeah. And Ben, this is Wes. I'll touch briefly on Chicken. As I said earlier, parts have been interrupted due to [indiscernible]. And on leg quarters, we're seeing frozen inventory in the US at almost record lows. Our inventory continues to be in check, and the pricing has been very good going forward.\nBen Theurer: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. And then just quickly following up as it relates to the Prepared Foods business. Can you quantify what the Williams sausage volume contribution was? Because I didn't find that. I know it was positive, but if you could quantify that, that would be helpful.\nBrady Stewart: Yeah. We haven't broken that out, but it's -- we haven't broken that out specifically, Ben.\nBen Theurer: Okay. That's okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTom Palmer: Good morning, and thanks for the question. Maybe I could ask on feed costs. Just how locked in is your exposure this year? And then, when you look at the downward moves over the past few months, does this benefit your current fiscal year? Or if it continues, is this more of a 2025 flow-through? Because it does seem like there's some incremental favorability.\nWes Morris: Yeah, Tom, this is Wes. I'll touch on that. We have a very diverse commodity risk management group. We also have different pricing mechanisms with customers in which some of the grains flow-through through pricing. I would tell you it's moderate and in the back half of the year.\nTom Palmer: Okay. Thank you. And then, I wanted to follow up on the Prepared Food side, maybe going back to Peter Galbo's question just on the new customer wins. Are there particular products that you're seeing these wins greatest in or particular channels within foodservice? Thanks.\nDonnie King: Melanie?\nMelanie Boulden: So Tom, your question was -- I just want to make sure I'm clear. Are we -- are there particular products where you are seeing more success? Can you just repeat your question for me?\nTom Palmer: Yes. Sorry. Exactly. Just you've noted some -- your growth was driven by some new customer wins. And I was just curious what products were really driving that for you right now within Prepared Foods. Thanks.\nMelanie Boulden: Yeah. So, I'd say that when I was talking about the customer expansion, we are making great strides in that area on the foodservice side of the business. And then, I would say, on the retail side of the business, we're seeing strong growth in distribution with our existing customers behind our core business lines, but we're also seeing excitement behind some of our -- a lot of our new innovation. And in particular, I want to highlight our Jimmy Dean Maple Griddle Cake that we launched last year to success, and we are planning in a couple of months to launch an extension of that product item. Does that help, Tom?\nTom Palmer: Yes. Thank you.\nDonnie King: Tom, let me add a little more color as it relates to foodservice there. As a reminder to everyone, in the middle of the pandemic, we had some operational issues being able to produce enough product for our customers, and we essentially had to give up some business. And we've been, since the pandemic, trying to go and regain that. But we have a nice diversification between what are the traditionally quick-service restaurants and as well as broad line distribution.\nTom Palmer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: I want to come back to Chicken and just trying to understand, obviously, the lift in the quarter was cost and margin driven. But when you point to the strategic actions and those benefits, can you help us understand maybe how to think of them kind of longer term? And would this put you at the higher end or above kind of a 5% to 7% margin range? I know you're not wanting to think about margins as how you guide for the year. You gave a little bit of breadcrumbs for the second half. That's all real helpful. But maybe just looking a little further out, is business structurally different enough that under normalized conditions, you would rethink what it's capable of, what its earnings power is longer term?\nDonnie King: So, let me start. This is Donnie. Let me start with a couple of points, and then I think John probably has a couple to add. But in terms of being prepared to give guidance, we're not prepared to do that today and talk about that. But what I can tell you is what we're doing as a company. We talked about the third consecutive quarter of over $100 million of AOI improvement. In the midst of that, what I can also tell you is market that's for grain or the meat side, those were largely offsetting one another. So, the improvements are coming from operational improvements, operational excellence both in plants and in live production and really driving out waste from the business. But we also, as we said earlier, we're realizing the benefits from plant closures that in terms of modernizing and right-sizing our footprint. So, we're seeing all of those. But this plan doesn't really is -- I mean, we've modeled the markets as they are today for the balance of the year, but this is all about operational excellence, and being more competitive and being better at what we do, at the same time driving up raw material to a more value-added and branded within the Chicken segment. John?\nJohn R. Tyson: Yeah, Don, it's a nice summary. I think, again, without touching on what the long-term outlook is like, the things I would point out about how the strategic moves we made have a sustaining impact in our business is a couple of things. First, we're just taking cost out of the system while still keeping the same amount of volume with our customers. Over the long run, that means not putting capital into older and more tired assets, rather investing in those assets where we think we could achieve our targeted ROIC number. And then, I think the other thing, too, is we have really, in the last year, refocused our growth to be demand backed and to be in those subcategory within the Chicken segment, where we see favorable trends from a growth and margin standpoint. So, I think with that over the long run, we project to be competing and performing as a best-in-class chicken company from a margin standpoint, and that's how we realize that. I think the other big move that we made, we've seen it in our live performance results this year is the switch from NAE to NAIHM and that provides us for a lot more consistency in order to meet customer demand and expectations from a live standpoint.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. Great. And just a follow-up on Prepared Foods. I understand it's obviously always competitive, and you touched on some of those dynamics. But can you give a sense on promotional levels? Would you say they're normalized again? Do you see increasing activity there? You called out some of the mix headwinds was priced otherwise flat? Or I guess maybe could you dissect the price and mix pieces of that, and just a sense of how the environment looks from a promotional perspective? Is it getting more intense, or does it seem to have stabilized? What's your sense of how that looks?\nMelanie Boulden: Yeah. So, this is Melanie. I would say that promotional activity is continuing -- we are continuing to see intense promotional activity. In terms of how we are operating, we have our highest-performing our highest-ROI merchandising initiatives in place to drive our feature and display and choice at shelf, and we are seeing it working. But to your point, competitive activity in this area is strong and we're just focused on controlling our controllables. And in addition to our promotional activity, we're focused on, as I said before, increasing our MAP investment to engage consumers. Again, we've got strong innovation in place, and we're enhancing -- when you asked about price, we're making sure that we enhance our price pack architecture structure to address competitive pricing as well.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nDonnie King: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nDonnie King: Good morning.\nJohn R. Tyson: Good morning, Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. So two ones. Firstly, on the financial side. Your leverage has obviously come down, but it sounds as though weather -- there'll be more sequential improvement in operating income next quarter in CBD given the weather issues. Do you expect leverage to continue to come down from here, or could next week -- next quarter be the high point?\nJohn R. Tyson: Yeah. Thanks, Alexia. So, I think two questions in there. The first off is just independent of weather -- I want to make sure we're tracking. Independent of weather, we expect our Q2 to typically be one of the softer quarters from an operating income standpoint. And so then that's exacerbated by weather a little bit. In the long run, we are projecting for leverage to continue to come down. That's driven by a couple of things. One, we're getting more efficient with working capital. We've talked about some inventory clearing in our -- around our segments. Exactly kind of where things happen in the first half of the year, we can say that we would expect to end our fiscal 2024 in a better net leverage position from a ratio standpoint than last year. That's evident also in our pull down on CapEx and what we projected, which is to be a better year from an operating income and EBITDA standpoint than '23. So that's -- we're trending in the right direction, aggressively pursuing that at or around 2 times net leverage ratio. And we would project that we'll get to do that, continue to invest in our business and also support our dividend from a capital allocation standpoint.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, sticking with Prepared Foods, it sounds as though this mix shift into foodservice is obviously a good thing overall, but it is pushing the pricing down and potentially there might be a negative mix shift with margins. Are you able to clarify whether that price pressure will continue in future quarters? And are you able to talk about the margin differential between branded retail and foodservice and private label, which I assume is lower?\nDonnie King: Okay. Alexia, this is Don. There are a lot of questions in there. Here's what I can tell you relative to foodservice. And keep this in mind, we've talked about it today because you have seen some volume improvement relative to foodservice. I would remind you that we had given up some business in the middle of pandemic, and the nature of those contracts can be quite lengthy. And we're starting to get back in when those open up and get some volume. We have maintained in Prepared Foods the capacity which produces those products. So, if you think about it from that perspective, this overhead in these assets have been a drag on our business to some degree. We've gotten new volume to put into those assets. So that's one piece of it. We're probably not going to talk about the differential in the margin structure between foodservice and retail. But it's important that we regain that volume in foodservice. But our retail -- our iconic brands in retail continuing to support those and grow those and innovate and do merchandising like Melanie has talked about before, those are all still critical -- mission critical for us.\nMelanie Boulden: Yeah. And the only thing, Alexia, I would like to add, because I think Donnie did a nice job of highlighting more of the top-line, but also as we think about our business and our performance, one of the reasons that we were able to deliver a solid quarter and what we plan on continuing to do is focus on our controllables, the things we can control, especially from an operational efficiency standpoint. So, we're really focused on improving our service levels, maximizing our asset utilization by driving down our overhead and increasing our yield and labor efficiencies. And importantly, we're driving automation to improve our supply chain execution. So, from a top-line perspective, yes, your question was about mix, but I just wanted to reiterate that we're also working all levers of the P&L to ensure that we drive strong bottom-line as well.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.\nJohn R. Tyson: Before Donnie wraps us up, I just want to make sure we land one final point related to our outlook for 2024. And we've had a lot of great discussion this morning about our various segments. We obviously moved the range on Chicken and on Pork. But I just want to highlight our reaffirmation of the total company guidance from $1 billion to $1.5 billion based on a lot of various macro factors and the interplay between all of our segments. I think we have reasons to believe while we could achieve a range of outcomes in that window, the midpoint plus or minus, we designed it that way for a reason, and it feels like a way to think about the total look. And then obviously, as we move through Q2 and through the balance of the year, we'll give any revisions as necessary. But cautiously optimistic, promising start to the year, but still a lot of factors at play around total protein availability, consumer sentiment and the other unpredictable factors that would get us to where we are. So, Donnie, I think with that, I hand it over to you.\nDonnie King: Okay. I want to say -- once again, say thank you to all 139,000 of our team members. We're here today and have a good story to tell because of those 139,000 team members who contribute to us each and every day. Their efforts are what makes and what drives this business forward. Our strategy is working. We have the right leadership team in place to deliver, and we're poised to drive long-term opportunity and shareholder value. We've taken some steps in the right direction, but we have a lot of work to do. Thanks for your continued interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John R. Tyson",
            "content": "Thanks, Donnie. I'll start with an overview of our total company results before moving on to our individual segments. Sales in Q1 grew slightly year-over-year as an increase in Beef revenue was nearly offset by a decrease in Chicken. The decline in adjusted operating profit was driven by lower profitability in Beef, which was partially offset by growth in Chicken and Pork. It's important to note that AOI improved significantly on a sequential basis despite the modest decline versus last year. Adjusted EPS nearly doubled compared to last quarter, highlighting the ongoing improvement in our operational performance. Now, let's review our segment results starting with Prepared Foods. In Prepared Foods, Q1 revenue was flat year-over-year. Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition and continued recovery in our foodservice business. Lower pricing primarily reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q1 was also in-line with last year. Lower raw material costs and operational efficiencies were offset by increased brand support expenses, start-up costs associated with new capacity additions and mix. AOI dollars and margin both increased significantly on a sequential basis due to strong operational performance and great seasonal execution by the team. Moving on to Chicken. Sales in Q1 declined 5.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of lower commodity protein prices. Volume declined 1.5% due to lower production, which was partially offset by continued sell-through of finished goods inventory. Despite the decline in sales versus last year, AOI more than doubled in Q1, primarily driven by the benefits of our strategic actions and other operational efficiencies. These include lower plant spend, improved yield and better live performance. While input costs were a clear tailwind, these were largely offset by the impact of lower pricing. As Donnie mentioned, this is the third consecutive quarter of more than $100 million of AOI improvement as we were able to pull forward the benefits of closures of inefficient plants in improvements in our live operations. Now moving to Beef. In Beef, revenue increased 6.4% year-over-year in Q1, with lower head throughput more than offset by higher prices per pound. While revenue increased, AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads, as was expected. As Donnie mentioned, in Q1, nearly half of the operating loss was driven by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily due to the rapid and significant decline in cattle futures. Moving to Pork, Q1 revenue was down modestly as volume growth was offset by lower pricing. However, AOI increased year-over-year, benefiting primarily from improved spreads driven by lower hog cost as well as better execution. And finally, a brief comment on our International business. AOI improved as we begin to lap some of the start-up cost of our newer facilities and continue to focus on improving execution despite a decline in sales, driven by macroeconomic challenges. Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation. Our commitment to building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders, primarily via our dividend, remains unwavering. While market conditions remain challenging, we are laser-focused on disciplined management and deployment our capital resources to drive cash flow. Q1 showcased robust operating cash flow of $1.3 billion, above our expectations, and working capital was a solid source of cash as we continued to manage inventory levels. We were also disciplined with CapEx, which came in at just over $350 million in the quarter, below last year's exit rate. During the quarter, we returned $171 million to shareholders via dividends. Our net leverage declined sequentially, coming below 4 times, driven by our improved profitability and strong cash generation. We ended Q1 with more than $3.7 billion of liquidity. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged. We are committed to building financial strength and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, and returning net leverage to at or below 2 times net debt to EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value. Now, let's take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. Given the solid results in Q1, we have confidence that our financial performance in 2024 will improve versus last year. However, as it's still early in the new fiscal year and uncertainties remain, especially in our Beef segment, we have made only modest changes to our outlook. Our focus for fiscal 2024 remains to manage the business for profit and cash dollar generation, reflected in our guidance presented in dollar terms rather than margin percentages. With that in mind, we are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year-over-year. Moving to each of the segments. Prepared Foods had a solid start in a seasonally strong period. For the remainder of the year, we expect strong volume results as we continue our momentum in foodservice and see the benefits of our capacity additions. We remain focused on operational efficiencies while we support our brands and anticipate continued start-up costs. Taking all this into account, we're maintaining our AOI guidance to be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. In Chicken, our operational turnaround is progressing as anticipated. For the remainder of the year, we expect to return to normal seasonality where Q2 is typically a weaker quarter. Given the strong start in Q1 and that we believe that there were more tailwinds than headwinds, we are tightening our AOI guidance range to be between $500 million and $700 million. In Beef, spreads are compressing as expected. However, uncertainty remains around how the cattle cycle will progress. Therefore, we are maintaining our full-year guidance at a loss of $400 million to breakeven. In Pork, on the back of our strong Q1 results, we're now raising our guidance to be between breakeven and $100 million. For the total company AOI, we're maintaining our guidance of between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, reflecting the portfolio nature of our segments. To round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million, and a tax rate to now be between 23% and 24%. Turning to CapEx, we're maintaining tight controls on spending in-line with profitability and cash flow, and we expect CapEx to remain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion this year. Finally, on free cash flow, we're committed to managing working capital and CapEx, and we're even more confident now than we were last quarter that we will generate positive free cash flow for the year. To further help model the shape of the rest of the year, we anticipate more typical seasonality across our business. As a reminder, Q2 is seasonally our weakest quarter for AOI and cash flow, driven by Beef and Chicken. As you may be aware, this January has already been impacted by severe winter weather disrupting operations. And again, we expect start-up costs in Prepared Foods to impact Q2 as well. So, in summary, 2024 is off to a promising start and we're cautiously optimistic on our prospects for the remainder of the year as well as for the long term. Tyson is a leader in the global protein industry. We have strong brands, a broad portfolio of products and a great team, all of which uniquely position us to win in the market. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions. Good morning, Peter. Yeah, Adam, thanks for the question. And maybe let me give a few point that will help you shape our '24 outlook compared to '23. I think the first thing to point out is we talked about the network moves, operational performance improvement, we started to realize that, and the adjustment in our guidance range of taking the bottom end up by $100 million, roughly equivalent in-line with where we were ahead of expectations for the balance of the year -- or excuse me, where we were compared to expectations. Then, when I move through the balance of the year, I know one question is sometimes on investors' mind is, \"Hey, where is your return on sales guidance? How does that peaking, or not peaking?\" We've heard some questions about that. We're not going to return on sales guidance, but there's reasons to believe that our quarter three and quarter four could be around where we delivered the result in Q1, but frankly, it's probably premature to make any strong assertions around that. And then again, Q2, we had weather impacts across all of our segments. Chicken was not immune to that. And so, that's kind of the overall picture that we can give today based on the shape of the year. A couple of other things we're saying, we did talk about a couple of hundred million dollars in improvements on some previous earnings calls, thinking about the benefits we've realized from the network moves. We believe that we have achieved that. We have one facility still going core in Indiana. And when we close out that process, then we'll be nearly finished there. And then, there are some tailwinds from a market standpoint. I think last quarter Donnie was the one who said more tailwinds than headwinds. I think that sentiment prevails. As you know it's not just grain prices, but it is kind of the interplay between that and what chicken markets are doing and what's going on from a supply-demand standpoint to influence things. So, I think overall the $500 million to $700 million range, for a lot of those reasons, is our best estimate today of where we think the year will be. And, yeah, hopefully that gives you a little extra color. Wes, maybe you got something to add in there for Adam. I think there are reasons to believe why some of that could offset it. But I think it would be -- I think, to quantify exactly what that offset is, we're not really ready to do that. But let's zoom out and talk about the broader year, because I think I just want to hone in on some factors that are at play about why we remain cautious on the Chicken outlook. And it has to do with what's going on in the total protein markets. Beef continues to be volatile. I think we've had predictions about where beef prices and beef markets were going to go, some have held through, some have not. There is projections for more pork to be on the market this year. We've already talked about the consumer today. So, I just want to make sure that we land the message today while there -- we're cautiously optimistic about chicken, there remains a lot of uncertainty and a lot of time left in the year. So, Ben, I think I addressed at least parts of your question. Hopefully, that's helpful. That's a great question. I think there's probably room to tighten it a little bit, but let me kind of talk about the total picture. When we gave guidance in the first quarter, we talked about striving to be free cash flow positive that we would pay attention to our ability to manage the business and working capital as well as our operational results, and that would influence our thinking in terms of the total spend. If you just extrapolate where we are in Q1, that would take you towards a higher end of that $1.5 billion range. But that's really just a product of lot of good projects in flight that we have, our efforts to slow down from the spin that was projected in north of $2 billion in recent years. And I would just say we're not trending to that higher end because, \"Hey, we've made some adjustment in our opening up the capital floodgates again,\" we remain very committed to getting that spend down to the midpoint of our range or below as we move through the balance of this year and next year. So that's what I want you to take away from a CapEx guidance standpoint. Yeah, Don, it's a nice summary. I think, again, without touching on what the long-term outlook is like, the things I would point out about how the strategic moves we made have a sustaining impact in our business is a couple of things. First, we're just taking cost out of the system while still keeping the same amount of volume with our customers. Over the long run, that means not putting capital into older and more tired assets, rather investing in those assets where we think we could achieve our targeted ROIC number. And then, I think the other thing, too, is we have really, in the last year, refocused our growth to be demand backed and to be in those subcategory within the Chicken segment, where we see favorable trends from a growth and margin standpoint. So, I think with that over the long run, we project to be competing and performing as a best-in-class chicken company from a margin standpoint, and that's how we realize that. I think the other big move that we made, we've seen it in our live performance results this year is the switch from NAE to NAIHM and that provides us for a lot more consistency in order to meet customer demand and expectations from a live standpoint. Good morning, Alexia. Yeah. Thanks, Alexia. So, I think two questions in there. The first off is just independent of weather -- I want to make sure we're tracking. Independent of weather, we expect our Q2 to typically be one of the softer quarters from an operating income standpoint. And so then that's exacerbated by weather a little bit. In the long run, we are projecting for leverage to continue to come down. That's driven by a couple of things. One, we're getting more efficient with working capital. We've talked about some inventory clearing in our -- around our segments. Exactly kind of where things happen in the first half of the year, we can say that we would expect to end our fiscal 2024 in a better net leverage position from a ratio standpoint than last year. That's evident also in our pull down on CapEx and what we projected, which is to be a better year from an operating income and EBITDA standpoint than '23. So that's -- we're trending in the right direction, aggressively pursuing that at or around 2 times net leverage ratio. And we would project that we'll get to do that, continue to invest in our business and also support our dividend from a capital allocation standpoint. Before Donnie wraps us up, I just want to make sure we land one final point related to our outlook for 2024. And we've had a lot of great discussion this morning about our various segments. We obviously moved the range on Chicken and on Pork. But I just want to highlight our reaffirmation of the total company guidance from $1 billion to $1.5 billion based on a lot of various macro factors and the interplay between all of our segments.

            "name": "Melanie Boulden",
            "content": "Yeah. Donnie, I think you did a great job I'm hitting the highlights. The only thing I'll add for you Peter is, as Donnie said, our foodservice performance was strong, and I believe you asked about this question. Our growth this quarter was up 3% and that was due to customer expansion. Look, as this channel is rebounding, it continues to be an important part of our portfolio that we are focused on because we want to be where our consumers are at. And so, we're diversifying our customer base, we're building digital capabilities to drive demand, and we are focused on profitable growth. Thanks, Adam. So, I'll start first to talk about how we're looking at it from a Prepared Foods perspective and our Branded portfolio. So generally, we're seeing elasticities returning to pre-COVID levels. And as you know, we seek to balance both price and volume growth to maximize the value of our Branded portfolio. But at the end of the day, we do understand the financial uncertainty that our consumers are faced with as inflation remains elevated, which is why we continue to leverage our strong revenue growth management capabilities in support of our brands, and we're prioritizing their health and their profitability when determining our pricing strategy. And additionally, across the board for any of our Branded business, we remain focused on understanding our category dynamics, assessing our competition and, of course, meeting our consumer needs when making pricing decisions. Yeah. I would just say, Ken, at the end of the day, this is a challenging consumer environment, and boy, competition is stepping up. We're not only seeing competition step up from branded players, but also private label is a factor. And I think overall, we're doing very well and holding our position. But at the end of the day, we are just focused on our own retail business, in particular, and making sure that we're doing what we have to drive consumption, to address any price gaps and make sure that we are maintaining our leadership position in -- which, as you know, in eight of our 10 categories. So right now, we are focused on making sure that we grow through high ROI merchandising with a strong feature and display at shelf. We're increasing our MAP investment to continue to grow our household penetration. We've got strong innovation on shelf now and also coming, which is going to offer strong engagement with consumers. And very importantly, to address pricing, we're making sure that we're enhancing our price pack architecture offering so we can ensure that we are maximizing our distribution footprint. And we think all these steps together, we're starting to see actions in the marketplace and are confident in our full-year outlook. So Tom, your question was -- I just want to make sure I'm clear. Are we -- are there particular products where you are seeing more success? Can you just repeat your question for me? Yeah. So, I'd say that when I was talking about the customer expansion, we are making great strides in that area on the foodservice side of the business. And then, I would say, on the retail side of the business, we're seeing strong growth in distribution with our existing customers behind our core business lines, but we're also seeing excitement behind some of our -- a lot of our new innovation. And in particular, I want to highlight our Jimmy Dean Maple Griddle Cake that we launched last year to success, and we are planning in a couple of months to launch an extension of that product item. Does that help, Tom? Yeah. So, this is Melanie. I would say that promotional activity is continuing -- we are continuing to see intense promotional activity. In terms of how we are operating, we have our highest-performing our highest-ROI merchandising initiatives in place to drive our feature and display and choice at shelf, and we are seeing it working. But to your point, competitive activity in this area is strong and we're just focused on controlling our controllables. And in addition to our promotional activity, we're focused on, as I said before, increasing our MAP investment to engage consumers. Again, we've got strong innovation in place, and we're enhancing -- when you asked about price, we're making sure that we enhance our price pack architecture structure to address competitive pricing as well. Yeah. And the only thing, Alexia, I would like to add, because I think Donnie did a nice job of highlighting more of the top-line, but also as we think about our business and our performance, one of the reasons that we were able to deliver a solid quarter and what we plan on continuing to do is focus on our controllables, the things we can control, especially from an operational efficiency standpoint. So, we're really focused on improving our service levels, maximizing our asset utilization by driving down our overhead and increasing our yield and labor efficiencies. And importantly, we're driving automation to improve our supply chain execution. So, from a top-line perspective, yes, your question was about mix, but I just wanted to reiterate that we're also working all levers of the P&L to ensure that we drive strong bottom-line as well."

            "name": "Donnie King",
            "content": "Thanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, fiscal 2024 is off to a good start with solid performance in Q1 giving us confidence in our full-year outlook. The momentum we established in the back half of last year continued in Q1, highlighted by a $175 million improvement in adjusted operating income, a 130 basis points of AOI margin expansion and near doubling of adjusted EPS, all on a sequential basis. As we begin fiscal '24, we're witnessing the benefits of our core multi-protein portfolio. Chicken and Pork are offsetting Beef headwinds, while Prepared Foods continues to generate strong profit dollars and margins. While we can't control the macro environment, our focus on what we can control has been evident in Q1. Our performance reflects a commitment to operational excellence, we are more agile, collaborative, and disciplined business than a year ago, and we have a long runway of opportunities in front of us. I'm proud of our team members' continued efforts to enhance operational performance and want to thank all of them for their high level of engagement and their part in delivering our results in this quarter. We're controlling what we can to drive cash flow as well. Our disciplined approach to CapEx and working capital helped generate strong cash flow in the quarter. Prudent cash deployment is part of our strategy to build financial strength and will position us well when market dynamics turn in our favor. You've seen us take bold actions to improve performance, and everything remains on the table to drive operational excellence and address inefficiencies. Our plan is working, and we're seeing tangible benefits of our efforts as evidenced by improvements in Chicken and Pork. While I'm pleased by the performance in Q1, we still have more work ahead of us, and we're cautiously optimistic and laser-focused on achieving what we set out to do this year. Our brands resonate with consumers, and we're maintaining strong market share despite comparing to our record position last year and some overall category consumption softness in Q1. We will continue to support our brands through innovation, marketing, and strong customer partnerships while meeting consumers where they are. I remain highly confident in our long-term strategy based on a broad portfolio of core proteins and strong brands and I'm optimistic about our future. We're leaving no stone unturned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let's delve into an update on share position of our branded portfolio. Our Q1 pound share in our core business lines, which include product lines from our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, State Fair, Aidells, and Ball Park, remains at historically high levels despite a modest decline compared to record share in Q1 last year. In fact, our core business lines have grown pound share by more than 400 basis points since Q1 of 2019. While inflation is easing, consumers are still facing high prices compared to two years ago. However, they are still willing to purchase brands they know and trust, and this is reflected in our share. We're also focused on customer elasticity and balancing with our own cost. We believe our approach is working. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonate strongly with consumers. Over the past year, nearly three out of four US households purchased a Tyson core business line product, and this penetration rate is growing. What gets me even more excited is that our product line with the highest penetration rate is only in about a third of households, leaving us plenty of room for continued growth over the long run. Moving on to segment performance, starting with Prepared Foods. Our foodservice volumes continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification and margin accretive channels. Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove strong adjusted operating profits and margins. Our Branded Foods business remains a strategic growth pillar, and we are committed to supporting and growing our brands through innovation, price pack architecture, high ROI marketing support and strong customer partnerships. This is critically important in an economic environment where consumers remain more discerning with their purchasing decisions. In Chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal '23 continued in Q1 with a third consecutive quarter of over $100 million in sequential AOI increase. Operational improvements, including the bold actions we've taken along with improvements in live operations, yield, labor efficiency, and customer service, as well as improving market conditions, were the primary drivers in Q1. In Beef, limited cattle supply led to spread compression as we expected. Roughly half the loss in Q1 was related to an inventory valuation adjustment, which was primarily driven by highly volatile cattle futures. While spreads are expected to remain tight, our goal remains to be best-in-class operators so that we can manage the business as efficiently as possible. We have identified incremental opportunities to improve our execution and help offset some of the challenges from the current cattle cycle. Turning to Pork, better supply drove lower hog cost leading to improving spreads. Our team's focus on operational execution allowed us to capture the benefits of these favorable market dynamics, which resulted in improved profits both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before I hand it over to John for a financial review, let's reiterate our priorities for the year. First, we're committed to improving our financial strength and driving cash flow to support our dividend, as demonstrated in Q1. Over the past year, we announced the closure of six of our older, less-efficient plants in chicken and two of our smaller beef case-ready value-added facilities. We're already seeing the benefits of these actions and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to drive efficiency across our segments. In Chicken, our focus on enhancing our competitiveness continues. In Prepared Foods, we want to build growth momentum behind capacity additions coming online, increase our brand household penetration, and diversify and grow our foodservice business. In Beef, we acknowledge the challenges and will be prepared for multiple outcomes during the current cattle cycle. In Pork, we're gaining momentum in operational execution and are excited for continued improvements. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results and outlook. Hi, Peter. Good morning. Sure. Thanks, Peter. I'll start off and maybe I'll have others to weigh in. Let me start off just kind of State of the Union. We had a solid first quarter and we continue to build on the momentum of the back half of 2023. We are seeing the benefits of our portfolio where Chicken and Pork improvements are offsetting challenges in Beef and where our Prepared Foods continues to deliver strong results. We continue to restore performance in our Chicken business. As I said earlier, this was our third consecutive quarter of $100 million of AOI improvement. And this -- our Chicken business remains a top priority of mine. We're managing Beef through the volatility and spread tightening of the cycle. We're making great progress in driving out the inefficiency all across the supply chain in Pork. Prepared Foods is performing to plan. While we have seen softness in the retail channel, our brands have performed well. Core brand share remains near-record levels and we're regaining share in our foodservice business, and I'll talk more about that in a moment. We're cautiously optimistic about FY '24. We have considered our better-than-expected results in this quarter. We've considered our initiatives to improve performance, while also still accounting for the ongoing macro uncertainty. As John said in his opening statement, Q2 is seasonally weaker and our Q2 started off -- has started off with several significant weather events. But, having said all that, taken together, it's still early in the year and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We have a lots of work ahead of us, and we're leaving no stone unturned. We're focused on CapEx and working capital to drive cash flow and support our dividend. We are controlling the controllables and taking necessary action, including right-sizing and modernizing our footprint and network design to drive efficiencies. We are pleased with the quarter and believe we're taking the right steps. We are excited about our future and are focused on creating value for our shareholders. Specifically -- or a little bit more specifically in terms of Prepared Foods, to your question, Peter, we had -- in the quarter, we had strong top- and bottom-line performance in the quarter, with meaningful sequential improvement versus Q4 of '23. If you look at the makeup of the volume, it was driven by a balanced portfolio between retail and foodservice. We're regaining some share lost in the middle of the pandemic that we couldn't support and we also had the acquisition from a volume standpoint of Williams sausage. Our branded core business line remained a key focus, and we have a competitive advantage with volume share near-record levels and 400 basis points above Q1 '19. Let me stop with that. Melanie, anything you would add to what I've said? Sure. I mean, I'll tell you we look at the same information that I'm sure you've seen and we saw the cattle on feed report that you referenced. Unfortunately, Peter, the data doesn't indicate that heifer retention is taking place and that's obviously one of the signposts we're looking for. In the quarter, we continue to see volatility and spread tightening. We expected that. As we think about our outlook, we continue to project high cattle supplies for the balance of 2024 and even beyond. And let me pause. Brady, do you want to add anything to that? Thanks, Peter. Good morning, Adam. Thanks, Adam. So, in terms of competition, I mean, regardless of the business, I mean there's -- we have some very strong competitors in every space that we play. And so, I'll leave that there. But I'll give Melanie the opportunity to talk about more specifics in categories. For example, I would just simply say that we saw a strong performance in breakfast sausage and cocktails, and we had some headwinds in our lunch meat and our frozen protein breakfast area. Melanie, do you want to add to that? Good morning, Ben. If I could add one thing or a couple of things to that as it relates to Chicken. Those operational improvements that all of us have talked about in Chicken, those continue. And those fundamentals, while we are improved, there's still a lot of work left to do there. And we got a really good team working against those things. But keep that in mind as you are looking at Q2 and the balance of the year as well. Thanks, Ben. Let me start off, and then I will flip it to Brady to talk about Pork. Hog supply drove lower hog costs, leading to improved spreads. We're seeing a number of benefits of better execution in Pork, and we have assembled a really, really strong team in our Pork business led by Kyle Narron. He and his team have really taken out inefficiencies from procurement all the way to the customer, consumer, and very proud of that work. But I would also tell you there's still room for more. And you will probably continue to hear that from us is there's -- every time -- excuse me, every time we turn over a rock, we find something else, but where our moat is one of continual improvement. And Brady, any big nuggets that I have not touched on? Thank you. Good morning. Melanie? Tom, let me add a little more color as it relates to foodservice there. As a reminder to everyone, in the middle of the pandemic, we had some operational issues being able to produce enough product for our customers, and we essentially had to give up some business. And we've been, since the pandemic, trying to go and regain that. But we have a nice diversification between what are the traditionally quick-service restaurants and as well as broad line distribution. Good morning. So, let me start. This is Donnie. Let me start with a couple of points, and then I think John probably has a couple to add. But in terms of being prepared to give guidance, we're not prepared to do that today and talk about that. But what I can tell you is what we're doing as a company. We talked about the third consecutive quarter of over $100 million of AOI improvement. In the midst of that, what I can also tell you is market that's for grain or the meat side, those were largely offsetting one another. So, the improvements are coming from operational improvements, operational excellence both in plants and in live production and really driving out waste from the business. But we also, as we said earlier, we're realizing the benefits from plant closures that in terms of modernizing and right-sizing our footprint. So, we're seeing all of those. But this plan doesn't really is -- I mean, we've modeled the markets as they are today for the balance of the year, but this is all about operational excellence, and being more competitive and being better at what we do, at the same time driving up raw material to a more value-added and branded within the Chicken segment. John? Thank you. Good morning. Okay. Alexia, this is Don. There are a lot of questions in there. Here's what I can tell you relative to foodservice. And keep this in mind, we've talked about it today because you have seen some volume improvement relative to foodservice. I would remind you that we had given up some business in the middle of pandemic, and the nature of those contracts can be quite lengthy. And we're starting to get back in when those open up and get some volume. We have maintained in Prepared Foods the capacity which produces those products. So, if you think about it from that perspective, this overhead in these assets have been a drag on our business to some degree. We've gotten new volume to put into those assets. So that's one piece of it. We're probably not going to talk about the differential in the margin structure between foodservice and retail. But it's important that we regain that volume in foodservice. But our retail -- our iconic brands in retail continuing to support those and grow those and innovate and do merchandising like Melanie has talked about before, those are all still critical -- mission critical for us. Okay. I want to say -- once again, say thank you to all 139,000 of our team members. We're here today and have a good story to tell because of those 139,000 team members who contribute to us each and every day. Their efforts are what makes and what drives this business forward. Our strategy is working. We have the right leadership team in place to deliver, and we're poised to drive long-term opportunity and shareholder value. We've taken some steps in the right direction, but we have a lot of work to do. Thanks for your continued interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon."

            "name": "Brady Stewart",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Donnie. And Peter, that's a great question and one that we continually are studying. I think when you unpack that cattle on feed report, there's a few comments that obviously are lending itself to the numbers that we're seeing, and part of it's relative to some slower turnover that we've seen. We've seen placements for cattle on feed from some of the drought areas as well from a geographical perspective. And as you indicated, which is the spotlight of the conversation is, we have not seen significant heifer retention to-date and continue to see those heifers move into the cattle on feed report. So, continuing to focus on a few factors relative to heifer retention, obviously, how these interest rates that we see today relative to the difference or the delta today versus some of the cycles in the pack -- in the past is a highlight for us to continue to watch. And then, we'll continue to evaluate and understand how weather conditions are changed and lend themselves into a more favorable heifer retention strategy for these ranchers. No. Thanks, Donnie. And Q1, obviously, is seasonally the strongest quarter of the year. And we'd expect to see some typical seasonality as we move through specifically the latter part of this year as well. The team understands it's their responsibility to control the controllables. And as Donnie indicated, done a really good job of being able to take advantage of some of the spreads we have seen in Q1 and certainly expect those improvements to continue through the course of the year as well. Really seeing some increased operational efficiencies, and the team has done a great job increasing the true business performance through the data and analytics platforms that they've stood up that allow us for better decision-making and really adaptation of some of these market trends in the current conditions. Well, thanks for the question. And as you pointed out there, I think it's really important to emphasize what both John and Donnie indicated in the opening remarks, which was, in Q1, we saw that rapid decline in cattle futures and that was the driver for that inventory valuation adjustment, that was roughly $56 million in the first quarter. And really, as we look at the first quarter, obviously, we saw some headwinds relative to some decreased value in the drop. We saw the spread compression. And obviously, with lower supply, not only in Q1, but as we move through the rest of the year, we see that lower opportunity for cost dilution of our overhead structure relative to these volumes. But let me be really clear, we see a path to improvement as well. And from an operational excellence perspective, how we manage the business today versus the past in a different economic cycle is very important. Focus on efficiency, yield and really balancing supply and demand, not only by a cut-by-cut basis and through our grinds complex, but also in terms of yield and efficiency is going to be paramount and important to the team, and they're dialed in on that as well. We've made changes that certainly provide us opportunity in the future as well as we mentioned last quarter. We've right-sized our Beef value-added business really to match our customer needs and what we're seeing from a supply perspective as we move through this. And again, as I've mentioned before, we have a well-capitalized asset base, and believe we're really able to manage through a variety of headwinds and market conditions that we expect to see as we move through this cattle cycle. Sure. Well, thank you for the question. And I think it's really important to understand, we've really been working within historically high rates from a beef product or cut-out perspective. And when we talk about the arbitrage opportunity between a domestic sale and an export sale, really puts the domestic beef business and industry at a disadvantage right now. We're seeing large supplies from some of our competing countries that are in the southern hemisphere. And they're really on the opposite side of the cycle from we are -- from where we are. And so that's really led to increased opportunity for some of those competing countries and a decreased opportunity for us here in the U.S. However, we have seen strong domestic beef demand has led the -- held these cut-out values at a historically high level as well. Yeah. We haven't broken that out, but it's -- we haven't broken that out specifically, Ben."

            "content": "Yeah, I had a couple of comments, Adam. We expect to realize our strategic change funding throughout the year. And specifically to your question on year-over-year, both grains and markets were both lower. So, we stayed focused on improving our fundamentals year-over-year, did have a little tailwind, but it's mostly the material change we made in our fundamentals. We improved our live performance, specifically hatch and livability. We have a very disciplined S&OP process that got really tight in Q1, and our sales are not only sold out position, but our forecast accuracy has allowed us to do a better job filling orders with material less working capital. Yes, Adam, I'd just add that we're seeing really good dark meat demand. We've seen a reemergence of our wing demand, and we're seeing a slight shift towards foodservice. Yeah, I'll take that, Ken. Thanks. We've seen a lot of disruption in the [part] (ph) export side. Specific to leg quarters, freezer stocks are at a really low level and demand seems to be robust enough to clear it at very attractive prices. Yeah. And Ben, this is Wes. I'll touch briefly on Chicken. As I said earlier, parts have been interrupted due to [indiscernible]. And on leg quarters, we're seeing frozen inventory in the US at almost record lows. Our inventory continues to be in check, and the pricing has been very good going forward. Yeah, Tom, this is Wes. I'll touch on that. We have a very diverse commodity risk management group. We also have different pricing mechanisms with customers in which some of the grains flow-through through pricing. I would tell you it's moderate and in the back half of the year."
