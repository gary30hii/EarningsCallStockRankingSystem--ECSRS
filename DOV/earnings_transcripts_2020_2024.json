Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrey Galiuk: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available for playback through February 18, and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for 3 months. Dollar provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. We want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to uncertainties and risks, including the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers, suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity and cash flow. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the first -- for the quarter and for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. And with that, I will turn this call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 3. Order trends have remained positive across the majority of our portfolio since September, and we had a strong finish to the year. Our year-over-year backlog is up 21% as a result of general recovery trends across the portfolio, a meaningful increase in the CFRE segment backlog and some recognition from our customers that raw material costs and supply chain constraints are becoming more challenging into 2021, driving preorders in some markets.  Revenue at $1.8 billion was flat versus the comparable period. Adjusted segment operating margin at 17.1% was flat despite unfavorable revenue mix during the quarter.  For the full year, revenue was down 6% and adjusted segment margin up to 16.7% as a result of structural cost savings, center-led strategic initiatives, tight cost controls offsetting the impact of fixed costs under absorption. As we discussed at length in Q3, we are driving towards a strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, and we got it, with full year free cash flow increasing 24% over 2019, achieving 14% of revenue. This is what we would expect to happen as we liquidate working capital in excess of lost profits impact, and as a result of efficiency gains from our back office consolidation program.  With that backdrop, we look into 2021 with conservative optimism. Our order book is solid, albeit with a different mix as compared to last year, with DFRE having a material positive impact to the top and bottom line in '21. We are executing on many initiatives other than structural cost takeout that are expected to deliver margin improvements, which I'll cover later in the presentation.  With that, we are initiating full year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.25 to $6.45. I'll not spend a lot of time on Slide 4, which is a more detailed overview of the results of the quarter. So let's move to Slide 5.  Engineered Products revenue declined on lower shipments in CapEx levered markets such as industrial winches, waste handling equipment and vehicle services. ESG had a tough Q4 comparable to overcome and VSG was coming off a strong Q3, so the performance was largely expected, both have strong backlogs into 2021. And the Aerospace & Defense business had a strong quarter that ended a record year for the business, and demand in industrial automation has shown robust recovery contributing to our backlog as global auto sequentially ramps production. In Fueling Solutions, as we discussed at the end of Q3, the comparable benchmark for Q4 was tough. Despite the top line pressure, the segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on lower volume as our as our productivity actions remain durable.  We are beginning to see the mix benefits from our Helix and Anthem dispenser products, which we believe are winning in the marketplace. We completed the acquisition of Innovation Control Systems in the fourth quarter, which is a great addition to our vehicle launch platform. ICS is a leading supplier of access, payment and site management solutions and software, which fits into our strategy of driving long-term value from the large installed base of retail fuel sites, which we presented in October.  Sales in Imaging & Identification declined 3% organically, the core market and coating business grew on continued healthy demand for consumables and improvement in demand for principal equipment, with particularly healthy activity in the United States. Digital textile printing CapEx remains slow, but we began seeing recovery in demand for consumables and small format machines, which are likely harbingers of conditions normalizing in 2021. Imaging & Identification is our highest gross margin segment. The marketing and coating business has delivered commendable margin performance this year holding the profit line virtually unchanged. However, decrementals and textile printing on lower volumes weighed on the segment margins in Q4 and during the full year, we expect this to begin reversing progressively into 2021.  Pumps & Process Solutions returned to top line in the fourth quarter on strong growth in biopharma, medical and hygienic applications. We also began seeing cyclical recovery in industrial pumps which posted growth after several soft quarters. Compression components in aftermarket continued to be slow, but recent trends in natural gas and LNG markets gives us grounds for optimism going forward.  The fourth quarter closed off a solid margin performance in this segment, with margins expanding 150 basis points in Q4 and 220 basis points for the full year. This was driven by broad-based productivity efforts, cost controls, favorable mix and well-timed capacity expansion in biopharma and medical, which we highlighted earlier in the year.  Refrigeration & Food Equipment posted 13% organic growth, with all businesses except Food Service Equipment delivering the increase. A significant portion of the growth came from the well-advertised strength in can making. We are also very encouraged by activity in core food retail market, which grew organic top line at high single digits in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in the door case product line, where we saw double-digit growth for the full year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in heat pumps and residential applications as well as refrigerated, transport and industrial applications like semiconductors and data centers.  Margin performance effectively improved, supported by volume and actions we took in the middle of 2020. Absolute earnings increased 71% in the quarter over the comparable period. This margin before, coupled with the upcoming ramp-up of automated case line and food retail, positions us to deliver material margin expansion in 2021.  I'll pass it to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our top line continued its recovery, with sequential improvement in organic revenue over Q3. Several of our businesses, including short-cycle industrial pumps and heat exchanges, returned to positive growth in the quarter, while biopharma, aerospace and defense, marketing and coding, food retail and can making continued their positive growth trajectory from prior quarters.  FX benefited the top line by 2% or $34 million, driven principally by a strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $12 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters.  Revenue breakdown by geography reflects sequential improvement in each major geography, except -- with the exception of Asia. The U.S., our largest market, posted a 1% organic decline in the quarter, an improvement over the 4% decline in Q3 on progressively improving order rates and a strong quarter in biopharma, marking coding, food retail and can making, among others. Europe declined 3% organically, driven by retail fueling and a difficult comparable quarter in vehicle services, though partially offset by continued strength in several of our Pumps & Process Solutions businesses.  All of Asia was down 11% organically, driven principally by China, which was down 16% organically. This result in China was not unexpected as we continue to face headwinds in retail fueling due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate.  Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 2% organically, reflecting the continued momentum we see across our businesses. In the quarter, we saw organic growth in 4 out of our 5 segments. The fifth segment, fueling solutions, faced a difficult comparable quarter in the prior year, as previously discussed. Overall, our backlog is currently up approximately $300 million or 21% higher compared to this time last year, positioning us well as we enter 2021.  Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. We delivered improved sequential results in the quarter after a significant decline in Q2 and a recovery in Q3. On the top chart, adjusted segment EBIT and margin were both essentially flat year-over-year as we -- as continued productivity initiatives offset negative organic growth and dilutive impact of FX on margins.  Going to the bottom chart, adjusted net earnings declined $1 million as higher taxes and corporate expense offset improved segment EBIT. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately 21.4% for the year compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million in the quarter and $22 million for the year, or approximately $4 million lower than in 2019.  As we move into 2021, excluding the impact of discrete taxes, we expect the effective tax rate to remain essentially the same as 2020, at about 21.5%. Rightsizing and other costs were $21 million in the quarter, or $17 million after-tax, relating to several new permanent cost, containment initiatives and other items that we executed at the end of 2020.  Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance in 2020, with full year free cash flow of $939 million, a $181 million or 24% increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 21% of revenue for the fourth quarter, historically our highest cash flow quarter, and 14% for the full year, a significant increase over the prior year. The call of last quarter's -- last quarter's earnings call, we decided to prioritize prudent working capital management over fixed cost absorption to close out the year, and you can see the value delivered in our year-over-year working capital comparison. We have strong revenue visibility into Q1 and confidence in our team's ability to match industrial production with improved customer demand.  With that, I'll turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Thanks, Brad. I'm on Page 9. Let me take a few moments to give you an update on our center-led initiatives that we outlined in our strategic plan in September of 2019. While we could have not expected but transpired in 2020, we posited at the time that our portfolio had through-cycle durability and that there were opportunities to drive synergies from our diverse portfolio to improve profitability over time. Despite this, we often hear a notion that Dover is a cost-out story, likely because we give measurable structural cost saving goals each year, implying a finite nature to such endeavor.  There's a lot more than cost reductions to our improvement journey, and we continue to reinvest a portion of the savings, so we'll give you a short update on where we are on these strategic initiatives.  True in 2019, we began with the rightsizing of our SG&A base after a significant portfolio change. This was necessary and required immediate intervention. Since then, the improvements have been driven by steady productivity and structural cost actions by our operating units, and from our investments in 4 core enterprise capabilities that generate very attractive return on investment and can be leveraged across the portfolio. The investments are substantial. By the end of this coming year, the headcount involved that center-led enterprise capabilities will have increased by over 50%. These are transformational initiatives touching every quarter of our global portfolio and delivering real results that you can see in our bottom line, and there is significant runway to drive value. We are investing in the following 4 enterprise capabilities, and I'll highlight a few results, but I would encourage you to review the stats in the slides.  First, Dover Digital on Slide 10. This work began in 2017 and accelerate in 2018 with the opening of our Dover Digital Center in Boston. We have over 100 e-commerce connected product and software experts dedicated to this event. This team helps our business lever each commerce at scale and improve the customer journey with ease of doing business as well as back end efficiency for sales and order entry. For example, this year, we target to reach a run rate of $1 billion of revenue processed through digital channels much of which is service parts and catalog items compared to $100 million in 2019. This team also helps our business connect their products and enhance their offerings, which we'll progressively highlight in future presentations as we did for fueling solutions recently.  This is a multiyear journey, value creation journey, and we are very excited about what lies ahead for our digital team.  Moving to Slide 11. Our Operations Center of Excellence is a central team of domain knowledge experts that delivers health and safety, supply chain management, lean operations and advanced manufacturing and automation. This team is instrumental in driving value through rooftop consolidation and automation projects. As you know, we have a number of these in the works. We are also excited about the results of the early lean initiatives spearheading. This is another multiyear journey that we continue -- we will continue to deliver results.  Moving on to Slide 12 is our central back office system, which we call Dover Business Services. We've been at this for several years, and we're still in the early innings of expanding the scale and scope of this capability. By centralizing and offshoring transactional back office facilities, we multiply efficiency through scale, technology leverage and unit cost arbitrage. DBS is and will remain an integral part of our margin enhancement story.  And lastly, moving to Slide 3. The India innovation center is more than 600 person strong team that our operating companies can leverage for product engineering, digital solutions development, data information management, research and development and intellectual property services. The scale and expertise of this team allows our operating companies to tap resources that would have been unaffordable to them as stand-alone companies. And allows for concurrent engineering on time-sensitive projects.  So let's sum this up on Slide 14. We laid out 4 pillars of our strategy in 2019, and have been delivering through cycle. We have maintained our focus on margin improvement and continue to invest despite the economic difficulties of 2010. Our end market exposures, coupled with the strategic R&D investments we are delivering attractive growth profile. We are committed to reinvesting in our businesses as a top priority and capital allocation to maintain competitiveness, fuel growth and improve productivity.  We are making good strides on the inorganic front. Finally, we're staying disciplined in our capital allocation by returning excess capital to our shareholders via growing dividends and share repurchases.  Moving to 15, where does this leave us going into 2021? We believe that our playbook offers us a significant runway to continue delivering attractive through-cycle returns through mid-single-digit top line growth, steady margin expansion, healthy cash conversion and disciplined capital allocation and shareholder-friendly capital return posture.  Okay. I'll step off the soapbox, and let's move on to 16. We expect demand in engineered products to rebound in 2021. We have seen strong bookings recently in vehicle services and industrial automation, with relevant automotive and vehicle usage statistics trending in the right direction. Bookings have also improved to retain in waste handling, and we are nearly fully booked for the first quarter. Municipal demand will remain uncertain, but we see strong trends in the parts and digital business. As we previewed in November, we expect fueling solutions to have a modest organic growth year. There is known headwind from EMV roll off in the U.S., but there are a number of positives [indiscernible].  We are encouraged by the prospects of our new Anthem user interface solution offering. We expect robust growth in our systems and software business, where we will be launching the industry-first cloud platform developed. We also see good setup for vehicle wash and are excited about having ICs in our portfolio. We expect Imaging & Identification to perform well this year. Marketing & Coading saw a limited downside in 2020, and we've been on a good trajectory in recent quarters despite the tough comp in Q1 due to COVID-driven consumable stocking. This further improvement in services travel restriction subside and activity and serialization software is also firming up. The biggest factor in this segment is, of course, the digital textile printing unit. Our initial read is for the recovery to take place in the second half of the year, that printers will be ramping up production for 2020 apparel collections.  Pumps & Process Solution is expected to have another solid year. We expect a robust growth in biopharma and hygienic applications, the continued recovery trend in industrial pumps, plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance with a comparable basis to the second half bias to the second half. Precision components is likely to experience a slower start to the year, and we're still comping versus last year's first quarter, that saw robust upstream and downstream activity.  And finally, we expect a very strong year in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The core food retail business is operating with a strong backlog and the order trajectory has been healthy in the last few quarters. We expect retailers that have paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic to restart these strategic initiatives, and we are well positioned to participate in that activity. Additionally, we see a good outlook for natural refrigerant systems, both in Europe and also in the U.S. California was the first state to recently mandate transition to natural refrigerant systems.  We were the pioneers in the space, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the sustainability trend in the industry. Belvac, as you know, is working through a record backlog and is booked for the year. Our heat exchanger business also exited 2020 with a record backlog instructive order trajectory across multiple verticals. This will result in material margin improvement in this segment on the back of the case production automation project, higher volumes, positive business mix.  We've covered most of the items on the earlier slides, but I summarize them here in this slide for your reference. As usual, before I wrap up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their work and continued perseverance during this last year. The Dover team has delivered strong results in its difficult conditions. I commend all of our employees were doing that part. And Andrey, with that, let's move on Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: A lot of good additional information there. But just let me dig into like a couple of things, if I could, Rich. First, interesting what you said about kind of pre ordering are you able to fully protect yourself with price and hedging and other things on that type of activity that you're seeing from your customers?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Look, Jeff, I mean, I think we've got a couple of challenges going to Q1. Raw material prices are moving up. And there is a lot of constraint in logistics right now. I think that it's been going on somewhat through the fourth quarter. And it looks to be getting tighter going into the first quarter as economic activity moves up. So the bad news is, we're going to have to deal with those constraints, and we're going to have to be on the front foot in terms of offsetting raw mats in terms of whether it's either pricing or productivity. But I think that my comment about the backlog, it is influencing demand in the backlog because, I think, that there's beginning a recognition out there of, \"I've got to get my orders in because of these constraints.\" I mean, it's -- look at what's going on in auto, just as a precursor to that.  So I don't think it's bad in a way, and I don't think it's negative for us in terms of people placing orders in advance of raw material costs because, I think, that we've got some levers to pull there, and it's really short-cycle at the end of the day. The good news is, I think, to the extent that our backlogs go up from an S&OP process, we can plan more appropriately, and that drives efficiency at the factory level floor. So probably going to be a little bit of an interest in Q1, but I think, overall, it's not insurmountable.\nJeffrey Sprague: Right. And then just shifting to the DFRE. So it looks like you'll have the volumes here to fully kind of exercise the automation project. I suppose you don't want to get into margins by segments here. But can you give us a little color on how the margin should play out in that business? And is there any kind of -- other than kind of the normal seasonal peak that we'll be looking at? Any other kind of noise or movement in the margin trajectory there?\nRichard Tobin: No. I would expect that the margins to comp well every quarter, but the seasonality of those margins to remain intact.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with Jpmorgan.\nCharles Tusa: I think with the lots of buzzwords, Rich, not used to you kind of like topping at that high level about corporate strategy. But I think the message is that there's something like a little bit more sustainable than just like a couple of years of cost cuts than noticeable to me was the 25% to 35% incremental margin guide. And then the 11% to 13% of revenue in free cash flow in a year where I'll be growing pretty strongly. So basically, you should see some headwind. It shouldn't be like a great cash year, for example. I think, back in 2019, in the fall, you said 25% to 30% incrementals and 8% to 12% free cash as a percentage of sales. Are these kind of like sustainable step-ups that you'd hope to deliver over time as part of the earnings and cash algorithm?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Look, at the end of the day, we expect to be pulling on both levers, consistent margin expansion and cash flow productivity. So productivity and the working capital item. Bottom line is, as we've been saying all year, we would expect with the headwind that we'd be liquidating our balance sheet as we should in a difficult environment on the revenue side. We will have a working capital build because we've got a pretty robust revenue forecast going into '21. But do I think it's going to make our metrics worse? Not demonstrably so because I think that we're going to get the benefit of the margin expansion. And I don't expect to deteriorate at all in terms of working capital as a percent of sales.\nCharles Tusa: And I would guess -- I mean, I look at that 11% to 13% of revenues. I mean, it's not like your CapEx is actually above what I would expect it to be. I mean, is the $175 million to $200 million now a sustainable run rate? Or is that something that you push some projects out of '20 into '21? Because I think you guys are planning on that coming down a bit that there were some temporary projects. What's the outlook for CapEx for the next couple of years?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean, we've got two new transformational projects underway, one in vehicle Services group, and one in ESG, which -- look, at the end of the day, they're not nearly the same scale of the new building that we did at CPC, and what we did at DFR, but it's the same logic. I mean, it's automating what we're pretty manual processes. So we think that we're going to get a relatively quick payback in terms of the margin expansion there. It's early in the year. I think that we've tended to always forecast a higher CapEx number that actually gets delivered. That number looks reasonable considering we've got 2 bigger projects. But -- so I don't want to take the number down right now or say it's an anomaly, but experience would say that it's probably a little bit high.\nCharles Tusa: Right. But I mean, if you do 11% to 13% of revenue, even with that, it's not that bad. Just 1 quick one. You guys had talked about, I think, $25 million of temporary cost reversals as a headwind in can you just give us an update on that number, if there's anything that's coming back relative to what you did last year to protect the margins?\nRichard Tobin: There's nothing I look. At the end of the day, we'll be building. We've got estimates of building it back some incentive comp and a variety of other things. But look, it's all built into the EPS forecast that we have there. Whatever the pullback of kind of -- let me -- let me answer you this way, right? We had coverage on furloughs, okay? So that was a positive this year because it deferred the cost of us having to take those people out to a certain extent.  What we're going to bring back is going to be absorbed into industrial production in the revenue line. So net-net, that's an indifference. So what we're talking about is general SG&A, And the bigger movements there were T&E and incentive comps. So let's think positive for a moment, the incentive comp comes back, I think, T&E is going to come back. But is it going to reach 2019 levels? No.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with City Group.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Rich, with the understanding that we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in R and FE with the backlog that you have in the core food retail business picking up as well as the bell back deliveries ramping up, would you actually say that high single-digit forecast for '21 could even be conservative given the double-digit momentum that you saw in Q4?\nRichard Tobin: It's a little bit early to...\nAndrew Kaplowitz: I said we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.\nRichard Tobin: Yes, let's get ahead of ourselves while we're not getting ourselves. Look, you know what, I think that the backlog is a good precursor for delivering the incremental margins that we're looking for from a segment point of view. Our expectation, it's the highest growth segment in our forecast right now. And I'd have to go back to look because it's a margin differential, but it's a material contributor to the EPS expansion. So to the extent the trend continues because this is a relatively short-cycle business, if I just talking about refrigeration now not Belvac. Belvac is booked for the year. So we get more orders for callback, it just gets pushed into 2022, frankly. So DFR, which is generally a short-cycle business, we're covered for Q1 and beginning to get coverage into Q2. Let's get Q1 under our belt before we start moving the number up.  But it's -- a lot of the total profit change that we have baked into the EPS is coming from that segment. By the way, and the reason when you could say, well, it's not overly aggressive in terms of the conversion rate. Remember, that's one of our lower-margin businesses so that's going to bring down the consolidated conversion a little bit. We'll take it in terms of absolute profits.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then just in Engineered products, maybe just give us a little more color into what happened in the quarter in Q4? I know you said it was just basically expected to decline. Did you see any inflationary pressure in that segment in the quarter? And how are you thinking about the margin in that segment in '21?\nRichard Tobin: It's not inflation. I mean, I think that if you go back in Q3, we -- the guys did a fantastic job in VSG of delivering off a backlog that had built during the quarter. So the production performance there was very, very good. And it actually add into Q4 from a comparable point of view. So that's not a problem there. And I mean the weak part of the market, which we've been talking about all year is municipal. And generally speaking, municipal tends to get delivered at the end of the year, so we know that they had a bad comp. Having said that, look, at the end of the day, those are -- that segment is more of our industrial businesses. So that's really where the raw mat headwinds are. And look, we're going to have to work that out between volume price and productivity. But I think, we fully expect, portfolio-wide, to offset all raw material headwinds.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Hafta.\nJohn Inch: Chandra. If the economy were to rich really pick up starting, say, in the second half as let's present vaccine rollout is successful. Are you geared to handle what could be a material upsurge in demand? Or would you have to like we have to kind of come up with a plan to sort of debottleneck or expand capacity or bring a bunch of people back. How would that work?\nRichard Tobin: The only area that we've got real capacity constraint would be in a niche business like Belvac. The balance of the portfolio does not run on even 5-day, 3-shift operations, quite frankly, for the middle part, we're a 6-day a week single shift group here. So to the extent that we have some amount of visibility, and to the extent that as economic activity ramps that the supply chain keeps up with it, which it isn't right now, I don't think that we are capacity constrained in any meaningful thing.  Having said that, I mean, in terms of top line growth, I think that we are expecting economic activity to kind of sequentially ramp through '21 even in our forecast. But are we capacity constrained outside of some of our niche your businesses? No.\nJohn Inch: No, that's fair. You just mentioned supply chain, by the way. Are you at a point where you're trying to circumvent this? Or are you letting it wrong to see how it happens? Meaning, I don't know, possibly seek other suppliers, dual sourcing, that sort of thing? Or is it still sort of too early to tell?\nRichard Tobin: No, no. We're doing everything under our power to get beyond this because whether that is buying raw materials forward because into the increase in curve on plates deal or sheet metal or something like that, which we're doing. We've been giving guidance to all of our operating companies that, from a working capital perspective, if they need to build at the beginning of the year and bleed it off in the second half of the year, we take the production performance and the efficiency of that rather than getting it to stop/start kind of scenario. And then there are certain a lot of the pinch points forget kind of logistics with container freight and everything else, some of the pinch points on electronic components. We're fighting it out with everybody else.\nJohn Inch: Okay. No, that makes sense. Maybe -- maybe just lastly here. I'm actually really intrigued by the attention you put toward India, business services and so forth and deservedly so. If tower were a substantially larger company, would efficiencies in the initiatives like the Dover business services exponentially compound, I mean, you're not a huge company, right? So if you were, all of a sudden, to do M&A and become a lot larger, would sort of those benefits accrue as a compounded basis or prospectively at a linear basis? It's almost like can these things that you're creating serve to create for mechanisms to justify why Dover should actually continue to expand into adjacencies to create shareholder value?\nRichard Tobin: Well, look, the reason that we're doing it is, as we said all along that Dover's reason to exist is to bring services at scale that are kind of our smaller companies would not be able to do on their own.  Having said that, as we build -- as we build those services, we're not even beginning to scratch the surface of the leverage that we get. Because the fact of the matter is, despite the robust trend and growth that we have, we're continuing to reinvest. At a certain point, you've built enough scale that bringing on another 100,000 transactions doesn't require you to build out anything more. So you flip over in terms of the benefit of that leverage.  Now having said that, we have a variety of conversations around here about being a compounder and doing something on the inorganic side. This is clearly an asset for us to extract synergy value of anything that we were to buy.\nOperator: Appreciate it. Next question will come from the line of Scott Davis from Numis Research Research.\nScott Davis: Scott, Rich, can you give us a little bit more color on retail fueling in China. And just are we still decelerating? Are we kind of at a new normal demand level?\nRichard Tobin: All right. Yes, that works. Thanks, Andre. I think this is the last bad comp for us. Which was on that double-wall issue. But having said that, the volume that we see out of, primarily, the NOx in China has been pretty low. We don't -- we had a big conversation around here the other day whether that's because of -- is the volume down, and we're missing out on it? Or is the volume just down? We've gone out to all of our traditional customers in China. We still rate very well in terms of the purchasing programs. I just think that, for whatever reason that 2020 was a down cycle in terms of kind of the NOC build-out of their retail operations. Early to say whether that recovers, and that's not really built into our forecast for '21. But at some point, it's going to have to.\nScott Davis: Okay. Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, I mean, you talked a little about inventories, but it's hard to say, just given the diversity of your businesses, of course, but are inventories back to normal, you would say, at the customer level, as we've heard below term line inventories for several quarters now, so was back to normal in on double ordering?\nRichard Tobin: Unfortunately, it's 1 of these. It depends, Scott answers. We have businesses like our industrial pumps business that sells through stocking distributors are early reads here in January is there's an amount of restocking going on because our backlogs and the industrial businesses there are building the same thing with material handling. Those backlogs are building. So I think it's fair to say that everybody is very prudent in terms of inventories on the distribution side. In '20, they -- now everybody is trying to make two calls. What is economic activity going to be in '21?  And the second thing I mentioned of if there are going to be supply constraints as everybody ramps sequentially, do I got to get on the front foot and get my orders in because there's a potential that some of those deliveries are going to be delayed outside of the quarter. So there's really two of those phenomenons going on. Do I think that they're severely under stock? No. But I think that, by and large, our stocking distributors are going to stock-based on what they think that the revenue is going to be and -- which is built into our forecast.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just a first question around any margin color by segment you can give. I see the $25 million to $35 million guide firm ahead of incremental margins. Any segments to call out being extreme ends of that spectrum? And maybe just to find a point, in DFS, should we expect operating margins to grow this year? Or that might be a challenge because of the EMV mix headwind?\nRichard Tobin: There is plurality in terms of incremental margin with the exception of Engineered products, which would be slightly lower. So let's discuss why, right? The Engineered products is going to be slightly lower just because of the gross margin within that segment. And despite the fact that DRFE has lower gross margins at the segmental level, the revenue growth there is so high that you're getting a pretty big impact in terms of absorption benefit year-over-year. So, now, having said that, we do have structural cost savings that are rolling through at the same time, and that depends segment by segment. But I think that my comments here are -- I think you've got your finger on it for DFS because it's a relatively low growth environment, and it is a little bit negative because of the mix, but we think that we can make that up and do the product 3. So then the hierarchy would be Engineered products, the lowest and then the plurality, again, across the rest of the portfolio.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Then see the full year guide across the firm. Just wondered perhaps the first quarter, maybe just talk about orders and bookings in recent weeks? And should we expect the first quarter to look maybe a little better than Q4 in terms of year-on-year revenue and margin, but not substantially different until Q2?\nRichard Tobin: I think the answer is yes, but that is a calculation that I have not done around here. I can just tell you that what you would expect is the toughest comp is Q1 to Q1 just because it's pre-pandemic to entering into '21, but we expect it to be better vis-\u00e0-vis Q1. Clearly, Q2 comp is going to be a relatively low bar to hurdle. And then the back end of the year is going to be as we mentioned during the color on the segments that we have certain businesses that we believe are back-end loaded, either because of seasonality or based on where they are in the recovery of those markets.  So we expect to be better in Q1, everybody is going to be better in Q2, and then regular seasonality from there.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question. You're definitely sort of starting to find all cylinders when it comes to operational storage is starting to deliver consistently on the operational algorithm. But can you just talk about how is your strategy on capital allocation, and, specifically, M&A is evolving going forward? And what kind of opportunities should we be thinking for 2021? And well, how it in terms of availability?\nRichard Tobin: I think that the hierarchy, we've been over a variety of different times, so that's unchanged. I think in terms of opportunity, there's plenty out there, and a lot of it is very expensive for all the reasons that we've talked about. We're on the front foot, actually spent more if you go, I don't know the slide number was, we spent more in '20 versus '19.\nAndrew Obin: That's exactly right.\nRichard Tobin: Right. Yes. We tried to spend a lot more than that, quite frankly, but couldn't get it done because of valuation or a variety of different things. So look, I'm very confident in, as you described it, the operational algorithm here. I think that this is just a roll forward of what we've done for the last couple of years. So our confidence of converting revenue into incremental margin is quite high. I think we have a lot of businesses that have earned the right to grow inorganically. We just got to find the targets and execute on them without getting crazy.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up, I think John has asked you about the supply chain. But how has your thinking about the supply chain has evolved throughout the COVID sort of pandemic? You manage it very well, but anything different that you guys are going to do going forward in terms of where you're sourcing? And I know it's at extension of John's question, but maybe more color.\nRichard Tobin: Look, I mean, we're not -- our supply chains are relatively discrete. So any moves that we make are -- we're not auto OEM, and we have to make strategic decisions based on geopolitics and foreign currency and things like that. So we're changing it all the time to a certain extent. I think that the trade of buying low-value, high commodity price exposure, basic metal working out of Asia and bringing back to the U.S., I think that, that has been dying for a couple of years now, part and parcel of the reason that we're making some investments into VSG and ESG right now because we think that we can be more competitive and get the industrial absorption of doing it ourselves to a certain extent. But we're not we're not making big strategic decisions and not making big swings, but we're always trying to adapt the supply chain.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoseph Ritchie: On maybe following on that last question, your comments around being front footed on M&A. Maybe just the flip side of that argument, given where valuation levels are right now, you could argue maybe there hasn't been a better time to looking at the portfolio closer in terms of maybe unlocking value on assets that you don't expect to be part of the portfolio longer term. So maybe just some thoughts on that, and how you're thinking about that specifically for 2021?\nRichard Tobin: Joe, it's not changed. I mean we're constantly revisiting a variety of pieces of the portfolio. And that's really all I can say about it at the end of the day, right? We may have views on individual pieces, but we don't want that to get in the way of us extracting the maximum value that we can out of the pieces that we have. So I spent a lot of time here in terms of portfolio construction on both -- and more on the in and then the out. But we screen all of our businesses for their participation strategy and changes in the marketplace and everything else, not so much, \"Hay, wait a minute, everybody is paying a lot for things.\" So maybe we should go to market. We look at it more as in terms of its hierarchy in terms of return on invested capital in the cup and whether they are advantaged or disadvantaged structurally over the next time horizon.\nJoseph Ritchie: Yes. That makes sense, and I don't mean this to be a perfect segue, but I did want to talk about food retail to some degree. You talked last quarter about the fact that margins have gotten back to the low teens, remodeling had restored. I guess, how do we take the comments around like backlog and whether that backlog is building because it's been potentially more difficult to continue on the remodeling at this point given the current coronavirus cases surging? Just want to get a better understanding for whether you're getting on-premise access. And then secondly, how the margins have kind of even trended given being on the third quarter for the food retail business?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean, we're expecting big things from the retail food business this year. For sure, a lot of the deferments that happened because of COVID access and a variety of other forces are clearly what's building the backlog into '21. But having said that, we've gone through a 4.5- to 5-year cycle where there hasn't been even, we would argue, replacement or maintenance spending in terms of food retail. So there is some pent-up demand there. We think that we have a more competitive product now. We're changing the cost structure of that product.  And as we talked about before, our view is that what the customers really value in this business is being able to have the product available when they want it. And to the extent that now we've changed -- are changing the dynamic of our lead times, I think that's beginning to be reflected in our backlog. So this is expense. The management team of this business has spent 2.5 years, working real hard to transform this business. And our expectations in terms of profitability this year is material in terms of what's baked into our EPS.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: We have covered a lot of ground already. So I really want to talk about the sort of the frame of FY '21 you have layed out. And what struck me was your revenue growth range of 5% to 6% is quite tight and it implies good visibility, maybe some considers them. That's a good sort of a question. And the second is your range for margins, 25% to 35%, is quite a bit wide than we normally see. So we normally see more precision on margins and that's revenues in your vice versa. So I wonder if you could maybe point on that. And the width of the margin range, is that a function of portfolio mix primarily? Or is there just some insertion the raw material? Any color there would be helpful?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Nigel. I mean, look, I would expect that we are going to tighten both those changes progressively as we go through the year. But I mean, you've got your finger on it. I mean, we're predicting even if we go to the organic revenue, which doesn't have that mix, the margin does have FX in it. So we're predicting FX in advance of 12 months and predicting mix over a wide diverse portfolio in terms of gross margin. So we need to give ourselves a little bit of latitude there. As I mentioned in the previous question before, the good news is that refrigeration is coming back and in terms of absolute profits, it's going to be material to the bottom line. That's not really great in terms of consolidated conversion margin just because of the of the EBIT margin of that particular business. So if you go back to the question, I think, that was just asked before, well, could that revenue be higher?  Are we at an inflection point because there's really going to be -- and we're under forecasting refrigeration for the year. In a way, I hope we are. What that's going to do is push up the top line, but it's going to draw down the conversion margin, but we'll take the absolute profit. So it's our best guess right now. I guess, at the beginning of the year, we like to give us some latitude. I think that the history around here has been to try to hit the top, and we've caught every intention of trying to do so.\nNigel Coe: And then my follow-on is really the comment around the prebuy in PRAs or preordering because of supply change constraints, which makes total sense, and we're certainly hearing about supply chain constraints. But are you getting this feedback from customers? Is it your gut instinct telling you that this is happening? And therefore, should we expect there to be maybe a moderation in order rates in 1Q sort of as a consequence of that 4Q dynamic?\nRichard Tobin: It is my gut feeling. We have a President -- operating company presidents meeting as soon as we finish up with your question, and that's one of the things we're digging into. But based on what we're seeing, in our own operations and the guidance that we are giving our own operations of, if you're seeing constraints out there, you better get on the front foot and start buying components to the detriment of working capital, which we know we can bleed off of the balance of the year, let's not miss out on deliveries and production performance. So if we're doing it, my expectation is that everybody is doing it. So I think it's to the detriment of order rates through the balance of the year? No, I don't. Because I think the backed in -- look, there's always going to be volatility quarter-by-quarter. But what's baked into our revenue forecast is shipments, for lack of better word. If there's some amount of -- and look, at the end of the day, you get a backlog that's in access to your first quarter production, you're probably not going to get it out anyway. So the good news, I think when I answered sprague before is, you know what, the longer -- the bigger the backlog that we have, the more efficiently we should be able to run our factories, and that's margin accretive.\nOperator: The last question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Market.\nDeane Dray: Would be interested in hearing what the dynamics are around that natural refrigerant, Rich, that you called out, can your equipment be used for that? Does it have to be retrofit? And how do you think this trend develops from here?\nRichard Tobin: Well, we did a press release on it not too long ago. So you can see our view based on what the ruling for California was. We are a leader in the systems business in Europe, and Europe is probably 3 to 5 years ahead of the United States. So we have the technology. It's now going to be a question of what the adoption rates and where they are regulatory mandated or individual retail operations want to as part of ESG go green and begin adapting those solutions. So we feel really good about our position in terms of having the technology readily available.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then just a second question unrelated. If the new administration is part of the stimulus program puts through some restrictions about buy American products, how is Dover's position just broadly if that restriction comes through?\nRichard Tobin: I don't think it would be materially beneficial. Generally speaking, we've make and ship in the jurisdiction that we operate in as an overall comment.\nDeane Dray: Could you be flexible in terms of your supply chain in terms of doing some sub as kind of lays in the U.S. to qualify? Just the last time just went through, that's what we saw companies were speaking on the on side.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I think that if we were a big, vertically-integrated operation, yes, I think that there would be more of a challenge. We don't -- we won't bring in assemble product of any grand scale that you can break apart in containers and put value-added on that. I mean, I've been through this previous life. Yes -- look, at the end of the day, I don't think it's going to move the needle for us. The only thing that comes to mind is if we were a component part and somebody wants to source into the United States and had been sourcing -- and been importing. Is that an opportunity? I guess, sure. I wouldn't have any idea how to scale it right now, though.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer period and ends Dover's Quarter fiscal Year Ending 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you.",

            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our top line continued its recovery, with sequential improvement in organic revenue over Q3. Several of our businesses, including short-cycle industrial pumps and heat exchanges, returned to positive growth in the quarter, while biopharma, aerospace and defense, marketing and coding, food retail and can making continued their positive growth trajectory from prior quarters.  FX benefited the top line by 2% or $34 million, driven principally by a strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $12 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters.  Revenue breakdown by geography reflects sequential improvement in each major geography, except -- with the exception of Asia. The U.S., our largest market, posted a 1% organic decline in the quarter, an improvement over the 4% decline in Q3 on progressively improving order rates and a strong quarter in biopharma, marking coding, food retail and can making, among others. Europe declined 3% organically, driven by retail fueling and a difficult comparable quarter in vehicle services, though partially offset by continued strength in several of our Pumps & Process Solutions businesses.  All of Asia was down 11% organically, driven principally by China, which was down 16% organically. This result in China was not unexpected as we continue to face headwinds in retail fueling due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate.  Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 2% organically, reflecting the continued momentum we see across our businesses. In the quarter, we saw organic growth in 4 out of our 5 segments. The fifth segment, fueling solutions, faced a difficult comparable quarter in the prior year, as previously discussed. Overall, our backlog is currently up approximately $300 million or 21% higher compared to this time last year, positioning us well as we enter 2021.  Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. We delivered improved sequential results in the quarter after a significant decline in Q2 and a recovery in Q3. On the top chart, adjusted segment EBIT and margin were both essentially flat year-over-year as we -- as continued productivity initiatives offset negative organic growth and dilutive impact of FX on margins.  Going to the bottom chart, adjusted net earnings declined $1 million as higher taxes and corporate expense offset improved segment EBIT. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately 21.4% for the year compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million in the quarter and $22 million for the year, or approximately $4 million lower than in 2019.  As we move into 2021, excluding the impact of discrete taxes, we expect the effective tax rate to remain essentially the same as 2020, at about 21.5%. Rightsizing and other costs were $21 million in the quarter, or $17 million after-tax, relating to several new permanent cost, containment initiatives and other items that we executed at the end of 2020.  Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance in 2020, with full year free cash flow of $939 million, a $181 million or 24% increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 21% of revenue for the fourth quarter, historically our highest cash flow quarter, and 14% for the full year, a significant increase over the prior year. The call of last quarter's -- last quarter's earnings call, we decided to prioritize prudent working capital management over fixed cost absorption to close out the year, and you can see the value delivered in our year-over-year working capital comparison. We have strong revenue visibility into Q1 and confidence in our team's ability to match industrial production with improved customer demand.  With that, I'll turn it back to Rich."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 3. Order trends have remained positive across the majority of our portfolio since September, and we had a strong finish to the year. Our year-over-year backlog is up 21% as a result of general recovery trends across the portfolio, a meaningful increase in the CFRE segment backlog and some recognition from our customers that raw material costs and supply chain constraints are becoming more challenging into 2021, driving preorders in some markets.  Revenue at $1.8 billion was flat versus the comparable period. Adjusted segment operating margin at 17.1% was flat despite unfavorable revenue mix during the quarter.  For the full year, revenue was down 6% and adjusted segment margin up to 16.7% as a result of structural cost savings, center-led strategic initiatives, tight cost controls offsetting the impact of fixed costs under absorption. As we discussed at length in Q3, we are driving towards a strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, and we got it, with full year free cash flow increasing 24% over 2019, achieving 14% of revenue. This is what we would expect to happen as we liquidate working capital in excess of lost profits impact, and as a result of efficiency gains from our back office consolidation program.  With that backdrop, we look into 2021 with conservative optimism. Our order book is solid, albeit with a different mix as compared to last year, with DFRE having a material positive impact to the top and bottom line in '21. We are executing on many initiatives other than structural cost takeout that are expected to deliver margin improvements, which I'll cover later in the presentation.  With that, we are initiating full year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.25 to $6.45. I'll not spend a lot of time on Slide 4, which is a more detailed overview of the results of the quarter. So let's move to Slide 5.  Engineered Products revenue declined on lower shipments in CapEx levered markets such as industrial winches, waste handling equipment and vehicle services. ESG had a tough Q4 comparable to overcome and VSG was coming off a strong Q3, so the performance was largely expected, both have strong backlogs into 2021. And the Aerospace & Defense business had a strong quarter that ended a record year for the business, and demand in industrial automation has shown robust recovery contributing to our backlog as global auto sequentially ramps production. In Fueling Solutions, as we discussed at the end of Q3, the comparable benchmark for Q4 was tough. Despite the top line pressure, the segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on lower volume as our as our productivity actions remain durable.  We are beginning to see the mix benefits from our Helix and Anthem dispenser products, which we believe are winning in the marketplace. We completed the acquisition of Innovation Control Systems in the fourth quarter, which is a great addition to our vehicle launch platform. ICS is a leading supplier of access, payment and site management solutions and software, which fits into our strategy of driving long-term value from the large installed base of retail fuel sites, which we presented in October.  Sales in Imaging & Identification declined 3% organically, the core market and coating business grew on continued healthy demand for consumables and improvement in demand for principal equipment, with particularly healthy activity in the United States. Digital textile printing CapEx remains slow, but we began seeing recovery in demand for consumables and small format machines, which are likely harbingers of conditions normalizing in 2021. Imaging & Identification is our highest gross margin segment. The marketing and coating business has delivered commendable margin performance this year holding the profit line virtually unchanged. However, decrementals and textile printing on lower volumes weighed on the segment margins in Q4 and during the full year, we expect this to begin reversing progressively into 2021.  Pumps & Process Solutions returned to top line in the fourth quarter on strong growth in biopharma, medical and hygienic applications. We also began seeing cyclical recovery in industrial pumps which posted growth after several soft quarters. Compression components in aftermarket continued to be slow, but recent trends in natural gas and LNG markets gives us grounds for optimism going forward.  The fourth quarter closed off a solid margin performance in this segment, with margins expanding 150 basis points in Q4 and 220 basis points for the full year. This was driven by broad-based productivity efforts, cost controls, favorable mix and well-timed capacity expansion in biopharma and medical, which we highlighted earlier in the year.  Refrigeration & Food Equipment posted 13% organic growth, with all businesses except Food Service Equipment delivering the increase. A significant portion of the growth came from the well-advertised strength in can making. We are also very encouraged by activity in core food retail market, which grew organic top line at high single digits in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in the door case product line, where we saw double-digit growth for the full year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in heat pumps and residential applications as well as refrigerated, transport and industrial applications like semiconductors and data centers.  Margin performance effectively improved, supported by volume and actions we took in the middle of 2020. Absolute earnings increased 71% in the quarter over the comparable period. This margin before, coupled with the upcoming ramp-up of automated case line and food retail, positions us to deliver material margin expansion in 2021.  I'll pass it to Brad here. Okay. Thanks, Brad. I'm on Page 9. Let me take a few moments to give you an update on our center-led initiatives that we outlined in our strategic plan in September of 2019. While we could have not expected but transpired in 2020, we posited at the time that our portfolio had through-cycle durability and that there were opportunities to drive synergies from our diverse portfolio to improve profitability over time. Despite this, we often hear a notion that Dover is a cost-out story, likely because we give measurable structural cost saving goals each year, implying a finite nature to such endeavor.  There's a lot more than cost reductions to our improvement journey, and we continue to reinvest a portion of the savings, so we'll give you a short update on where we are on these strategic initiatives.  True in 2019, we began with the rightsizing of our SG&A base after a significant portfolio change. This was necessary and required immediate intervention. Since then, the improvements have been driven by steady productivity and structural cost actions by our operating units, and from our investments in 4 core enterprise capabilities that generate very attractive return on investment and can be leveraged across the portfolio. The investments are substantial. By the end of this coming year, the headcount involved that center-led enterprise capabilities will have increased by over 50%. These are transformational initiatives touching every quarter of our global portfolio and delivering real results that you can see in our bottom line, and there is significant runway to drive value. We are investing in the following 4 enterprise capabilities, and I'll highlight a few results, but I would encourage you to review the stats in the slides.  First, Dover Digital on Slide 10. This work began in 2017 and accelerate in 2018 with the opening of our Dover Digital Center in Boston. We have over 100 e-commerce connected product and software experts dedicated to this event. This team helps our business lever each commerce at scale and improve the customer journey with ease of doing business as well as back end efficiency for sales and order entry. For example, this year, we target to reach a run rate of $1 billion of revenue processed through digital channels much of which is service parts and catalog items compared to $100 million in 2019. This team also helps our business connect their products and enhance their offerings, which we'll progressively highlight in future presentations as we did for fueling solutions recently.  This is a multiyear journey, value creation journey, and we are very excited about what lies ahead for our digital team.  Moving to Slide 11. Our Operations Center of Excellence is a central team of domain knowledge experts that delivers health and safety, supply chain management, lean operations and advanced manufacturing and automation. This team is instrumental in driving value through rooftop consolidation and automation projects. As you know, we have a number of these in the works. We are also excited about the results of the early lean initiatives spearheading. This is another multiyear journey that we continue -- we will continue to deliver results.  Moving on to Slide 12 is our central back office system, which we call Dover Business Services. We've been at this for several years, and we're still in the early innings of expanding the scale and scope of this capability. By centralizing and offshoring transactional back office facilities, we multiply efficiency through scale, technology leverage and unit cost arbitrage. DBS is and will remain an integral part of our margin enhancement story.  And lastly, moving to Slide 3. The India innovation center is more than 600 person strong team that our operating companies can leverage for product engineering, digital solutions development, data information management, research and development and intellectual property services. The scale and expertise of this team allows our operating companies to tap resources that would have been unaffordable to them as stand-alone companies. And allows for concurrent engineering on time-sensitive projects.  So let's sum this up on Slide 14. We laid out 4 pillars of our strategy in 2019, and have been delivering through cycle. We have maintained our focus on margin improvement and continue to invest despite the economic difficulties of 2010. Our end market exposures, coupled with the strategic R&D investments we are delivering attractive growth profile. We are committed to reinvesting in our businesses as a top priority and capital allocation to maintain competitiveness, fuel growth and improve productivity.  We are making good strides on the inorganic front. Finally, we're staying disciplined in our capital allocation by returning excess capital to our shareholders via growing dividends and share repurchases.  Moving to 15, where does this leave us going into 2021? We believe that our playbook offers us a significant runway to continue delivering attractive through-cycle returns through mid-single-digit top line growth, steady margin expansion, healthy cash conversion and disciplined capital allocation and shareholder-friendly capital return posture.  Okay. I'll step off the soapbox, and let's move on to 16. We expect demand in engineered products to rebound in 2021. We have seen strong bookings recently in vehicle services and industrial automation, with relevant automotive and vehicle usage statistics trending in the right direction. Bookings have also improved to retain in waste handling, and we are nearly fully booked for the first quarter. Municipal demand will remain uncertain, but we see strong trends in the parts and digital business. As we previewed in November, we expect fueling solutions to have a modest organic growth year. There is known headwind from EMV roll off in the U.S., but there are a number of positives [indiscernible].  We are encouraged by the prospects of our new Anthem user interface solution offering. We expect robust growth in our systems and software business, where we will be launching the industry-first cloud platform developed. We also see good setup for vehicle wash and are excited about having ICs in our portfolio. We expect Imaging & Identification to perform well this year. Marketing & Coading saw a limited downside in 2020, and we've been on a good trajectory in recent quarters despite the tough comp in Q1 due to COVID-driven consumable stocking. This further improvement in services travel restriction subside and activity and serialization software is also firming up. The biggest factor in this segment is, of course, the digital textile printing unit. Our initial read is for the recovery to take place in the second half of the year, that printers will be ramping up production for 2020 apparel collections.  Pumps & Process Solution is expected to have another solid year. We expect a robust growth in biopharma and hygienic applications, the continued recovery trend in industrial pumps, plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance with a comparable basis to the second half bias to the second half. Precision components is likely to experience a slower start to the year, and we're still comping versus last year's first quarter, that saw robust upstream and downstream activity.  And finally, we expect a very strong year in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The core food retail business is operating with a strong backlog and the order trajectory has been healthy in the last few quarters. We expect retailers that have paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic to restart these strategic initiatives, and we are well positioned to participate in that activity. Additionally, we see a good outlook for natural refrigerant systems, both in Europe and also in the U.S. California was the first state to recently mandate transition to natural refrigerant systems.  We were the pioneers in the space, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the sustainability trend in the industry. Belvac, as you know, is working through a record backlog and is booked for the year. Our heat exchanger business also exited 2020 with a record backlog instructive order trajectory across multiple verticals. This will result in material margin improvement in this segment on the back of the case production automation project, higher volumes, positive business mix.  We've covered most of the items on the earlier slides, but I summarize them here in this slide for your reference. As usual, before I wrap up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their work and continued perseverance during this last year. The Dover team has delivered strong results in its difficult conditions. I commend all of our employees were doing that part. And Andrey, with that, let's move on Q&A. Yes. Look, Jeff, I mean, I think we've got a couple of challenges going to Q1. Raw material prices are moving up. And there is a lot of constraint in logistics right now. I think that it's been going on somewhat through the fourth quarter. And it looks to be getting tighter going into the first quarter as economic activity moves up. So the bad news is, we're going to have to deal with those constraints, and we're going to have to be on the front foot in terms of offsetting raw mats in terms of whether it's either pricing or productivity. But I think that my comment about the backlog, it is influencing demand in the backlog because, I think, that there's beginning a recognition out there of, \"I've got to get my orders in because of these constraints.\" I mean, it's -- look at what's going on in auto, just as a precursor to that.  So I don't think it's bad in a way, and I don't think it's negative for us in terms of people placing orders in advance of raw material costs because, I think, that we've got some levers to pull there, and it's really short-cycle at the end of the day. The good news is, I think, to the extent that our backlogs go up from an S&OP process, we can plan more appropriately, and that drives efficiency at the factory level floor. So probably going to be a little bit of an interest in Q1, but I think, overall, it's not insurmountable. No. I would expect that the margins to comp well every quarter, but the seasonality of those margins to remain intact. Yes. Look, at the end of the day, we expect to be pulling on both levers, consistent margin expansion and cash flow productivity. So productivity and the working capital item. Bottom line is, as we've been saying all year, we would expect with the headwind that we'd be liquidating our balance sheet as we should in a difficult environment on the revenue side. We will have a working capital build because we've got a pretty robust revenue forecast going into '21. But do I think it's going to make our metrics worse? Not demonstrably so because I think that we're going to get the benefit of the margin expansion. And I don't expect to deteriorate at all in terms of working capital as a percent of sales. Yes. I mean, we've got two new transformational projects underway, one in vehicle Services group, and one in ESG, which -- look, at the end of the day, they're not nearly the same scale of the new building that we did at CPC, and what we did at DFR, but it's the same logic. I mean, it's automating what we're pretty manual processes. So we think that we're going to get a relatively quick payback in terms of the margin expansion there. It's early in the year. I think that we've tended to always forecast a higher CapEx number that actually gets delivered. That number looks reasonable considering we've got 2 bigger projects. But -- so I don't want to take the number down right now or say it's an anomaly, but experience would say that it's probably a little bit high. There's nothing I look. At the end of the day, we'll be building. We've got estimates of building it back some incentive comp and a variety of other things. But look, it's all built into the EPS forecast that we have there. Whatever the pullback of kind of -- let me -- let me answer you this way, right? We had coverage on furloughs, okay? So that was a positive this year because it deferred the cost of us having to take those people out to a certain extent.  What we're going to bring back is going to be absorbed into industrial production in the revenue line. So net-net, that's an indifference. So what we're talking about is general SG&A, And the bigger movements there were T&E and incentive comps. So let's think positive for a moment, the incentive comp comes back, I think, T&E is going to come back. But is it going to reach 2019 levels? No. It's a little bit early to... Yes, let's get ahead of ourselves while we're not getting ourselves. Look, you know what, I think that the backlog is a good precursor for delivering the incremental margins that we're looking for from a segment point of view. Our expectation, it's the highest growth segment in our forecast right now. And I'd have to go back to look because it's a margin differential, but it's a material contributor to the EPS expansion. So to the extent the trend continues because this is a relatively short-cycle business, if I just talking about refrigeration now not Belvac. Belvac is booked for the year. So we get more orders for callback, it just gets pushed into 2022, frankly. So DFR, which is generally a short-cycle business, we're covered for Q1 and beginning to get coverage into Q2. Let's get Q1 under our belt before we start moving the number up.  But it's -- a lot of the total profit change that we have baked into the EPS is coming from that segment. By the way, and the reason when you could say, well, it's not overly aggressive in terms of the conversion rate. Remember, that's one of our lower-margin businesses so that's going to bring down the consolidated conversion a little bit. We'll take it in terms of absolute profits. It's not inflation. I mean, I think that if you go back in Q3, we -- the guys did a fantastic job in VSG of delivering off a backlog that had built during the quarter. So the production performance there was very, very good. And it actually add into Q4 from a comparable point of view. So that's not a problem there. And I mean the weak part of the market, which we've been talking about all year is municipal. And generally speaking, municipal tends to get delivered at the end of the year, so we know that they had a bad comp. Having said that, look, at the end of the day, those are -- that segment is more of our industrial businesses. So that's really where the raw mat headwinds are. And look, we're going to have to work that out between volume price and productivity. But I think, we fully expect, portfolio-wide, to offset all raw material headwinds. The only area that we've got real capacity constraint would be in a niche business like Belvac. The balance of the portfolio does not run on even 5-day, 3-shift operations, quite frankly, for the middle part, we're a 6-day a week single shift group here. So to the extent that we have some amount of visibility, and to the extent that as economic activity ramps that the supply chain keeps up with it, which it isn't right now, I don't think that we are capacity constrained in any meaningful thing.  Having said that, I mean, in terms of top line growth, I think that we are expecting economic activity to kind of sequentially ramp through '21 even in our forecast. But are we capacity constrained outside of some of our niche your businesses? No. No, no. We're doing everything under our power to get beyond this because whether that is buying raw materials forward because into the increase in curve on plates deal or sheet metal or something like that, which we're doing. We've been giving guidance to all of our operating companies that, from a working capital perspective, if they need to build at the beginning of the year and bleed it off in the second half of the year, we take the production performance and the efficiency of that rather than getting it to stop/start kind of scenario. And then there are certain a lot of the pinch points forget kind of logistics with container freight and everything else, some of the pinch points on electronic components. We're fighting it out with everybody else. Well, look, the reason that we're doing it is, as we said all along that Dover's reason to exist is to bring services at scale that are kind of our smaller companies would not be able to do on their own.  Having said that, as we build -- as we build those services, we're not even beginning to scratch the surface of the leverage that we get. Because the fact of the matter is, despite the robust trend and growth that we have, we're continuing to reinvest. At a certain point, you've built enough scale that bringing on another 100,000 transactions doesn't require you to build out anything more. So you flip over in terms of the benefit of that leverage.  Now having said that, we have a variety of conversations around here about being a compounder and doing something on the inorganic side. This is clearly an asset for us to extract synergy value of anything that we were to buy. All right. Yes, that works. Thanks, Andre. I think this is the last bad comp for us. Which was on that double-wall issue. But having said that, the volume that we see out of, primarily, the NOx in China has been pretty low. We don't -- we had a big conversation around here the other day whether that's because of -- is the volume down, and we're missing out on it? Or is the volume just down? We've gone out to all of our traditional customers in China. We still rate very well in terms of the purchasing programs. I just think that, for whatever reason that 2020 was a down cycle in terms of kind of the NOC build-out of their retail operations. Early to say whether that recovers, and that's not really built into our forecast for '21. But at some point, it's going to have to. Unfortunately, it's 1 of these. It depends, Scott answers. We have businesses like our industrial pumps business that sells through stocking distributors are early reads here in January is there's an amount of restocking going on because our backlogs and the industrial businesses there are building the same thing with material handling. Those backlogs are building. So I think it's fair to say that everybody is very prudent in terms of inventories on the distribution side. In '20, they -- now everybody is trying to make two calls. What is economic activity going to be in '21?  And the second thing I mentioned of if there are going to be supply constraints as everybody ramps sequentially, do I got to get on the front foot and get my orders in because there's a potential that some of those deliveries are going to be delayed outside of the quarter. So there's really two of those phenomenons going on. Do I think that they're severely under stock? No. But I think that, by and large, our stocking distributors are going to stock-based on what they think that the revenue is going to be and -- which is built into our forecast. There is plurality in terms of incremental margin with the exception of Engineered products, which would be slightly lower. So let's discuss why, right? The Engineered products is going to be slightly lower just because of the gross margin within that segment. And despite the fact that DRFE has lower gross margins at the segmental level, the revenue growth there is so high that you're getting a pretty big impact in terms of absorption benefit year-over-year. So, now, having said that, we do have structural cost savings that are rolling through at the same time, and that depends segment by segment. But I think that my comments here are -- I think you've got your finger on it for DFS because it's a relatively low growth environment, and it is a little bit negative because of the mix, but we think that we can make that up and do the product 3. So then the hierarchy would be Engineered products, the lowest and then the plurality, again, across the rest of the portfolio. I think the answer is yes, but that is a calculation that I have not done around here. I can just tell you that what you would expect is the toughest comp is Q1 to Q1 just because it's pre-pandemic to entering into '21, but we expect it to be better vis-a\u0300-vis Q1. Clearly, Q2 comp is going to be a relatively low bar to hurdle. And then the back end of the year is going to be as we mentioned during the color on the segments that we have certain businesses that we believe are back-end loaded, either because of seasonality or based on where they are in the recovery of those markets.  So we expect to be better in Q1, everybody is going to be better in Q2, and then regular seasonality from there. I think that the hierarchy, we've been over a variety of different times, so that's unchanged. I think in terms of opportunity, there's plenty out there, and a lot of it is very expensive for all the reasons that we've talked about. We're on the front foot, actually spent more if you go, I don't know the slide number was, we spent more in '20 versus '19. Right. Yes. We tried to spend a lot more than that, quite frankly, but couldn't get it done because of valuation or a variety of different things. So look, I'm very confident in, as you described it, the operational algorithm here. I think that this is just a roll forward of what we've done for the last couple of years. So our confidence of converting revenue into incremental margin is quite high. I think we have a lot of businesses that have earned the right to grow inorganically. We just got to find the targets and execute on them without getting crazy. Look, I mean, we're not -- our supply chains are relatively discrete. So any moves that we make are -- we're not auto OEM, and we have to make strategic decisions based on geopolitics and foreign currency and things like that. So we're changing it all the time to a certain extent. I think that the trade of buying low-value, high commodity price exposure, basic metal working out of Asia and bringing back to the U.S., I think that, that has been dying for a couple of years now, part and parcel of the reason that we're making some investments into VSG and ESG right now because we think that we can be more competitive and get the industrial absorption of doing it ourselves to a certain extent. But we're not we're not making big strategic decisions and not making big swings, but we're always trying to adapt the supply chain. Joe, it's not changed. I mean we're constantly revisiting a variety of pieces of the portfolio. And that's really all I can say about it at the end of the day, right? We may have views on individual pieces, but we don't want that to get in the way of us extracting the maximum value that we can out of the pieces that we have. So I spent a lot of time here in terms of portfolio construction on both -- and more on the in and then the out. But we screen all of our businesses for their participation strategy and changes in the marketplace and everything else, not so much, \"Hay, wait a minute, everybody is paying a lot for things.\" So maybe we should go to market. We look at it more as in terms of its hierarchy in terms of return on invested capital in the cup and whether they are advantaged or disadvantaged structurally over the next time horizon. Yes. I mean, we're expecting big things from the retail food business this year. For sure, a lot of the deferments that happened because of COVID access and a variety of other forces are clearly what's building the backlog into '21. But having said that, we've gone through a 4.5- to 5-year cycle where there hasn't been even, we would argue, replacement or maintenance spending in terms of food retail. So there is some pent-up demand there. We think that we have a more competitive product now. We're changing the cost structure of that product.  And as we talked about before, our view is that what the customers really value in this business is being able to have the product available when they want it. And to the extent that now we've changed -- are changing the dynamic of our lead times, I think that's beginning to be reflected in our backlog. So this is expense. The management team of this business has spent 2.5 years, working real hard to transform this business. And our expectations in terms of profitability this year is material in terms of what's baked into our EPS. Yes. Nigel. I mean, look, I would expect that we are going to tighten both those changes progressively as we go through the year. But I mean, you've got your finger on it. I mean, we're predicting even if we go to the organic revenue, which doesn't have that mix, the margin does have FX in it. So we're predicting FX in advance of 12 months and predicting mix over a wide diverse portfolio in terms of gross margin. So we need to give ourselves a little bit of latitude there. As I mentioned in the previous question before, the good news is that refrigeration is coming back and in terms of absolute profits, it's going to be material to the bottom line. That's not really great in terms of consolidated conversion margin just because of the of the EBIT margin of that particular business. So if you go back to the question, I think, that was just asked before, well, could that revenue be higher?  Are we at an inflection point because there's really going to be -- and we're under forecasting refrigeration for the year. In a way, I hope we are. What that's going to do is push up the top line, but it's going to draw down the conversion margin, but we'll take the absolute profit. So it's our best guess right now. I guess, at the beginning of the year, we like to give us some latitude. I think that the history around here has been to try to hit the top, and we've caught every intention of trying to do so. It is my gut feeling. We have a President -- operating company presidents meeting as soon as we finish up with your question, and that's one of the things we're digging into. But based on what we're seeing, in our own operations and the guidance that we are giving our own operations of, if you're seeing constraints out there, you better get on the front foot and start buying components to the detriment of working capital, which we know we can bleed off of the balance of the year, let's not miss out on deliveries and production performance. So if we're doing it, my expectation is that everybody is doing it. So I think it's to the detriment of order rates through the balance of the year? No, I don't. Because I think the backed in -- look, there's always going to be volatility quarter-by-quarter. But what's baked into our revenue forecast is shipments, for lack of better word. If there's some amount of -- and look, at the end of the day, you get a backlog that's in access to your first quarter production, you're probably not going to get it out anyway. So the good news, I think when I answered sprague before is, you know what, the longer -- the bigger the backlog that we have, the more efficiently we should be able to run our factories, and that's margin accretive. Well, we did a press release on it not too long ago. So you can see our view based on what the ruling for California was. We are a leader in the systems business in Europe, and Europe is probably 3 to 5 years ahead of the United States. So we have the technology. It's now going to be a question of what the adoption rates and where they are regulatory mandated or individual retail operations want to as part of ESG go green and begin adapting those solutions. So we feel really good about our position in terms of having the technology readily available. I don't think it would be materially beneficial. Generally speaking, we've make and ship in the jurisdiction that we operate in as an overall comment. Yes. I think that if we were a big, vertically-integrated operation, yes, I think that there would be more of a challenge. We don't -- we won't bring in assemble product of any grand scale that you can break apart in containers and put value-added on that. I mean, I've been through this previous life. Yes -- look, at the end of the day, I don't think it's going to move the needle for us. The only thing that comes to mind is if we were a component part and somebody wants to source into the United States and had been sourcing -- and been importing. Is that an opportunity? I guess, sure. I wouldn't have any idea how to scale it right now, though."

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Andrey. Let\u2019s begin with the summary of results on Page 3. As we guided back in September, July, August trends were positive and we were exceeding our internal forecasts. This dynamic continued through September. In addition to the improving demand environment, we were very encouraged by our manufacturing operations and supply chain performance in the quarter. The solid operation execution had two tangible benefits in Q3. First, it increased our capacity to deliver higher volume than expected from the backlog and our long cycle businesses and as you see the positive impact to the top line. And second, through a combination of mixed and fixed cost absorption it drove a robust margin performance for the quarter. Demand trends continue to improve sequentially across most of the portfolio. The trajectory continues to vary by market and I'll talk more about that, but our diverse end market and geographic exposure is clearly an asset to us in the downturn. Revenue declined 5% organically and bookings are flat with a third of our operating companies posting positive year-over-year bookings for the quarter and more than half posting positive comparable growth in the month of September. We're not out of the woods yet, but the trajectory is encouraging and we continue to carry a healthy backlog going to the fourth quarter and into next year. We delivered strong margin performance in the quarter and year to date. We achieved margin improvement in the quarter despite lower revenue driven by our operational multi-year efficiency initiatives, gaining further traction and by improved business mix, some of which we highlighted at our recent investment day focused on the pumps and process solutions segment and biopharma business in particular. With the strong results to date, we expect to over deliver on our full-year conversion margin target and are now driving towards achieving a flat consolidated adjusted operating margin for the year. Cash flow in the quarter was strong at 17% of revenue, and 127% of adjusted net earnings. Year to date, we have generated 117 million more in free cash flow over the comparable period the last year, owing to a robust conversion management and capital discipline. As a result of our performance in the first three quarters of the year and a solid order backlog, we are raising our annual adjusted EPS guidance to [$5.40 to $5.45 per share]. We're not in the clear on the macro backdrop and performance remains uneven between markets, but we believe that our performance to date and the levers we have in our possession will enable us to [absorb] any possible dislocations in the fourth quarter should they materialize. Let's move to Slide 4. General industrial capital spending remains subdued in Q3 resulting in a 10% organic decline for an engineered products driven by softness and CapEx levered industrial automation, industrial winches, and waste handling. Additionally, our waste handling business had the largest quarter ever in the comparable period last year making it a challenging benchmark. On the positive side, aerospace and defense grew double digits on shipments from a strong backlog and we've seen robust recovery in our vehicle aftermarket business after a difficult couple of quarters. Productivity actions, cost actions, and favorable mix minimize margin erosion in the quarter nearly offsetting the impact of materially lower volumes. In fueling solutions, saw continued albeit sequentially slower growth and above-ground equipment in North America and EMV compliance and regulatory activity, whereas National Oil companies in China continued to defer capital spending amidst ongoing uncertainty. Demand for below-ground equipment has improved sequentially as construction activity restarted, but remains subdued globally. And in China, we're still weathering the roll-off of the double wall replacement mandate. Margin performance in the segment was very good and a testament to the operational focus and capability of the management team and was achieved through productivity improvements, cost controls, and favorable regional mix more than offsetting volume under absorption. Sales and imaging and identification declined 8% organically due to continued weakness in digital textile printing. We've seen improving demand for textile printing consumables. Reflecting recovering and printing volumes, however, has been insufficient to prompt fabric printers to invest in new machinery. We expect conditions to remain challenged for the balance of the year. Marking and coding was flat on strong demand for consumables and overall healthy activity in the U.S. and Asia despite lingering difficulties with customer site access and service delivery. Despite segment margins being down relative to the comparable quarter driven by digital printing volume and fixed cost absorption margin improved in marketing and coding on flat revenue as a result of the mix of effect on consumables and operational initiatives undertaken in prior periods, which also provide a solid base for incremental margins in 2021 as textiles recover. Pumps and process solutions continued to demonstrate the resilience of its product portfolio, some of which we highlighted at last month\u2019s Analyst and Investor Day. Strong growth continued in biopharma, medical, and hygienic applications. Plastics and polymers shipped several large orders from its backlog, which were initially slated to ship in Q4, getting it to a slightly positive revenue performance year-to-date. Compression components and aftermarket continue to be slower and weaker activity in the U.S. upstream and midstream. Industrial pumps activity remained below last year's volumes, but has improved sequentially. This is another quarter of exemplary margin performance in the segment, with more than 300 basis points of margin expansion driven by broad based productivity efforts cost controlled and impacted businesses, favorable mix and pricing, which more than offset lower volume in some of the portfolio. Refrigeration and food equipment posted its first quarterly organic growth since early 2019, which is a welcome sign in-line that we saw exiting the second quarter. Moreover, the recovery was broad-based. Our food and retail business, the largest in the segment, grew organically and restarted remodeling activity in supermarkets. Belvac, our can making business began shipping against its record backlog, which we believe is in the early innings of a secular growth trend. Heat exchangers were approximately flat with continued weakness in HVAC offset by strength in residential and industrial applications, including semiconductor server and medical cooling. Commercial food service improved, but margins remain impacted due to continued weakness and institutional demand from schools, and similar venues, while activity and large chains have slowly recovered. Cost actions taken earlier this year, as well as improved efficiency in volume more than offset the demand headwinds in food equipment, resulting at appreciable margin accretion. We expect to continue delivering improved comparable profits in the segment in-line with our longer-term turnaround plan. I'll pass it to Brad from here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 5. On the top is the revenue bridge. As rich mentioned in his opening remarks, our top line continues its recovery with each segment posting sequential improvement over Q2. Several of our businesses, including plastics & polymers, beverage can making and food retail return to positive organic growth in the third quarter, while biopharma continued its strong growth trajectory from prior quarters.  FX, which had been a net revenue headwind for us since mid-2018, flipped in the quarter and benefited top line by 1% or 12 million, driven principally by strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by 3 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters. The revenue breakdown by geographic area reflects sequential improvement in each major geography, but particularly encouraging is the trajectory in North America and Europe. The U.S., our largest market declined by 4% organically due to softness in waste handling industrial winches and precision components, partially offset by a strong quarter in our above ground retail fueling, marking and coating, beverage can making, and food retail businesses among others. Europe declined by 4% organically, a material improvement compared to a 19% decline in Q2 driven by constructive activity in our pumps, biopharma and hygienic, and plastics and polymer businesses. All of Asia declined 10% organically, while China representing approximately half of our business in Asia, posted an 8% year-over-year decline. We continue to face headwinds in China in retail fueling due the exploration of the underground equipment replacement mandate and slower demand from the local national [indiscernible]. Outside of retail fueling, we saw a solid growth in China. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were nearly flat down 1% organically year-over-year, compared to a 21% decline in Q2, reflecting continued momentum across our businesses. In the quarter, we saw organic declines across four segments, but sequential improvement across all segments. And a particularly strong booking for our federation of food equipment segment driven primarily by record order intake in our can making business. These orders relate to large projects that are mostly projected to ship in 2021 and 2022.  Overall, our backlog is currently approximately 200 million or 14% higher compared to this time last year, positioning us well for the remainder of the year and into 2021. Note that a material portion of the backlog increase was driven by orders in our can making business which I mentioned above. Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 6. On the top of the chart, despite a 77 million revenue decline in the quarter, we were able to keep our adjusted segment earnings approximately flat year-over-year, a testament to our proactive cost containment and productivity initiatives that help drive 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Some of the recent initiatives will continue supporting margins into 2021. Going to the bottom chart. Adjusted net earnings declined by 3 million, principally driven by higher corporate costs related to deal fees and expense accruals, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower taxes on lower earnings. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits is approximately 21.5% for the quarter, substantially the same as the prior year. Discrete tax benefits quarter-over-quarter were approximately 2 million lower in 2020. Right sizing and other costs were 6 million in the quarter relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into this year. Now on Slide 7. We are pleased with the cash performance with year-to-date free cash flow of 563 million, a 117 million or [indiscernible] last year. Our teams have done a good job managing capital more actively in this uncertain environment. And with the improving sequential revenue trajectory in the third quarter, we rebuilt some working capital to support the businesses and our customers. Free cash flow now stands at 11.5% of revenue year today, going into the fourth quarter, which traditionally has been our strongest cash flow quarter of the year. With that, let me turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks Brad. I\u2019m on Page 8. Let's go segment by segment. In Engineered Products, we accept similar performance as the third quarter vehicle aftermarket had a very good Q3 as the business is able to deliver on pent up demand. Notably, we have a tough comp in Q4 due to some promotional campaigns, but this is a business which has excellent prospects for 2021. Activity in waste handling is picking up with private haulers, but orders placed are mostly for 2021. We expect Municipal volume to remain subdued for the balance of the year. Demand is reaccelerating for digital solutions in the space and overall we are constructive on the outlook for this business into 2021. We are seeing some encouraging signs and industrial automation and automotive OEM markets in particular in October. Aerospace and defense continues to be steady, most of what we plan to deliver in the next quarter is in the segments backlogs. We don't expect material upside and/or downside from our forecasts. We expect margin to be modestly impacted by volume and negative mix relative to Q3 largely due to demand seasonality. Fueling solutions remain constructive finishing the year and into 2021. As we've been guiding all year, we have a tough comp in Q4 due to record volumes in the comparable period. Despite the top line headwinds, we expect to hold year-over-year absolute adjusted operating profit as a result of our efforts done on product line harmonization productivity and pricing discipline. We expect 2021 to be a good year as demand trends remain constructive for our above ground and software solution businesses and we turn the corner on below ground fluid transfer and vehicle wash. Imaging and ID\u2019s remain steady. We saw robust activity in marking and coding exiting the third quarter and the backlog in the business is higher than last year. Activity and serialization software space is also picking up nicely. In digital print, demand for inks has picked up, which is a sign of improving printing volumes. We are seeing a pickup in quotations for new machines, but we expect a few more quarters before we returned to normal levels in this market. In Pumps & Process Solutions, we expect current trends to continue the biopharma plastics and processing continue [indiscernible] trajectory in pumps recovering to more normal levels, particularly in defense and select industrial applications. Compression product lines within the precision components exposed to mid-and-downstream are likely to see continued weaknesses in Q4 as projects and maintenance continue to be deferred. Overall, the pumps and process solutions outlook is supported by segment backlog that is aligned with what we had at this point last year. Let's get on to the last segment Refrigeration & Food Equipment. First, as said we are in the early innings what we believe to be a multi-year secular build-out of can making capacity, as evidenced by our backlog driven by the transition from plastic to aluminum containers and also the spike in demand for cans at home consumption of food and beverages. In food retail we deliver low teens margin for Q3 converting on our backlog providing us a baseline to reach our 2021 margin aspirations. Our backlog is beginning to build moving into 2021. As you all know, this is a seasonal business. So, Q4 volume and fixed cost absorption declines in Q4. And frankly it's all about 2021 from here and Q3 was a sign of good progress. We have a robust backlog and heat exchanges and are constructive in this market. Our capacity expansion projects are being completed and we have some interesting new products in the pipe. Finally, in commercial food service, large chain should continue to support activity, but will not fully offset weakness on the institutional side. Overall for the segment, comparable profits and margins for the segment are forecasted to be up in Q4 into the comparable period. With strong margin performance to date, we intend to deliver approximately flat year-over-year adjusted margin this year, despite a lower revenue base. As you may recall, we entered the year with a program entailing $50 million in structural cross reductions as part of our multi-year program highlighted at our 2019 Investor Day. We [action more] structural initiatives, which resulted in approximately $75 million of permanent cost reduction in 2020, leaving a $25 million annualized carryover benefit into 2021. We view this as a down payment on the 2021 portion of our multi-year margin improvement journey. And we'll update that with more to come on 2021 when we report the fourth quarter. We expect robust cash flow this year on the back of solid year to date cash flow generation and target free cash flow margin at the upper end of our guidance between 11% and 12%. Capital expenditures should tally up to approximately $159 for the year, with most of the larger outlays behind us. In summation, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.45 per share for the full year above the top end range of our prior guidance. We remain on the front foot in capital deployment posture with several bolt-ons closed last quarter. We have multiple opportunities in the hopper, and we hope to report on those soon. And as usual before wrapping up, I want to thank everybody at Dover for their work and continued perseverance in these uneasy times. And with that, Andrey, let's go to the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys, good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi Steve.\nBrad Cerepak: Hey Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just trying to reconcile the kind of 4Q guide here, I mean, I didn't really hear when you walked through the segments, there wasn't really anything that suggested that, you know, any one of these segments or at least in total are going to be down materially year-over-year. Yet I think your, you know 4Q guide implies a decline in EPS. And I understand tax rates going to be a little bit higher, maybe that's like $0.07 or $0.08, but is there anything that we're missing there? I mean, refrigeration is usually the most seasonal and the backlog there was like, you know, pretty [eye poppingly] strong. So, anything we're missing or is this just a bit of conservatism?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I would have hoped that when we did the Investor Day in the middle of the quarter that we were pretty forthright of what we thought the Q3 was going to be. And we would have hoped that estimates for Q3 would have moved up and that Q4 would have moved down and we've got neither. So here comes the Q3 is great, but Q4 is going to be a [myth, a narrative]. \nSteve Tusa: That's not from me, just to be clear.\nRichard Tobin: No, that was a general comment. That was not aimed at you at all. So look, you know, we have a bad comp and DFS, which we've been highlighting all year, just because of the fact that if you recall, we had a bunch of orders last year. We had some operational issues in the Q3. So, we shipped a ton in Q4, that's always been hanging out there. We over delivered to our this year's forecast in vehicle services group, which is a lot of the reason that we did a lot better in Q3.  So, if you think about automotive aftermarket, we had a couple really poor quarters. We had a lot of pent-up demand. I think operationally we hit the ball out of the park and delivered and over delivered what we'd expect our forecast to be. So that gives us sort of a negative comp going into Q4. Despite the backlog and refrigeration, I think I would caution you on the segment backlog while we're building backlog and refrigeration for [2021 deliveries] that backlog figure is materially impacted by the backlog that we have at Belvac, which is over $200 million worth of deliveries.  So, you know, and finally, you know, we're still getting COVID reports, particularly in Europe. So, I think there is an amount of prudence about, you know, are we going to have to take facilities down? Are certain regions of Europe going to be impacted from a demand cycle? So, I don't think it's bad news at all, quite frankly, in some of our higher CapEx businesses, like waste management, we're getting orders for 2021. Clearly, we could build that product and get the industrial absorption, but I've got absolute confidence in our management team, that let's manage our inventory in Q4, and we start up next year with high build rate. So overall, is there some conservatism in there? Sure, there is and that, until we get on the other side of this COVID issue, will continue to operate under that stance, but is there anything going on in terms of any particular market getting worse from the trajectory that it's on now? Absolutely not.\nSteve Tusa: Yeah. Just a specific follow up on that. I think you said hold year-over-year absolute profit in your comments at DFS for 4Q, does that mean that's flat or was that just, hey, we'll hold it within a range? And then just to be clear on Belvac, is that still a, you know, pretty profitable business?\nRichard Tobin: The absolute profit comment was for the full-year of DFS. So, margin benefit outweighs top line decrease.\nSteve Tusa: Okay.\nRichard Tobin: And on Belvac, it is accretive to the segment margins. We are beginning to do a transition to a higher mix of turnkey projects. So, there's some pass through revenue. So, I think it'd be a little bit careful about the assumptions of Belvac, but we'll take it because, quite frankly, it's approved \u2013 it's accretive to the segment for sure.\nSteve Tusa: Right. Okay. That's it. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hi Scott.\nBrad Cerepak : Good morning.\nScott Davis: Richard didn't talk about M&A markets at all in your prepared remarks, I just wonder if there's a bit of an update on either activity out there that you're seeing or opportunities or valuation or anything you might share with us.\nRichard Tobin: It's not a lot different than it was at the end of Q2. I mean there are some opportunities out there. Valuation continues to be reflective of the public markets. So, despite, you know, every, you know, even private companies are trying to see through the downturn of 2020 and want to be paid on 2021. So, it's pricey out there. A lot of competition in terms of private equity, but having said all that, on some of the more [niche opportunities] that we have, we're feeling good about some of those opportunities there. Some of which we highlighted during the Pumps & Process Solutions day that we did mid-month. So you know, we've got a pretty good list of candidates, but we're not going to overpay. And you know, and I think that some of these deals are taking longer because as you can imagine, due diligence under pandemic is a bit difficult.\nScott Davis: I'm sure it is. So, just moving on, I\u2019m kind of curious on your opinion on capital spending, you know, there's a lot of uncertainty out there, you got a election, you got pandemic that, you know that, obviously, in the middle of \u2013 but at the same time, money's cheap. And, you know, no better time to invest ahead of a recovery, I suppose. So, are your customers delaying capital spending? Is this kind of a normal down cycle response? And we'll see a quick recovery or do you think there's any sense that things could be a little bit different, and people delay a little bit further, just given perhaps higher corporate tax rates and other noise that's out there?\nRichard Tobin: Look, I guess my overall comment is there's a bit of seasonality. And I'm just not going to do the project in Q4 because I can do it in Q1 of next year. The general commentary if I exclude kind of some of our businesses like textile digital print, which has some secular headwinds associated with it, which are particular, what we're hearing from our customers is a desire to spend in 2021 on productivity CapEx, which generally speaking is, makes up about 85% of our portfolio. So, going into 2021 as you can imagine, we\u2019re beginning to start to do the forecasting and the budget. You know, we feel good about a lot of our businesses. I think it \u2013 like if you take something like waste handling right now, the municipalities are going to sit on their hands now until they see what their budgets are for 2021, but on the private sector, we just think that we could build off our backlog now if we want, but I don't think there's any reason to do so, and we'll hold our powder dry, manage our working capital, and come out at the beginning of the year at high build rates.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you, Rich. Good luck.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hi. Two things, Rich. First on pumps, I mean, the margins were extraordinary. You mentioned a little bit of, I think, revenue pulled forward. You know, was there some kind of additional mix or volume dynamic there? And how should we think about the margins in this segment going forward?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, there \u2013 I think we got to be careful about promising margin accretion from here. I guess we just take it in absolute revenue growth. But look, my comments on the quarter was on the long-cycle side, which is particularly [MOG]. Timing those revenues is always difficult because of the size of the orders and you're dealing with letters of credits and a variety of things. But my opening commentary, as a general statement, I think that the operational performance of the Group in Q3 was excellent. I think that we're really beginning to get some traction and this is across the portfolio. In terms of what we've been working on, on operational efficiency and supply chain, and look, MOG built the product, it was ready to go and we were paid and out the door it goes. So \u2013 and that, generally speaking, is margin accretive, and you couple that with the fact that the trajectory on the biopharma side continues on and you get the margin performance that you see here. \nJeff Sprague: Interesting. And then, maybe a two-parter on DRFE, if I could, actually? So, we're seeing actually, you know, very strong results out of some of the food retailers, Albertsons today, actually. Is there any particular, you know, unusual issue with access at this point? Obviously, we've got seasonality, but you know, how do you see that playing out? And then, just a little bit more on Belvac, are you just seeing, kind of \u2013 I don't know, kind of conceptually, I guess the switch being flipped on, you know, plastic, you know, to aluminum, did something really dramatically change in the thinking of your customer base here?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. Let's deal with Belvac first, I\u2019ll flip the answer. Capacity has been extremely tight. It was tight in 2019, and then, COVID flipped it over in terms of the demand function. Think about beer, right? No one's consuming keg beer, it's all flipped into cans, so there's been a surge in terms of can demand. And if you go look at some of the bottlers, they've been [indiscernible] about canned pricing for some time, so here comes the capacity wave. These are big projects, so the planning period to get them up and going. We've known about them coming, I would say for a year now, but I think that COVID really drove the demand. So you've got the COVID issue in terms of the transition to kind of more at home, if you will. Overarching all that, you have this issue with PET and recyclability and a variety of other things. So that's why, you know, you've got a pull forward in terms of this massive capacity expansion being announced, which is driven by the shorter-term demand cycle. But I think that the can-makers would tell you that they believe it's secular because they think that they have an advantage from an environmental point of view. So, for us, we think that this is, you know, two to three years minimum, in terms of the secular trend for us, in particular on the machinery side. Back to refrigeration, look, we expected this year to be better. I know it's a low bar in terms of the demand function and we got negatively impacted by COVID because of access rights and everything else. We ran a capacity in Q3. As I mentioned my comments, we did low teens margin for the refrigeration piece of the business, which is a good harbinger in terms of what we're capable of doing, level loaded. Q4, it's all about there's a seasonality portion of this business. You generally don't do store refurbishments going into the Christmas season because I think it's going to be a stay-at-home Christmas, clearly. So, they're going to protect their infrastructure. But we are beginning to build a backlog for 2021 delivery now, so you'll see some under absorption in Q4, but as I mentioned in my comments, it's all about 2021 for us here.\nJeff Sprague: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. You mentioned just now, Rich, it's all about 2021 and fully agree, maybe on that point, you know, Slide 9, I suppose, you know, you give a little bit of color on the \u2013 you know, the cost savings and that $25 million carry over into next year. Just clarify perhaps that \u2013 you know, there'll be extra cost saving measures on top of that that we probably hear about a Q4 earnings. And also, any way to size the return of some of those temporary cost-outs that are not semi-permanent, you know, just to try and understand any magnitude on that for next year?\nRichard Tobin: To your first question, we said that we were going \u2013 we were \u2013 it was a three-year program, a $50 million a year. We've pulled forward $20 million to $25 million into this year, so you get a calendarized carry over. But the fact of the matter is, we've got enough in the pipe that we're confident that we'll get the $50 million, and to the extent that we can work hard on it, we'll get kind of the roll forward of the calendarization carried forward in 2021. That's what I can say about in terms of absolute structural cost takeout.  On the temporary side, I think that we need to be careful because a lot of the temporary was based under furlough legislation that was available, okay. And that is going to be dependent on revenue and volume, so let's kind of put that aside for a moment. The rest of what we can call temporary or controllable is in the SG&A side. Look, at the end of the day, we would hope to build back comp, so that's a headwind, but I think that's important for morale around here. But on the other hand, clearly, on [T&E] and some of the other things, I do not expect us to come back to 2019 levels, no matter what the revenue profile is for 2021. So look, at the end of the day, Julian, it\u2019s going to be embedded in whatever guidance we give you for 2021, but we don't expect a full snapback to kind of 2019 comp SG&A levels.\nJulian Mitchell: I understand. And anything, Rich, you could remind us on around kind of normal operating leverage that we should expect at Dover assuming next year revenues are up, but not dramatically, let\u2019s say?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, its \u2013 look, we have a wide range of margin profiles between the businesses and depending on what the starting point is, then the leverage is going to be different. So \u2013 and, you know, you heard the question before about pumps and process solution, I think it's fair to say that you're not going to get a lot of fixed cost absorption out of that particular segment, but any revenue that we get at current gross margins is going to be highly accretive. So, we look at it that way for that particular business, as opposed to digital textile printing, where you've had a very difficult time this year. We think that the operational leverage, when that comes back, is going to be in excess of gross margin level. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag depending on the current trajectory between 2020 and 2021.\nJulian Mitchell: That makes sense. And maybe just on the revenue line then for next year. DFS, I think you'd mentioned a good outlook for next year, but I suppose that the bookings, you know, have been tough for two quarters, probably tough again in Q4, and you have those question marks around U.S. EMV that always get brought up. So, you know, maybe don't focus too much on that specific piece, but maybe help remind us why you feel good about the DFS topline next year?\nRichard Tobin: I'm glad you asked that question because as we mentioned, we did the Investor Day for Pumps & Process Solutions that we were going to do another one this year, we'll be announcing shortly another virtual Investor Day, which we will concentrate on the Fueling Solutions business and hopefully answer all your questions about 2021 trajectory and what we think the strengths of that business is.\nJulian Mitchell: Understood. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citi Group.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Rich, can you give us more color into the progress you've been making in Refrigeration in terms of margin? At one point before the pandemic, you talked about hitting that 15%. You did have double-digit margin in the quarter for the first time in over a year. But looking out into 2021, have you seen enough from them in terms of execution in that segment and what you have in backlog? You talked about Belvac, so you get continued sort of nice margin improvement and you can hit those goals that you set for yourself?\nRichard Tobin: We're not all the way there yet. We're not getting the benefits of the automation in terms of the labor content, so we actually got to low-teens margin in the quarter without that. So, everything's pointing up. I think it is purely going to be a function of the demand profile of the business for 2021. What we can see right now or what we hear from our customer, I think it's going to be proactive for 2021. So meaning it looks like barring another wave of COVID, that revenue should rise for Refrigeration next year and we'll get the benefit of both the productivity and the operational leverage. So, you know, we're not \u2013 it's not all in the bag yet, but we're cautiously optimistic based on what we've seen in Q3 and I would not panic about Q4, just because of the negative leverage that we're always going to get in that segment. Like I said, it's all about 2021 from here.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Got it. And then, Rich, you mentioned, you're going to have that DFS Analyst Day, but if you step back, I mean, you have 14% backlog growth as you mentioned, you sound pretty constructive about 2021. So as you look out, are there any businesses other than DFS that you're more worried about? Or do you actually have pretty good backup visibility at this point, maybe even better than average toward growth in most of your segments in 2021?\nRichard Tobin : We worry about them all. But I think I mentioned a few. I think that we've been proactively prudent in ESG by cutting capacity early just because of this municipal issue, so we would expect to carry some negative leverage from 2020 into positive leverage in 2021. We feel really good about vehicle services group for 2021 [faced on] mostly \u2013 you know, the amount of miles driven, the amount of used cars that are out in the fleet and I think that management has got a lot of really great productivity initiatives in the pipe coming there. Let's see, I mean, I don't want to go through them all one by one. Refrigeration, we talked about. You know, we'll be cautious on digital printing, that's probably going to be a second half of 2021 in terms of the upturn. And look at if \u2013 and if Pumps & Process Solutions just can continue that trajectory that they're on, that is absolutely satisfactory. So, you know, we're not out of the woods. You know, we've got some business in terms that are highly leveraged towards CapEx. It's a little bit of a wait and see, but, you know, we're in the process of doing 2021 forecasts and we feel good about the demand function and we feel good about the rollover of our productivity initiatives going into next year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it, guys. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Rich, picking up on the answer on Refrigeration, so kind of went back over some notes here, I think originally, you had said the food retail automation project was going to reduce labor hours by 50%. You're going to cut SKUs from 400 to less than 100. You were talking about dramatic declines in base permutations. Have those objectives been realized? And you mentioned that the \u2013 you know, the 50% labor wasn't really necessarily in that, so does that mean that that's on the [come because] it's a matter of timing or perhaps the parameters for expectations or cost-out or whatever changed, just any kind of more color on that automation project would be helpful?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. I mean, we are slightly behind in terms of the automation just because that we couldn't get contract or access for a period of time into our site, so that kind of gummed up the process a little bit. We're making good progress in terms of SKU management, but that is also a function of the demand cycle and somewhat a function of us getting the automation up because you need to kind of sell the benefits of the automation to your customer because those are the ones that you're convincing to change the SKUs at the end of the day. So look, I think that we're probably \u2013 you know, taking Q3 into account, we're halfway where we would expect it would have been under a more normal 2020 conditions. I guess that I can answer it that way.\nJohn Inch: No, that makes sense. Assuming that the demand trajectory continues, where do you get to the point where you say, all right, automation is done and now you're getting the full bore of the cost benefit or the productivity drivers toward, say, variable contribution from future volume uplift? Is that sometime mid-next year or perhaps a little earlier?\nRichard Tobin: It would be \u2013 this is \u2013 you know, it's a bit of a reverse barbell, so it would be Q2 and Q3 of 2021 where we would expect to see the tangible benefits.\nJohn Inch: Okay. And then, I did want to ask you about Wayne Tokheim. You know, [indiscernible] just went public and they talked about 2020 is the peak year for EMV. You talked about EMV being strong this quarter as they did. I'm curious if you would concur with that? So 2021 is an absolute revenue drop off and strategically is Wayne Tokheim considering, say, branching into electric vehicle infrastructure to diversify the petroleum footprint to a greater extent? I know, you've got this alliance with ChargePoint. It doesn't look like there's a revenue or profit sharing mechanism with that, but what are your thoughts, Rich, just strategically on and I realize [EV] is very far out, but, you know, markets discount the stuff and worry about it sooner versus later? Like, how are you thinking about it [indiscernible]?\nRichard Tobin: John, I don't want to take away from all of the effort that the management team is undertaking right now to prepare for this Investor Day in November, which should answer all of the questions that you just asked. I think that the only thing that I will say that there was some talk about sizing the headwind for 2021. I would caution you that EMV is a North American phenomenon and our exposure in terms of the North American market is different than \u2013 so I think you have to size that appropriately and that our product mix between above-ground and below-ground is significantly different. You know, we've been carrying around a pretty weak below ground market this year, right? We had talked about the headwind on [doubled-wall] for China when we gave the guidance for this year, but then, you ran into COVID with access rights and construction and everything else. So, you know, at the end of the day, sure, margins are up. Some of that is driven by EMV demand for sure, but I don't want to take away from the productivity improvement that the management has done here that has driven margin accretion despite the topline. So, what our thoughts are in 2021, I'll leave it to November. When we get to it is that the EMV headwind is manageable to the extent that the below-ground business returns to growth in 2021.\nJohn Inch: Perfect and I'll leave the EV stuff for the Investor Day. Thanks again.\nRichard Tobin: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question and it's sort of been asked in different format, but how do you think of the businesses that are doing well? How much will be sustainable in 2021? But just trying to see as things normalize, do you think businesses mean revert i.e., things have been doing well and during COVID sort of get a little bit weaker and things that, you know, were weak, get stronger or do you see structural changes in the longer-term growth rates within your portfolio post COVID?\nRichard Tobin: Let's see here, look, the only business that we have that if tangibly benefiting from COVID today would be biopharma, but that is a business \u2013 I think we sized it up for you. I mean, look, it's great. It's growing fantastically. The margins are terrific, but it's not overly materially weighted in the portfolio and that's the one that's benefiting. I mean, all this \u2013 you know, Belvac is going to benefit, but we believe that that is more structural than COVID-related just because of this issue of recyclability and moving away from PET. So, you know, we don't think that we have a COVID tailwind embedded anywhere on our business, so it's purely a question of the ones that are suffering, the portions of the portfolio are suffering, which ones are coming back. I think it's fair to say that the one that we're taking a close look like is that our compression business, which is the one that's levered most to midstream and downstream, whether that demand in terms of CapEx or maintenance remains subdued in 2021 or not. But again, that is not overly significant to the portfolio and we can weather the storm. So, you know, our expectation is that the parts of the portfolio that are doing reasonably well will continue to do so and the ones that have been under more pressure will come back on different trajectories based on their end markets.\nAndrew Obin: Alright, thank you. And just a follow-up question on and I apologize if it\u2019s been asked, I've been getting disconnected. On textile printing, on the printing and ID, textile printing CapEx, you highlighted it, you know, digital printing, sort of weakness. Given the strength in consumer spending, just a little bit surprised that this business would be weak, can you just provide more detail as to what's happening there?\nRichard Tobin: I wouldn't consider it to be weak. I mean, revenues were flat\u2026\nAndrew Obin: Okay. \nRichard Tobin : \u2026and margin was up. I mean, yeah, the consumable business is tracking right with consumer goods, which is great. I mean, the printer business and the service business is still a bit choppy because that still requires access rights\u2026\nAndrew Obin: Okay, okay. \nRichard Tobin : \u2026and customer locations and everything else.\nAndrew Obin: So, it's pretty straightforward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, Rich, how do we think about the backlog conversion in Refrigeration and Food Equipment? And the reason I asked the question is, if you go back to like the \u2013 you know, few years ago, you know, 2015, 2018, its pretty \u2013 is a pretty one-for-one type of relationship between your orders and your revenue. And so, clearly, you know, in 2019 and in 2020, orders are much better than what your revenue run rate and I know part of that is the automation project. But like, how do I think about like the length of the backlog and how that converts over the next couple of years?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Let me think about this. We are \u2013 look, we give segmental backlogs and I think that we size the portion of Belvac that's in there, which distorts that backlog because somewhat. You know, the Refrigeration business in particular is relatively short cycle. So, to the extent that we're getting orders for 2021 is actually early. Now, well, it would have been early, let's call it a month ago, which is a good sign because it's \u2013 generally speaking, food retailers don't kind of secure capacity. They just believe that that markets have been over capacities forever, so they just place the orders and you run through hoops to deliver it to them. So, I think the good news is based on what our customers are saying about their own CapEx and maintenance programs that we expect it to be up in 2021. And the other good data point is, is that we're getting orders for 2021 now, which is technically early, a little bit early, so that's the good news, but I wouldn't try to disaggregate our segmental backlog because you've got Belvac in there and it's very material.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then I guess maybe just kind of the one follow-on question would be just around like capital deployment. I know that you guys, you know, reinstituted the buyback last quarter. It didn't seem like you guys did much this quarter. How are you guys thinking about that versus \u2013 you know, you mentioned, you know, [$200 million to $500 million] type deals like where are you kind of like prioritizing your investment right now?\nRichard Tobin: We're still prioritizing on the inorganic. We had to walk away from one in the quarter because of \u2013 for particular issues that would have been an outlay in excess of $300 million, so that has changed plans a little bit. Look, at the end of the day, it's a wait and see. We've got a decent pipeline. We'd like to convert that free cash into inorganic investment. But we're not just going to do deals to deploy the capital, right? They have to be smart and they have to be within the parameters that we've laid out. And if not, then we'll revisit capital return and I'm sure that will be a discussion. We have the board meeting next week.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, good to know. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. \nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBrad Cerepak: Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground already. But, Rich, I want to come back to another comment earlier on the backlog and kind of the visibility into the first quarter first half relative to normal. How would you size that? I mean, clearly, you know, I think you're trying to focus people on the comfort with 2021 over 4Q. I totally get that. Any way to put some guidelines around, you know proportional visibility this time of the year versus what you would normally have?\nRichard Tobin: I think that we talked about Refrigeration at length and we've talked about Belvac that we've seen there. On our longer cycle businesses MOG, comes to mind DPC, to a certain extent. We would expect to deplete backlog in the second half of the year as, you know, bigger projects roll off and then you build it up. We shipped heavily off of that backlog in MOG and it's not as if we're falling into a hole. So, I think the good news about MOG is, is that despite heavy shipments in Q3, that backlog is not depleting at a high rate, which is \u2013 and that's all 2021 just because of the delivery times in those particular businesses. The balance of the portfolio outside of digital printing is, generally speaking, short cycle.  I mentioned vehicle service group who had an excellent quarter in terms of shipments and operational performance. They've got a little bit of a bad comp in Q4 just because they are running some promotional things last year prior to price increases, but what we're seeing in terms of dealer communication there is very good for 2021. So, I think it's anecdotal, so there's no real general comment for our portfolio this wide, but you know, I think that we're \u2013 the signaling we're getting for 2021 overall is perspective.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. So it's not just a phenomenon where, hey, 4Q is a little weaker and January is awesome, but we don't know anything else about 2021 and [indiscernible]?\nRichard Tobin: As I mentioned before, I mean, you think about like a business like ESG, right? If they've got backlog for 2021 deliveries, we could make the product in Q4, which positive absorption, negative working capital. I've got confidence in that business to build that product in 2021 and meet the delivery date. So, to us, as we've always done around here, Q4 is about cash generation and setting ourselves up for 2021.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then I noticed another automation project announced in precision components, any more, I guess, kind of, you know, spread of automation or, you know, kind of evangelizing some of the technology out there across the portfolio that we should expect beyond precision components? And I guess Refrigeration, is that something that could be kind of the next wave of cost reduction?\nRichard Tobin: There's a few of our businesses that lend themselves to increased automation. As we mentioned, during the Pumps and Process Solution Virtual Investor Day that our expectation is to get on a cadence of doing more of those rather than the tour de force on the portfolio. So, one of the things that we're discussing is we have two big projects, one of which is completed in vehicle services group and one that is under construction around that that we would expect is a candidate to do some more investor outreach in Q1 of 2021.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Right, thanks. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Your final question today will come from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. There's not a whole lot to run through here, but just go back to Belvac, you know, is the [trends] seen in, you know, in can manufacturing is \u2013 the flip side of that, that we face some structural headwinds in chemicals plastics, polymers going forward, you know, so therefore some of the weakness we've seen in [indiscernible] is more structural than just typical?\nRichard Tobin: You know, Nigel, I'm sure when I talk about Belvac, the guys at Belvac listen and chuckle to themselves how little I know about can making. So, for me to bridge that over into the chemical world on PET, I think you're going to have to ask somebody else. Based on what we hear from our customers, both the can makers on the machinery and from the bottlers in terms of the design portion of the can making, we believe that there's a structural change underway, how that impacts PET demand, I\u2019ll leave it up to the chemical producers to answer that.\nNigel Coe: Fair enough. That's a good answer. And then, just quickly on the heat exchangers. I think you sell into both commercial and industrial markets, I think you caught up couple of times, you know, you've seen uptick in heat exchangers where specifically you see enough strength in the markets?\nRichard Tobin: More on the heat pump side than anything else. That's where our particular strength is and that is where we are in the midst of completing some material capacity expansions. If you know anything about that market, the size of these heat exchangers is getting very large because these are pretty huge systems that are being installed specially on the back of European legislation. So that's really where the demand function for us is coming from.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 5. On the top is the revenue bridge. As rich mentioned in his opening remarks, our top line continues its recovery with each segment posting sequential improvement over Q2. Several of our businesses, including plastics & polymers, beverage can making and food retail return to positive organic growth in the third quarter, while biopharma continued its strong growth trajectory from prior quarters.  FX, which had been a net revenue headwind for us since mid-2018, flipped in the quarter and benefited top line by 1% or 12 million, driven principally by strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by 3 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters. The revenue breakdown by geographic area reflects sequential improvement in each major geography, but particularly encouraging is the trajectory in North America and Europe. The U.S., our largest market declined by 4% organically due to softness in waste handling industrial winches and precision components, partially offset by a strong quarter in our above ground retail fueling, marking and coating, beverage can making, and food retail businesses among others. Europe declined by 4% organically, a material improvement compared to a 19% decline in Q2 driven by constructive activity in our pumps, biopharma and hygienic, and plastics and polymer businesses. All of Asia declined 10% organically, while China representing approximately half of our business in Asia, posted an 8% year-over-year decline. We continue to face headwinds in China in retail fueling due the exploration of the underground equipment replacement mandate and slower demand from the local national [indiscernible]. Outside of retail fueling, we saw a solid growth in China. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were nearly flat down 1% organically year-over-year, compared to a 21% decline in Q2, reflecting continued momentum across our businesses. In the quarter, we saw organic declines across four segments, but sequential improvement across all segments. And a particularly strong booking for our federation of food equipment segment driven primarily by record order intake in our can making business. These orders relate to large projects that are mostly projected to ship in 2021 and 2022.  Overall, our backlog is currently approximately 200 million or 14% higher compared to this time last year, positioning us well for the remainder of the year and into 2021. Note that a material portion of the backlog increase was driven by orders in our can making business which I mentioned above. Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 6. On the top of the chart, despite a 77 million revenue decline in the quarter, we were able to keep our adjusted segment earnings approximately flat year-over-year, a testament to our proactive cost containment and productivity initiatives that help drive 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Some of the recent initiatives will continue supporting margins into 2021. Going to the bottom chart. Adjusted net earnings declined by 3 million, principally driven by higher corporate costs related to deal fees and expense accruals, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower taxes on lower earnings. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits is approximately 21.5% for the quarter, substantially the same as the prior year. Discrete tax benefits quarter-over-quarter were approximately 2 million lower in 2020. Right sizing and other costs were 6 million in the quarter relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into this year. Now on Slide 7. We are pleased with the cash performance with year-to-date free cash flow of 563 million, a 117 million or [indiscernible] last year. Our teams have done a good job managing capital more actively in this uncertain environment. And with the improving sequential revenue trajectory in the third quarter, we rebuilt some working capital to support the businesses and our customers. Free cash flow now stands at 11.5% of revenue year today, going into the fourth quarter, which traditionally has been our strongest cash flow quarter of the year. With that, let me turn it back to Rich. Hey Steve. Good morning. Good morning."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrey. Let's begin with the summary of results on Page 3. As we guided back in September, July, August trends were positive and we were exceeding our internal forecasts. This dynamic continued through September. In addition to the improving demand environment, we were very encouraged by our manufacturing operations and supply chain performance in the quarter. The solid operation execution had two tangible benefits in Q3. First, it increased our capacity to deliver higher volume than expected from the backlog and our long cycle businesses and as you see the positive impact to the top line. And second, through a combination of mixed and fixed cost absorption it drove a robust margin performance for the quarter. Demand trends continue to improve sequentially across most of the portfolio. The trajectory continues to vary by market and I'll talk more about that, but our diverse end market and geographic exposure is clearly an asset to us in the downturn. Revenue declined 5% organically and bookings are flat with a third of our operating companies posting positive year-over-year bookings for the quarter and more than half posting positive comparable growth in the month of September. We're not out of the woods yet, but the trajectory is encouraging and we continue to carry a healthy backlog going to the fourth quarter and into next year. We delivered strong margin performance in the quarter and year to date. We achieved margin improvement in the quarter despite lower revenue driven by our operational multi-year efficiency initiatives, gaining further traction and by improved business mix, some of which we highlighted at our recent investment day focused on the pumps and process solutions segment and biopharma business in particular. With the strong results to date, we expect to over deliver on our full-year conversion margin target and are now driving towards achieving a flat consolidated adjusted operating margin for the year. Cash flow in the quarter was strong at 17% of revenue, and 127% of adjusted net earnings. Year to date, we have generated 117 million more in free cash flow over the comparable period the last year, owing to a robust conversion management and capital discipline. As a result of our performance in the first three quarters of the year and a solid order backlog, we are raising our annual adjusted EPS guidance to [$5.40 to $5.45 per share]. We're not in the clear on the macro backdrop and performance remains uneven between markets, but we believe that our performance to date and the levers we have in our possession will enable us to [absorb] any possible dislocations in the fourth quarter should they materialize. Let's move to Slide 4. General industrial capital spending remains subdued in Q3 resulting in a 10% organic decline for an engineered products driven by softness and CapEx levered industrial automation, industrial winches, and waste handling. Additionally, our waste handling business had the largest quarter ever in the comparable period last year making it a challenging benchmark. On the positive side, aerospace and defense grew double digits on shipments from a strong backlog and we've seen robust recovery in our vehicle aftermarket business after a difficult couple of quarters. Productivity actions, cost actions, and favorable mix minimize margin erosion in the quarter nearly offsetting the impact of materially lower volumes. In fueling solutions, saw continued albeit sequentially slower growth and above-ground equipment in North America and EMV compliance and regulatory activity, whereas National Oil companies in China continued to defer capital spending amidst ongoing uncertainty. Demand for below-ground equipment has improved sequentially as construction activity restarted, but remains subdued globally. And in China, we're still weathering the roll-off of the double wall replacement mandate. Margin performance in the segment was very good and a testament to the operational focus and capability of the management team and was achieved through productivity improvements, cost controls, and favorable regional mix more than offsetting volume under absorption. Sales and imaging and identification declined 8% organically due to continued weakness in digital textile printing. We've seen improving demand for textile printing consumables. Reflecting recovering and printing volumes, however, has been insufficient to prompt fabric printers to invest in new machinery. We expect conditions to remain challenged for the balance of the year. Marking and coding was flat on strong demand for consumables and overall healthy activity in the U.S. and Asia despite lingering difficulties with customer site access and service delivery. Despite segment margins being down relative to the comparable quarter driven by digital printing volume and fixed cost absorption margin improved in marketing and coding on flat revenue as a result of the mix of effect on consumables and operational initiatives undertaken in prior periods, which also provide a solid base for incremental margins in 2021 as textiles recover. Pumps and process solutions continued to demonstrate the resilience of its product portfolio, some of which we highlighted at last month's Analyst and Investor Day. Strong growth continued in biopharma, medical, and hygienic applications. Plastics and polymers shipped several large orders from its backlog, which were initially slated to ship in Q4, getting it to a slightly positive revenue performance year-to-date. Compression components and aftermarket continue to be slower and weaker activity in the U.S. upstream and midstream. Industrial pumps activity remained below last year's volumes, but has improved sequentially. This is another quarter of exemplary margin performance in the segment, with more than 300 basis points of margin expansion driven by broad based productivity efforts cost controlled and impacted businesses, favorable mix and pricing, which more than offset lower volume in some of the portfolio. Refrigeration and food equipment posted its first quarterly organic growth since early 2019, which is a welcome sign in-line that we saw exiting the second quarter. Moreover, the recovery was broad-based. Our food and retail business, the largest in the segment, grew organically and restarted remodeling activity in supermarkets. Belvac, our can making business began shipping against its record backlog, which we believe is in the early innings of a secular growth trend. Heat exchangers were approximately flat with continued weakness in HVAC offset by strength in residential and industrial applications, including semiconductor server and medical cooling. Commercial food service improved, but margins remain impacted due to continued weakness and institutional demand from schools, and similar venues, while activity and large chains have slowly recovered. Cost actions taken earlier this year, as well as improved efficiency in volume more than offset the demand headwinds in food equipment, resulting at appreciable margin accretion. We expect to continue delivering improved comparable profits in the segment in-line with our longer-term turnaround plan. I'll pass it to Brad from here. Thanks Brad. I'm on Page 8. Let's go segment by segment. In Engineered Products, we accept similar performance as the third quarter vehicle aftermarket had a very good Q3 as the business is able to deliver on pent up demand. Notably, we have a tough comp in Q4 due to some promotional campaigns, but this is a business which has excellent prospects for 2021. Activity in waste handling is picking up with private haulers, but orders placed are mostly for 2021. We expect Municipal volume to remain subdued for the balance of the year. Demand is reaccelerating for digital solutions in the space and overall we are constructive on the outlook for this business into 2021. We are seeing some encouraging signs and industrial automation and automotive OEM markets in particular in October. Aerospace and defense continues to be steady, most of what we plan to deliver in the next quarter is in the segments backlogs. We don't expect material upside and/or downside from our forecasts. We expect margin to be modestly impacted by volume and negative mix relative to Q3 largely due to demand seasonality. Fueling solutions remain constructive finishing the year and into 2021. As we've been guiding all year, we have a tough comp in Q4 due to record volumes in the comparable period. Despite the top line headwinds, we expect to hold year-over-year absolute adjusted operating profit as a result of our efforts done on product line harmonization productivity and pricing discipline. We expect 2021 to be a good year as demand trends remain constructive for our above ground and software solution businesses and we turn the corner on below ground fluid transfer and vehicle wash. Imaging and ID's remain steady. We saw robust activity in marking and coding exiting the third quarter and the backlog in the business is higher than last year. Activity and serialization software space is also picking up nicely. In digital print, demand for inks has picked up, which is a sign of improving printing volumes. We are seeing a pickup in quotations for new machines, but we expect a few more quarters before we returned to normal levels in this market. In Pumps & Process Solutions, we expect current trends to continue the biopharma plastics and processing continue [indiscernible] trajectory in pumps recovering to more normal levels, particularly in defense and select industrial applications. Compression product lines within the precision components exposed to mid-and-downstream are likely to see continued weaknesses in Q4 as projects and maintenance continue to be deferred. Overall, the pumps and process solutions outlook is supported by segment backlog that is aligned with what we had at this point last year. Let's get on to the last segment Refrigeration & Food Equipment. First, as said we are in the early innings what we believe to be a multi-year secular build-out of can making capacity, as evidenced by our backlog driven by the transition from plastic to aluminum containers and also the spike in demand for cans at home consumption of food and beverages. In food retail we deliver low teens margin for Q3 converting on our backlog providing us a baseline to reach our 2021 margin aspirations. Our backlog is beginning to build moving into 2021. As you all know, this is a seasonal business. So, Q4 volume and fixed cost absorption declines in Q4. And frankly it's all about 2021 from here and Q3 was a sign of good progress. We have a robust backlog and heat exchanges and are constructive in this market. Our capacity expansion projects are being completed and we have some interesting new products in the pipe. Finally, in commercial food service, large chain should continue to support activity, but will not fully offset weakness on the institutional side. Overall for the segment, comparable profits and margins for the segment are forecasted to be up in Q4 into the comparable period. With strong margin performance to date, we intend to deliver approximately flat year-over-year adjusted margin this year, despite a lower revenue base. As you may recall, we entered the year with a program entailing $50 million in structural cross reductions as part of our multi-year program highlighted at our 2019 Investor Day. We [action more] structural initiatives, which resulted in approximately $75 million of permanent cost reduction in 2020, leaving a $25 million annualized carryover benefit into 2021. We view this as a down payment on the 2021 portion of our multi-year margin improvement journey. And we'll update that with more to come on 2021 when we report the fourth quarter. We expect robust cash flow this year on the back of solid year to date cash flow generation and target free cash flow margin at the upper end of our guidance between 11% and 12%. Capital expenditures should tally up to approximately $159 for the year, with most of the larger outlays behind us. In summation, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.45 per share for the full year above the top end range of our prior guidance. We remain on the front foot in capital deployment posture with several bolt-ons closed last quarter. We have multiple opportunities in the hopper, and we hope to report on those soon. And as usual before wrapping up, I want to thank everybody at Dover for their work and continued perseverance in these uneasy times. And with that, Andrey, let's go to the Q&A. Hi Steve. Well, I would have hoped that when we did the Investor Day in the middle of the quarter that we were pretty forthright of what we thought the Q3 was going to be. And we would have hoped that estimates for Q3 would have moved up and that Q4 would have moved down and we've got neither. So here comes the Q3 is great, but Q4 is going to be a [myth, a narrative]. No, that was a general comment. That was not aimed at you at all. So look, you know, we have a bad comp and DFS, which we've been highlighting all year, just because of the fact that if you recall, we had a bunch of orders last year. We had some operational issues in the Q3. So, we shipped a ton in Q4, that's always been hanging out there. We over delivered to our this year's forecast in vehicle services group, which is a lot of the reason that we did a lot better in Q3.  So, if you think about automotive aftermarket, we had a couple really poor quarters. We had a lot of pent-up demand. I think operationally we hit the ball out of the park and delivered and over delivered what we'd expect our forecast to be. So that gives us sort of a negative comp going into Q4. Despite the backlog and refrigeration, I think I would caution you on the segment backlog while we're building backlog and refrigeration for [2021 deliveries] that backlog figure is materially impacted by the backlog that we have at Belvac, which is over $200 million worth of deliveries.  So, you know, and finally, you know, we're still getting COVID reports, particularly in Europe. So, I think there is an amount of prudence about, you know, are we going to have to take facilities down? Are certain regions of Europe going to be impacted from a demand cycle? So, I don't think it's bad news at all, quite frankly, in some of our higher CapEx businesses, like waste management, we're getting orders for 2021. Clearly, we could build that product and get the industrial absorption, but I've got absolute confidence in our management team, that let's manage our inventory in Q4, and we start up next year with high build rate. So overall, is there some conservatism in there? Sure, there is and that, until we get on the other side of this COVID issue, will continue to operate under that stance, but is there anything going on in terms of any particular market getting worse from the trajectory that it's on now? Absolutely not. The absolute profit comment was for the full-year of DFS. So, margin benefit outweighs top line decrease. And on Belvac, it is accretive to the segment margins. We are beginning to do a transition to a higher mix of turnkey projects. So, there's some pass through revenue. So, I think it'd be a little bit careful about the assumptions of Belvac, but we'll take it because, quite frankly, it's approved \u2013 it's accretive to the segment for sure. Thanks. Hi Scott. It's not a lot different than it was at the end of Q2. I mean there are some opportunities out there. Valuation continues to be reflective of the public markets. So, despite, you know, every, you know, even private companies are trying to see through the downturn of 2020 and want to be paid on 2021. So, it's pricey out there. A lot of competition in terms of private equity, but having said all that, on some of the more [niche opportunities] that we have, we're feeling good about some of those opportunities there. Some of which we highlighted during the Pumps & Process Solutions day that we did mid-month. So you know, we've got a pretty good list of candidates, but we're not going to overpay. And you know, and I think that some of these deals are taking longer because as you can imagine, due diligence under pandemic is a bit difficult. Look, I guess my overall comment is there's a bit of seasonality. And I'm just not going to do the project in Q4 because I can do it in Q1 of next year. The general commentary if I exclude kind of some of our businesses like textile digital print, which has some secular headwinds associated with it, which are particular, what we're hearing from our customers is a desire to spend in 2021 on productivity CapEx, which generally speaking is, makes up about 85% of our portfolio. So, going into 2021 as you can imagine, we're beginning to start to do the forecasting and the budget. You know, we feel good about a lot of our businesses. I think it \u2013 like if you take something like waste handling right now, the municipalities are going to sit on their hands now until they see what their budgets are for 2021, but on the private sector, we just think that we could build off our backlog now if we want, but I don't think there's any reason to do so, and we'll hold our powder dry, manage our working capital, and come out at the beginning of the year at high build rates. Thanks. Hey, Jeff. Yes, there \u2013 I think we got to be careful about promising margin accretion from here. I guess we just take it in absolute revenue growth. But look, my comments on the quarter was on the long-cycle side, which is particularly [MOG]. Timing those revenues is always difficult because of the size of the orders and you're dealing with letters of credits and a variety of things. But my opening commentary, as a general statement, I think that the operational performance of the Group in Q3 was excellent. I think that we're really beginning to get some traction and this is across the portfolio. In terms of what we've been working on, on operational efficiency and supply chain, and look, MOG built the product, it was ready to go and we were paid and out the door it goes. So \u2013 and that, generally speaking, is margin accretive, and you couple that with the fact that the trajectory on the biopharma side continues on and you get the margin performance that you see here. Sure. Let's deal with Belvac first, I'll flip the answer. Capacity has been extremely tight. It was tight in 2019, and then, COVID flipped it over in terms of the demand function. Think about beer, right? No one's consuming keg beer, it's all flipped into cans, so there's been a surge in terms of can demand. And if you go look at some of the bottlers, they've been [indiscernible] about canned pricing for some time, so here comes the capacity wave. These are big projects, so the planning period to get them up and going. We've known about them coming, I would say for a year now, but I think that COVID really drove the demand. So you've got the COVID issue in terms of the transition to kind of more at home, if you will. Overarching all that, you have this issue with PET and recyclability and a variety of other things. So that's why, you know, you've got a pull forward in terms of this massive capacity expansion being announced, which is driven by the shorter-term demand cycle. But I think that the can-makers would tell you that they believe it's secular because they think that they have an advantage from an environmental point of view. So, for us, we think that this is, you know, two to three years minimum, in terms of the secular trend for us, in particular on the machinery side. Back to refrigeration, look, we expected this year to be better. I know it's a low bar in terms of the demand function and we got negatively impacted by COVID because of access rights and everything else. We ran a capacity in Q3. As I mentioned my comments, we did low teens margin for the refrigeration piece of the business, which is a good harbinger in terms of what we're capable of doing, level loaded. Q4, it's all about there's a seasonality portion of this business. You generally don't do store refurbishments going into the Christmas season because I think it's going to be a stay-at-home Christmas, clearly. So, they're going to protect their infrastructure. But we are beginning to build a backlog for 2021 delivery now, so you'll see some under absorption in Q4, but as I mentioned in my comments, it's all about 2021 for us here. To your first question, we said that we were going \u2013 we were \u2013 it was a three-year program, a $50 million a year. We've pulled forward $20 million to $25 million into this year, so you get a calendarized carry over. But the fact of the matter is, we've got enough in the pipe that we're confident that we'll get the $50 million, and to the extent that we can work hard on it, we'll get kind of the roll forward of the calendarization carried forward in 2021. That's what I can say about in terms of absolute structural cost takeout.  On the temporary side, I think that we need to be careful because a lot of the temporary was based under furlough legislation that was available, okay. And that is going to be dependent on revenue and volume, so let's kind of put that aside for a moment. The rest of what we can call temporary or controllable is in the SG&A side. Look, at the end of the day, we would hope to build back comp, so that's a headwind, but I think that's important for morale around here. But on the other hand, clearly, on [T&E] and some of the other things, I do not expect us to come back to 2019 levels, no matter what the revenue profile is for 2021. So look, at the end of the day, Julian, it's going to be embedded in whatever guidance we give you for 2021, but we don't expect a full snapback to kind of 2019 comp SG&A levels. Yes, its \u2013 look, we have a wide range of margin profiles between the businesses and depending on what the starting point is, then the leverage is going to be different. So \u2013 and, you know, you heard the question before about pumps and process solution, I think it's fair to say that you're not going to get a lot of fixed cost absorption out of that particular segment, but any revenue that we get at current gross margins is going to be highly accretive. So, we look at it that way for that particular business, as opposed to digital textile printing, where you've had a very difficult time this year. We think that the operational leverage, when that comes back, is going to be in excess of gross margin level. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag depending on the current trajectory between 2020 and 2021. I'm glad you asked that question because as we mentioned, we did the Investor Day for Pumps & Process Solutions that we were going to do another one this year, we'll be announcing shortly another virtual Investor Day, which we will concentrate on the Fueling Solutions business and hopefully answer all your questions about 2021 trajectory and what we think the strengths of that business is. Thanks. Good morning, Andy. We're not all the way there yet. We're not getting the benefits of the automation in terms of the labor content, so we actually got to low-teens margin in the quarter without that. So, everything's pointing up. I think it is purely going to be a function of the demand profile of the business for 2021. What we can see right now or what we hear from our customer, I think it's going to be proactive for 2021. So meaning it looks like barring another wave of COVID, that revenue should rise for Refrigeration next year and we'll get the benefit of both the productivity and the operational leverage. So, you know, we're not \u2013 it's not all in the bag yet, but we're cautiously optimistic based on what we've seen in Q3 and I would not panic about Q4, just because of the negative leverage that we're always going to get in that segment. Like I said, it's all about 2021 from here. We worry about them all. But I think I mentioned a few. I think that we've been proactively prudent in ESG by cutting capacity early just because of this municipal issue, so we would expect to carry some negative leverage from 2020 into positive leverage in 2021. We feel really good about vehicle services group for 2021 [faced on] mostly \u2013 you know, the amount of miles driven, the amount of used cars that are out in the fleet and I think that management has got a lot of really great productivity initiatives in the pipe coming there. Let's see, I mean, I don't want to go through them all one by one. Refrigeration, we talked about. You know, we'll be cautious on digital printing, that's probably going to be a second half of 2021 in terms of the upturn. And look at if \u2013 and if Pumps & Process Solutions just can continue that trajectory that they're on, that is absolutely satisfactory. So, you know, we're not out of the woods. You know, we've got some business in terms that are highly leveraged towards CapEx. It's a little bit of a wait and see, but, you know, we're in the process of doing 2021 forecasts and we feel good about the demand function and we feel good about the rollover of our productivity initiatives going into next year. Sure. I mean, we are slightly behind in terms of the automation just because that we couldn't get contract or access for a period of time into our site, so that kind of gummed up the process a little bit. We're making good progress in terms of SKU management, but that is also a function of the demand cycle and somewhat a function of us getting the automation up because you need to kind of sell the benefits of the automation to your customer because those are the ones that you're convincing to change the SKUs at the end of the day. So look, I think that we're probably \u2013 you know, taking Q3 into account, we're halfway where we would expect it would have been under a more normal 2020 conditions. I guess that I can answer it that way. It would be \u2013 this is \u2013 you know, it's a bit of a reverse barbell, so it would be Q2 and Q3 of 2021 where we would expect to see the tangible benefits. John, I don't want to take away from all of the effort that the management team is undertaking right now to prepare for this Investor Day in November, which should answer all of the questions that you just asked. I think that the only thing that I will say that there was some talk about sizing the headwind for 2021. I would caution you that EMV is a North American phenomenon and our exposure in terms of the North American market is different than \u2013 so I think you have to size that appropriately and that our product mix between above-ground and below-ground is significantly different. You know, we've been carrying around a pretty weak below ground market this year, right? We had talked about the headwind on [doubled-wall] for China when we gave the guidance for this year, but then, you ran into COVID with access rights and construction and everything else. So, you know, at the end of the day, sure, margins are up. Some of that is driven by EMV demand for sure, but I don't want to take away from the productivity improvement that the management has done here that has driven margin accretion despite the topline. So, what our thoughts are in 2021, I'll leave it to November. When we get to it is that the EMV headwind is manageable to the extent that the below-ground business returns to growth in 2021. Thank you. Hi, Andrew. Let's see here, look, the only business that we have that if tangibly benefiting from COVID today would be biopharma, but that is a business \u2013 I think we sized it up for you. I mean, look, it's great. It's growing fantastically. The margins are terrific, but it's not overly materially weighted in the portfolio and that's the one that's benefiting. I mean, all this \u2013 you know, Belvac is going to benefit, but we believe that that is more structural than COVID-related just because of this issue of recyclability and moving away from PET. So, you know, we don't think that we have a COVID tailwind embedded anywhere on our business, so it's purely a question of the ones that are suffering, the portions of the portfolio are suffering, which ones are coming back. I think it's fair to say that the one that we're taking a close look like is that our compression business, which is the one that's levered most to midstream and downstream, whether that demand in terms of CapEx or maintenance remains subdued in 2021 or not. But again, that is not overly significant to the portfolio and we can weather the storm. So, you know, our expectation is that the parts of the portfolio that are doing reasonably well will continue to do so and the ones that have been under more pressure will come back on different trajectories based on their end markets. I wouldn't consider it to be weak. I mean, revenues were flat... ...and margin was up. I mean, yeah, the consumable business is tracking right with consumer goods, which is great. I mean, the printer business and the service business is still a bit choppy because that still requires access rights... ...and customer locations and everything else. Hi, Joe. Yes. Let me think about this. We are \u2013 look, we give segmental backlogs and I think that we size the portion of Belvac that's in there, which distorts that backlog because somewhat. You know, the Refrigeration business in particular is relatively short cycle. So, to the extent that we're getting orders for 2021 is actually early. Now, well, it would have been early, let's call it a month ago, which is a good sign because it's \u2013 generally speaking, food retailers don't kind of secure capacity. They just believe that that markets have been over capacities forever, so they just place the orders and you run through hoops to deliver it to them. So, I think the good news is based on what our customers are saying about their own CapEx and maintenance programs that we expect it to be up in 2021. And the other good data point is, is that we're getting orders for 2021 now, which is technically early, a little bit early, so that's the good news, but I wouldn't try to disaggregate our segmental backlog because you've got Belvac in there and it's very material. We're still prioritizing on the inorganic. We had to walk away from one in the quarter because of \u2013 for particular issues that would have been an outlay in excess of $300 million, so that has changed plans a little bit. Look, at the end of the day, it's a wait and see. We've got a decent pipeline. We'd like to convert that free cash into inorganic investment. But we're not just going to do deals to deploy the capital, right? They have to be smart and they have to be within the parameters that we've laid out. And if not, then we'll revisit capital return and I'm sure that will be a discussion. We have the board meeting next week. Hi, Josh. I think that we talked about Refrigeration at length and we've talked about Belvac that we've seen there. On our longer cycle businesses MOG, comes to mind DPC, to a certain extent. We would expect to deplete backlog in the second half of the year as, you know, bigger projects roll off and then you build it up. We shipped heavily off of that backlog in MOG and it's not as if we're falling into a hole. So, I think the good news about MOG is, is that despite heavy shipments in Q3, that backlog is not depleting at a high rate, which is \u2013 and that's all 2021 just because of the delivery times in those particular businesses. The balance of the portfolio outside of digital printing is, generally speaking, short cycle.  I mentioned vehicle service group who had an excellent quarter in terms of shipments and operational performance. They've got a little bit of a bad comp in Q4 just because they are running some promotional things last year prior to price increases, but what we're seeing in terms of dealer communication there is very good for 2021. So, I think it's anecdotal, so there's no real general comment for our portfolio this wide, but you know, I think that we're \u2013 the signaling we're getting for 2021 overall is perspective. As I mentioned before, I mean, you think about like a business like ESG, right? If they've got backlog for 2021 deliveries, we could make the product in Q4, which positive absorption, negative working capital. I've got confidence in that business to build that product in 2021 and meet the delivery date. So, to us, as we've always done around here, Q4 is about cash generation and setting ourselves up for 2021. There's a few of our businesses that lend themselves to increased automation. As we mentioned, during the Pumps and Process Solution Virtual Investor Day that our expectation is to get on a cadence of doing more of those rather than the tour de force on the portfolio. So, one of the things that we're discussing is we have two big projects, one of which is completed in vehicle services group and one that is under construction around that that we would expect is a candidate to do some more investor outreach in Q1 of 2021. You know, Nigel, I'm sure when I talk about Belvac, the guys at Belvac listen and chuckle to themselves how little I know about can making. So, for me to bridge that over into the chemical world on PET, I think you're going to have to ask somebody else. Based on what we hear from our customers, both the can makers on the machinery and from the bottlers in terms of the design portion of the can making, we believe that there's a structural change underway, how that impacts PET demand, I'll leave it up to the chemical producers to answer that. More on the heat pump side than anything else. That's where our particular strength is and that is where we are in the midst of completing some material capacity expansions. If you know anything about that market, the size of these heat exchangers is getting very large because these are pretty huge systems that are being installed specially on the back of European legislation. So that's really where the demand function for us is coming from. Thanks."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrey Galiuk: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available for playback through August 12 and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for 3 months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement, presentation materials, which are available on our website. We want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject uncertainties and risks, including the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity and cash flow. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the second quarter for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s begin with the summary of the results on Page 3. We expect that Q2 to be challenging and in preparation we reinforced our cost-out program earlier in Q1. So we were in some sense prepared for the battle. We entered the quarter with a comprehensive set of actions to manage through the turbulent times and focused on what we can control our operations, costs and importantly, safety of our employees. From an operational point of view, we are not out of the woods yet, but a significant majority of our facilities are up and running moving into Q3, which is positive to operating leverage as compared to this quarter. Top line trends are very much in line with our expectations entering the quarter. Revenue declined 16% organically and bookings declined 21%. Trends have improved in the quarter and we saw material sequential improvement in June. We still carry a strong backlog across all segments and that increases our confidence for the second half. Margin performance for the quarter was acceptable considering the state of business activity in April and May. After profitability gains in Q1 on lower revenue, we targeted 25% to 30% decremental margin for the full year. Thanks to the broad-based cost control efforts to offset under-absorption of fixed costs and steady execution of $50 million of in-flight initiatives, we achieved 27% decremental margin in Q2, a quarter which we expect to be the trial for the year. That puts us on track to exceed our initial full year target. In addition to the tight cost controls and variable costs, we took further structural cost actions in the quarter as part of our business realignment activities, which will benefit us in the second half. Along with our cost actions, our proactive working capital management resulted in cash flow improvement in both absolute and conversion terms. We generated $78 million more in free cash flow than the comparable quarter last year. As a result of our first half performance and our solid order backlog, we are reinstating our annual adjusted EPS guidance to $5 to $5.25 per share. To be clear, even with a strong backlog and positive recent trends, we still see demand uncertainty in our markets and are not back to business as usual, but our teams have proven their ability to manage costs and operations and we are prepared to operate and achieve results in a wide variety of scenarios that maybe in store for the second half. Let\u2019s take a look at the segment performance on Slide 4. Engineered Products had a tough quarter, particularly in shorter cycle and CapEx-levered businesses like vehicle aftermarket, industrial automation and industrial winches. Waste hauling and aerospace and defense were more resilient shipping against their strong backlogs. Lower volumes led to margin decline versus a very strong margin that this segment posted in the comparable quarter last year and we have taken structural cost actions in this segment, which will support its margin in the second half along with recovering volumes. Fueling Solutions saw continued strong activity in North America driven by demand of EMV compliance solutions, whereas Europe and Asia declined due to COVID-related production and supply chain interruptions as well as budget cuts and deferrals in response to the decline in oil prices. Increased margin performance was commendable with 80 basis point increase on a better mix pricing and ongoing productivity actions. The sales decline in Imaging and Identification was driven predominantly a steep decline in our digital textile printing business, which we expected in the significant dislocation in global apparel and fashion markets due to the pandemic. Marking and coding showed continued resilience on strong demand for consumables and fast-moving consumer goods solutions. This is our highest gross margin segment. So decremental margins are challenging and require heavy lifting on cost containment. Our marking and coding business did a good job achieving a flat margin year-over-year and we have taken proactive actions to manage the cost base in the digital printing business. As a result of these actions and a pickup in textiles consumable volumes, we expect performance to improve in the second half.0 Pumps & Process Solutions demonstrated the resilience we expected. Its top line declined the least among our segments despite a challenging comparable from last year. Strong growth continued in biopharma and medical applications with colder products posting record growth in the quarter. This was offset by a moderate decline in industrial applications and material slowing and energy markets. Our Plastics Processing business revenue declined in the quarter as a result of shipment timing, we expect for it to do well in the second half off a strong backlog. As you can see, this segment continued to deliver a solid margin performance posting improving margin on declining revenue for the second quarter in a row. We expect this segment to deliver flat or improved absolute profit for the full year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined as food retailers continued to delay construction remodels due to peak utilization and the commercial food service market remains severely impacted by restaurant and school closures in the United States. Our heat exchanger business showed resilience, particularly in non-HVAC applications. On the margin side, negative absorption on lower volumes drove the margin decline. In Q2, we took structural cost actions in this segment, which paired with ongoing productivity and automation initiatives yield in a materially improved margin performance in the month of June. We expect these benefits to continue accruing in the second half and expect the segment to deliver year-over-year growth in absolute earnings and margin in the second half of this year. I will pass it to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s go to Slide 5. On the top is the revenue bridge. As Rich mentioned in his opening remarks, the top line was adversely impacted by COVID-19, with each segment posting year-over-year organic revenue declines. FX continued to be a meaningful headwind in Q2, reducing top line by 1% or $24 million. We expect FX to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year. Acquisitions were effectively offset by dispositions in the quarter. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects relatively more resilient trends in North America and Asia versus the more significant impacts across Europe and several emerging economies like India, Brazil and Mexico. The U.S., our largest market declined 10% organically with four segments posting organic declines partially offset by growth in retail fueling. All of Asia declined 14%. China, representing approximately half of our business in Asia, showed early signs of stabilization posting an 11% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, an improvement compared to a 36% decline in Q1. Imaging & Identification and Engineered Products were up in China, while Fueling Solutions declined due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate and also slower demand from the local national oil companies. Europe was down 19% on organic declines in all five segments. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were down 21% organically on declines across all five segments, but there are reasons for cautious optimism as we enter the second half. First, as presented in the box on the bottom, June bookings saw a significant improvement from the May trough, with all five segments posting double-digit month-over-month sequential growth. Second, our backlog is up 8% compared to this time last year driven by our longer cycle businesses and the previously mentioned intra-quarter improvement in our shorter cycle businesses. We believe we are well-positioned for the second half of the year. Let\u2019s move to the bridges on Slide 6. I will refrain from going into too much detail on the chart, but the adverse top line trend drove EBIT declines, although our cost containment and productivity initiatives help offset overall margins to hold up at an acceptable decremental. In the quarter, we delivered on the $50 million annual cost reduction program, which focuses on IT footprint and back office efficiency and took additional restructuring charges that add to the expected benefits. We also executed well in the quarter on additional cost takeout to offset the under-absorbed \u2013 under-absorption of fixed cost previously estimated at $35 million to $40 million. Some of these recent initiatives will continue supporting margins in the second half and into 2021. Going to the bottom chart, adjusted earnings declined mainly due to lower segment earnings partially offset by lower interest expense and lower taxes on lower earnings. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, is approximately 21.5% for the quarter unchanged from the first quarter. Discrete tax benefits in the quarter were approximately $2 million slightly lower than the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Rightsizing and other costs were $17 million in the quarter or $13 million after-tax relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into 2020. Now, moving to Slide 7, we are pleased with the cash generation in the first half of the year, with year-to-date free cash flow of $269 million, a $126 million or 90% increase over last year. Our teams have done a good job managing capital more effectively in this uncertain environment. We have seen strong collections on accounts receivables and continue to operate with inventories of supportive of our backlog in order trends. Q2 also benefited from an approximately $40 million deferral of U.S. tax payments into the second half of the year. Capital expenditures were $79 million for the first 6 months of the year, a $12 million decline versus the comparable period last year. Most of our in-flight growth and productivity capital projects were completed in the second quarter. So we expect to see continued year-over-year capital expenditure declines in the second half. Lastly, now on Slide 8. Dover\u2019s financial position remains strong. We have been targeting a prudent capital structure and our leverage of 2.2x EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment grade rating, with a margin of safety. Second, we are operating with approximately $1.6 billion of current liquidity, which consists of $650 million of cash and $1 billion of unused revolver capacity. When commercial paper markets were fractured at the outset of the pandemic in March, we drew $500 million on our revolver out of an abundance of caution. Markets have since stabilized and we reestablished our commercial paper program and fully repaid the revolver. In Q2, we also secured a new incremental $450 million revolver facility to further bolster our liquidity position. As of June, we have no drawn funds on either revolver. Our prudent capital structure, access to liquidity and strong cash flow have allowed us to largely maintain our capital allocation posture. We have deployed nearly a $0.25 billion on accretive acquisitions so far this year and we continue to pursue attractive acquisitions. Finally, we are lifting our recent suspension on share repurchase and we will opportunistically buyback stock should the market conditions dictate. I will turn it back over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Thanks Brad. I am on Page 9, which is an updated view of the demand outlook by business we introduced last quarter. Here we are trying to provide you with directional estimates of how we expect segments to perform in the second half relative to the second quarter in lieu of full year revenue guidance. I will caveat that all of this is based on current reads of the markets and is subject to change as the situation remains fluid. First in Engineered Products, shorter cycle businesses such as vehicle service and industrial automation have shown improvement late in the quarter and the trends are improving globally. Additionally, aerospace and defense continues operating from a large backlog of defense program orders. Waste handling may see some headwinds driven by tightening of industry CapEx and municipal finances after several years of strong growth performance. Bookings have slowed in late in Q2 as customers paused their capital spending to manage liquidity. We were watching the dynamics closely, but we have started addressing the cost base in this business proactively. Fueling Solutions is a tale of two cities, North America, approximately half the business remained resilient both on EMV conversion and also willingness of non-integrated retailers to continue investing in their asset base. In Europe and Asia, integrated oil companies represent a larger share of the network and capital budget cuts resulting from oil price declines are having a more negative impact on investment in the retail network, plus recall we are facing a $50 million revenue headwind in China this year from the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate. Despite some of the top line headwinds with robust margin accretion to-date, we expect segment to hold its comparable full year profit line despite a decreasing top line. Imaging & Identification outlook is improving. Our service and maintenance interventions resumed in marking and coding as travel restrictions were lifted and we are seeing a resulting pickup demand for printers. Our integration activities with Systech acquisition are proceeding as planned. We started seeing some green shoots on the digital textile printing side, but we are forecasting a difficult year as global textiles will take time to recover. And Pumps & Process Solutions is expected to show improved trajectory from here. First, our plastics and polymer businesses will ship against its significant backlog in the second half. Biopharma and medical is expected to continue its impressive growth. Industrial pumps, a shorter cycle business, is expected to start gradually recovering. A material portion of demand in our pumps and precision components business is levered to maintenance and repair and aftermarket. The oil and gas mid and downstream markets served primarily by our precision components business continues to be slow as a result of deferral of CapEx and refurbishment spending in refining and pipelined operators. In Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we believe the worst is behind us for this segment. Bookings were relatively resilient for this segment and we have improved in June resulting in a robust backlog that we are prepared to execute against. We also saw growth is restarting the construction and remodel projects resulting in us being fully booked for refrigeration cases into Q4. Additionally, Belvac is scheduled to begin shipments against its significant backlog, which will be accretive to segment margins. Recovery in volumes along with cost actions we have undertaken should result in positive margin and profit trend through the remainder of the year resulting in the segment posting a second half comparable profit increase. Let\u2019s go to Slide 10. As a result of the fluidity of the COVID situation, we are cautious about guiding top line trajectory at this time, but everything points to sequential improvement from here across most markets. The proactive cost management stance we took in Q1 and continued in Q2 has positioned us from a margin performance standpoint. And today, we are improving our target for annual decremental margin to 20% to 25% as we continue work in the pipeline of restructuring actions, including those targeting benefits in 2021 and we are positioned well to deliver on our margin objectives. We remain confident in the cash flow capacity of this portfolio and are reiterating a conversion target above 100% of adjusted net earnings and a cash flow margin target of 10% to 12% compared to 8% to 12% target we had last year. The rest of the slide, Brad covered earlier in the presentation. I will conclude with the following. We have reinitiated EPS guidance as a result of our confidence in our ability to manage costs in an uncertain demand environment. We have a good team and they understand the playbook. Having said that, make no mistake, we are on the front foot from here on driving revenue growth both organically and inorganically. We have strong operating companies and a strong balance sheet with which to support them. This is not the time to hunker down and wait for the storm to pass, so we are equally focused on market share gains, new product development initiatives as we are on our main pillars of synergy extraction from our portfolio, all of which we continue to fund despite the market challenges. Inorganically, we have available capital to deploy and I fully expect to be active in the second half. In summation, I\u2019d like to thank everyone at Dover again for their continued perseverance in these difficult times. And with that let\u2019s go to Q&A. Andrey?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys. Rich nice quarter.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: You mentioned material sequential improvement in June. Are there any of your shorter cycle businesses that have not improved as fast or faster than expected? And can you give us more color on, if you have seen any sort of slowdown in the rate of improvement in late June and July, particularly in the U.S.?\nRichard Tobin: We would have not given out full year EPS guidance without seeing June. That is how I think that we have mentioned that when we ended Q1 that June was very important in terms of what we thought the trajectory was. And so, I mean, I think that we went through the bookings change of June and made a variety of different comments about the business about the moving parts of who is improving and who is not. I mean, I don\u2019t want to go through all the companies again. We have got a few, like digital printing, like food service that have not improved and we don\u2019t expect them to improve. So at the end of the day that\u2019s not built into our guidance. But we called out a few of the shorter cycle businesses like aftermarket automotive for example, which has picked up significantly at the end of the quarter. So June was good. I think that we are pleased. It was material to the quarter earnings June. The profit the absolute profit in June was double what we made in April, just to put it in contextually. So I think if you go back and you look based on the I think whatever slide it is in here, the Slide 9, that gives you the color all the color I can give you in terms of the trajectory of the portfolio and the moving parts.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Great. And then your commentary on Refrigeration & Food equipment was relatively optimistic. May be talking about the second half of the year, but as you said backlogs continue to improve. Have your customers given you more of an indication that they are right to let you into their stores yet. And then we know your automation project was a start-up in July. So maybe just update us on that? And can give us a little more color on sort of the margin trajectory in the second half of the year?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. Let\u2019s start with Refrigeration. We are booked into Q4. So it\u2019s up to us now to produce the product without have any frictional costs and based on the margin that the business delivered in June, if we can get that for the full quarter, I think, which is our expectation, I think we will be pleased. In addition to that, part of the large backlog that we have in this segment is geared toward Belvac. So we are on the front foot in terms of capacity expansion in aluminum can making and we are participating in that and we have got some relatively large projects that will begin building at higher rates in the second half. And in all honestly, I mean, if we put foodservice equipment aside for a moment, we don\u2019t have the hardest comp in the second half. It\u2019s not as if we exited 2019 firing on all cylinders. So we will \u2013 that\u2019s why we will do better H2-to-H2 on a comparable basis, but it\u2019s largely as a result of heat exchangers continuing to improve modestly over the second half, Belvac shipments and material improvement in Refrigeration cases.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And then the automation project itself?\nRichard Tobin: That\u2019s baked into the margin improvement that we expect in the second half.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Okay. Thanks Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hey, Scott.\nBrad Cerepak: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: Rich or Brad, can you give us just a sense of this shape or recovery in China. It\u2019s \u2013 this quarter, I think you said it was down 11%. Does 3Q then become, I mean, if you had to guess, is it more flattish or is it still down and with the chance of being up in 4Q?\nRichard Tobin: Look, all of the relative decline or substantially all of the relative decline in the quarter is because of this double wall tank issue, which we had guided at the beginning of the year. I think that if we remove that, we were \u2013 I believe we were flat to slightly up on the balance of the businesses. So that\u2019s going to be a headwind for us in the second half. Scott, I have not done the calculations of what that means quarter-by-quarter, but we always had that $50 million headwinds that we were going to have to deal with. It\u2019s a bit slow on top of that in Fueling Solutions, just because the national oil companies in China are not spending any money right now. But if I \u2013 if we eliminate Fueling Solutions, the balance of our business which is mostly Printing & ID, have improved materially in Q2 and you expect that to continue for the balance of the year, and that\u2019s volume related, right. So as China has restarted and business activity started, you can think about marking and coding into the consumption of consumables and things like that.\nScott Davis: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on CapEx, I mean you are running at lower than usual levels I guess \u2013 lower than the expected levels. Do you anticipate that having to go up meaningfully kind of 2021 or do you think, I mean, you can imagine need a lot of capacity, but two facilities that need to be invested in etcetera is there \u2013 or is there going to potentially continue through 2021?\nRichard Tobin: Over, I would say the last where are we now in July, over the last 8 to 10 months, we have had approximately $80 million of spending that were attributed to two projects. One was the automation project for Refrigeration cases and one was the brand new building that we built for Colder Products up in Minnesota. So those \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline of that quantum. So I would expect CapEx to slightly rise in 2021, but not materially as if we deferred CapEx in 2020, and we have got catch-up in 2021. Now having said that, what, if we have got the demand, and we get some projects in that we don\u2019t have in the pipe, we are more than happy to invest organically in this business based on the returns we get.\nScott Davis: Got it. Thanks. Good luck, guys. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Rich and Brad the $13.4 million of cost actions you took in the quarter, how much of that was \u2013 how much of that maps against the original $50 million target and how much was new incremental structural, because I think Rich, you had called out some new incremental structural in a couple of the business segments in your prepared remarks.\nRichard Tobin: That is the new structural. So the $50 million...\nJohn Inch: So that\u2019s all new structural.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. The $50 million was done and dusted and it was on average $13 million a quarter. That\u2019s what we got in this quarter and that\u2019s what we can expect rolling through the other two. The charge that we took for restructuring in Q2 was new. It was a project that we are working on. We just pulled it forward. So it will have an impact in the second half of the year, but that is baked into our EPS guidance.\nJohn Inch: So the $50 million or the $13 million that\u2019s kind of baked in the cake and based on your intentions Rich, when we exit 2020, how much more annualized structural do you think you will have gotten out annualized, so not necessarily all in 2020, by the time we exit 2020?\nRichard Tobin: How about...\nJohn Inch: Incrementally just due to...\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I know where you are going. But let\u2019s \u2013 give us another quarter, because we have got some other actions in the pipeline. And when we get to the end of Q3, we can kind of give you some color of where we are tracking on the $50 million for 2021, but it\u2019s a bit premature right now.\nJohn Inch: Okay. So just to be clear, this is stuff that you are doing that is targeted at sort of baking in the cake the 2021 $50 million or is this \u2013 do we have like a $50 million annually. And then we have this downturn and you go, we can do even more on top of that, or this is all part of that progression of the $50 million?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I think this is what we said at the end of Q1. While we are not just going to sit here and wait for the clouds to part, right? We are being on \u2013 we are taking some action on the front foot. These are projects that we had in the pipeline, and because the level of business activity that we had, we just said, why don\u2019t we do it now. So that action was taken. So they are incremental to the 2020 $50 million. They will accrue some benefit in the second half of 2020, and then we will redo all of what we think that we have got in the pipe for 2021 likely at the end of Q3.\nJohn Inch: And then, just as a follow-up, what sort of temporary cost actions, is there a way Brad to quantify those like you could call it furloughs or T&E? And I\u2019m curious then Rich, given the environment, right, like a lot of companies are now realizing, people can work from home. We don\u2019t need as much travel. What is your thought process toward turning some of those temporary cost saves, if you could give us the magnitude and just say more permanent cost saves depending on how the economy unfolds?\nRichard Tobin: Well, look at the end of the day, the temporary cost savings as a result of managing bonus accruals, we would expect and hopefully to build those back next year. So those come back. On the variable cost, mostly in SG&A, I think the jury is still out. I think that clearly we like everybody else have recognized that. What we need to conduct business may be different in 2021 when we looked back historically. So we get ready to do our plans on the operating company level for 2021, the conversations we are having are operating company president is, this is a notion of okay, well, I can go put my \u201819 SG&A back as long as the revenue supports it, but I think it\u2019s a bit premature to kind of monetize that now. But clearly, we are thinking about it and I don\u2019t expect that we will just snap back from an SG&A point of view, back to \u201819 levels.\nJohn Inch: That makes sense. And is there a way to quantify what sort of cost actions temporarily you took because of COVID in the quarter or sort of the run rate or whatever?\nRichard Tobin: Look at the end of the day, we had a $35 million to $40 million fixed cost absorption headwind that we offset with temporary cost \u2013 with cost actions, right? That allowed us to have more or less flat gross margins quarter-to-quarter. Then we offset 30% of the lost revenue with SG&A cuts. Look at it that way.\nJohn Inch: Very helpful. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nRichard Tobin: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just using kind of the \u2013 maybe this is like to sneak here something, but using the percentage of sales for free cash flow getting to something in kind of $6.4 billion range for annual sales. Is that kind of around the right level?\nRichard Tobin: We are going to get to a revenue number by hook or crook here. This is the interesting way to go about it. Look, I think that that we have got line of sight on the percentage of revenue and on the conversion of net income. I expect \u2013 we have exited Q2 with arguably inventory that supports the short, what we can see it for Q3. So I would expect barring a real snap back in demand, outside of what we have got baked into our numbers that will be liquidating inventory between now and the end of the year.\nSteve Tusa: Right. I guess on the revenue, though, like...\nRichard Tobin: I know where you\u2019re going. Look, I don\u2019t think the number that you put out there is outlandish.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And when we think about kind of the third and the fourth quarter splits, I mean, in \u201818 \u2013 they usually are kind of around each other. I would think this year, maybe with the cost, the structural cost coming in and a bit of that Belvac backlog, perhaps in the fourth quarter. It sounds like things kind of took a step up in June. So maybe you are trending third quarter better. I mean how do we think about kind of the linearity for the third and the fourth quarter normally. Kind of seasonally, it looks like it\u2019s roughly equal, but maybe this year it\u2019s a little lower in third and higher in fourth. How do we think about the linearity there on the EPS?\nRichard Tobin: You have got your finger on it. I mean, I think that we clearly we have a tough comp in Q4 in DFS. So that will be levered to Q3. The swing factor is going to be where we are on the long cycle side, which is driven by Belvac and Maag, and then to a certain extent, some other companies in there. I hope that we are bringing a lot of that into Q3. And if that\u2019s the case then you would have a sequentially better Q3 and we are talking comp-to-comp here.\nSteve Tusa: Yes.\nRichard Tobin: Than Q4. So what\u2019s known is barring a \u2013 and look I hope it happens, but barring a real uptick in demand on EMV in Q4. Right now, our expectation would be that we are down in DFS Q-to-Q. But I think right now based on June we are probably trending a little bit on a comp basis better Q3 and not \u2013 and less so in Q4 right now.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And then just lastly, just to be clear on this CapEx thing. You guys actually I think raised the CapEx number from where you were last quarter. So it doesn\u2019t look to me like there is, that\u2019s the kind of the free cash flow comp for next year. It\u2019s not like you are kind of squeezing tight there and that you have got a tougher comp on cash next year that this year\u2019s cash obviously is inflated a bit by better working capital, but that we should think about some free cash flow growth next year, despite kind of the unusual situation of this year where things are being squeezed a bit.\nRichard Tobin: That\u2019s fair.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hey, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey. So, Rich, you guys did provide like a lot of great color on Slide 9 on what your expectation is kind of for the rest of the year. But I guess, from a magnitude standpoint, can you help provide maybe just a little bit more color on how June actually trended from a magnitude perspective and whether that\u2019s just persisted into July?\nRichard Tobin: Well, look, I mean, as I mentioned earlier, June was materially better than April, but April I hope that we don\u2019t see again anytime soon. I mean April and May in certain of our businesses, which is a function, a lot of this issue about the declining backlog, I mean we were not shipping anything and we were not getting any orders either. So when we were looking at this decision about reinstituting guidance for the full year, I think that we have got a good playbook in control in terms of the operating cost side, but it was almost entirely contingent upon how June was, how June manifested itself, and June came in both on a bounce back in the order rates and in terms of absolute profit that portends well for Q3. So Brad\u2019s got the joke, if we can just keep having June\u2019s from here on out, we would probably be in good shape for the balance of the year. So that is about the color I can give you on it.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Fair enough. And I guess just as a follow-up to that, I thought you guys lifted your buyback suspension. I guess, how are you thinking about deploying capital at this point and whether you are going to be more aggressive now that you have lifted the suspension?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, I think the hierarchy remains the same of organic investment, inorganic investment and then capital return. I think that the CapEx number that we have given you for the full year is relatively safe now. So it is going to depend on inorganic investment. And if you go back to the comments, I think that the pipeline that we have right now is relatively encouraging and I expect to be deploying inorganic capital in the second half. But having said that, if we are unable to get the returns inorganically that we seek then, we will address capital return and not sit on a cash balance here.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. I will get back in queue. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hey, just one more here on the June two step, if I may. I am sure June is typically better than May, any quarter right. Good quarter, bad quarter, I mean can you just give us some kind of historical context of how significant the sequential lift was versus what would be normal?\nRichard Tobin: You know what, I don\u2019t know the answer to that question, because we were \u2013 everything that we look at around here is a function of relative declines. So, which is a \u2013 this tells you a lot about 2020 in the COVID era. But I mean, I think that the rate of revenue decline in June was significantly less than we saw in April and May, but \u2013 if I \u2013 of the top my head, Jeff, I guess the guys are furiously going through pages here, relative to seasonality I don\u2019t know. I think that Andrey is going to have to follow-up with you on that one.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. I am on his calendar I will do that with him. We had some discussion here I think on earlier questions about temporary actions. I think it\u2019s pretty clear how you are going to kind of to manage those as they possibly come back. In that context, Rich, as we think about the other side of this valley and managing for growth on the other side, what are you thinking on incrementals? Is there significant headwind from stuff coming back or can you kind of manage this kind of I would guess maybe 30% zip code incrementals on the way back out there?\nRichard Tobin: Other than bonus accruals, there is really no overhang of deferral of costs that have to snap back. I think the big question, I think there was a question earlier about it and I think this supplies, not just to Dover to everybody is, everybody has reduced travel cost right. Does it come back to \u201819 levels as a percent of revenue or not, I mean, the expectation there is absolutely not. I think that we have proven that we can run this business with less discretionary spending, than we may have thought is necessary exiting \u201819. So, what the quantum of that is, is I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell, but we will be reflected in whenever we give our guidance for \u201821 for sure. The rest of it \u2013 you look at the end of the day, I think that we did a admirable job in managing furloughs and a variety of things. So I don\u2019t expect that we are going to run significant industrial friction with over time or anything else in the second half. That\u2019s my expectation. It won\u2019t be perfect, but I don\u2019t see that our incremental margins should have any kind of negative drag once we get to \u2013 hopefully soon, back to growth.\nJeff Sprague: And just one last one if I could. So, on the M&A front, it sounds like you clearly have stuff in your sites now, which is the question of whether you can get it across the finish line. Should we be thinking kind of the similar size of what these \u2013 some of these recent bolt-ons have been or is there some bigger stuff in the pipeline? And I will leave it there. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin: Sure. Actionable it\u2019s going to be similar size to what you have seen. There is some bigger opportunities that are out there, the bigger the opportunity, the more competition. So returns get tighter. So we will see on that front. But I am pretty confident on kind of the size that we have seen year-to-date. It\u2019s just a question of, can we close them in the second half.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just the first question around the Imaging and ID segment, fairly, heavy decrementals in the first half given the gross margins and what happened with sales. I didn\u2019t see too much color on the margin outlook on Slide 4 for that segment. So maybe help us understand, how you see decrementals in the second half and how much narrower those should be in that segment versus what we saw in Q1 or Q2?\nRichard Tobin: They should \u2013 well, I mean, let\u2019s start from the beginning here. In marking and coding, our margin which is substantially the bigger portion of that segment, our margins were flat. So, all of the decremental margin in that segment was from textile printing. And if we go back and take a look at sequentially last year, textile printing weakened in the second half. So, decrementals as long as marking and coding can hold their margin performance which we fully expect them to do should be less in the second half, just because of an easier comp.\nJulian Mitchell: I understand. Thank you. And then switching maybe to the DEP segment, there had been a very strong multi-year period for the sort of waste handling piece. It\u2019s somewhat of a niche market. So I just wondered if you could give us any context around what you are thinking for the medium term there, given what\u2019s happened to or what will happen to municipal budgets and what kind of upgrade cycle, you have already had there in recent years. Just trying to gauge, how optimistic you are in that business beyond just the next quarter or so?\nRichard Tobin: I think that the business management of that particular business has been on the front foot. The non-municipal business, if you go look at some of bigger publicly traded operators, they have cut CapEx because of the profitability headwinds that they have had on their non-residential business. We would consider that likely, just to be deferred into 2021 as they manage their own cost structure. On the municipal side, we don\u2019t see a lot of negative headwinds today, but considering the financing of cities and towns because of this COVID crisis, I think it\u2019s a better than even bet that there is some headwinds coming there and because of that I think the management is taking action on its cost structure to accommodate that today rather than waiting for the last minute.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. And on the cost-out point, Rich, that you just made, why that Dover I think you had $20 million of restructuring charges in the first half in aggregate. Sorry if I missed it, but what\u2019s the placeholder for the second half for that number?\nRichard Tobin: We don\u2019t \u2013 look, we are working on a variety of actions. I think we have got several footprint related actions in the pipeline, whether we will be able to action them in the second half or not, I am not entirely sure, but it\u2019s probably then a better than even bet that we will take some footprint related charges in the second half. But I will give you the quantum when we get it all done.\nJulian Mitchell: Understood. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Julian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning guys. I am kind of curious on, obviously you have elected not to give any revenue boundaries, which I completely understand. But I would be curious how you see the rank ordering by segments in the second half of the year in terms of relative strength rather than weakness. I think in the past, Rich, you have called out Pumps & Process has been the leader, which doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. But do you still see the similar ranking to how you viewed the world back in the first quarter?\nRichard Tobin: Look, I don\u2019t think in terms of what we expect to relative to Q2 those nice arrows that Andrey put on the Slide on Page 9 is kind of where we things \u2013 where we think the moving parts are relative to Q2. And then you have got moving parts, because quite frankly, you have had some businesses that are operated through the crisis relatively well. So, we knew the Pumps & Process Solutions, because of it\u2019s exposure on the biopharma side, was in a good position to kind of weather the storm as we got to the end of Q1 and it\u2019s proven that so far. We expected to act \u2013 to hold profits flat for the full year is our expectation despite the headwind on the industrial pumps side. The marking and coding, quite frankly, has had an excellent performance holding margins year-to-date. Look the textile printing business, it\u2019s just what it is, when you have your end market just absolutely blown up, we are just going to have to wait this out and that really will be hopefully a \u201821 story rather than a \u201820 story. So I don\u2019t think that we think anything different today than we did at the end of Q1 in terms of the relative resilience of the individual pieces in the portfolio.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Very clear. Thanks. And then, cash is building quite nicely about $650 million at the end of the quarter. You normally run somewhere between $300 million to $400 million depending on the quarter. But if you don\u2019t deploy capital, it seems unlikely you are going to be close to $1 billion by year-end. So my question is, I am not asking you to give us a number in terms of buyback etcetera, but I would be curious how you view cash \u2013 the cash buffer going into \u201821. Where do you feel comfortable, is it back to $300 million to $400 million? So, is it going to run higher going from here?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Look, I mean, I think you need to correct for dividend payments into the future, number one. And then after that, look, I think that we are not going to sit on a bunch of cash with negative yield on it for sure. But the buffer will flex up and down based on the probability of inorganic investment at the end of the day, right. That\u2019s going to be there. So if we are returning cash in Q4, it\u2019s because the pipeline that we see right now we don\u2019t have any short-term requirement to sit on the cash. If we happen to sit on at the end of the year, I think that you can almost can through that as a positive signal, because it means we may be building cash because probability weighting of the pipeline looks good.\nNigel Coe: Right. And then quickly on inventories, the bulk of the inventory build was raw materials or the majority of it was. Is that a conscious decision to buffer the supply chain? Or this is just one of the things?\nRichard Tobin: It\u2019s purely on the backlog that we have going into Q3.\nNigel Coe: Got it. Okay.\nRichard Tobin: So I would expect barring a snap back in revenue expectations for Q4 that we should come down in inventory, in finished goods inventory and industrial inventory in Q3, some.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, yes. Hi, how are you? Can you hear me?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I can here you.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. So question on supply chains, can you just talk about how much in terms of inefficiency in terms of supply chains have you seen in the second quarter. Anyway to quantify it and how do you see supply chains evolving into the second half?\nRichard Tobin: It was not a material headwind in Q2. Now, having said that, we were not making a lot in Q2, so the areas that we did have constraints, it wasn\u2019t like we were under the gun in terms of production performance. But for the most part our supply chains are relatively short considering the individual size of our businesses. So, we had a few headwinds here and there, but it was not material from a cost point of view in Q2.\nAndrew Obin: Got it. So for the second half and going forward, no real changes in how you do business?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Well I guess it\u2019s going to depend on the trajectory of all of the businesses, because, look at the end of the day, we have done relatively well on input costs. So, as demand went down, we will be able to extract some benefits in raw material prices and the like remains to be seen. I think we are probably bought forward through Q3 and probably a little bit into Q4, but we have got to watch the dynamics. If business activity snaps back, then we can expect oil prices to go up, so transportation cost to go up and the like. So we will keep an eye and right now, but right now on an input cost basis, we have been a beneficiary, I think in terms of input cost year-to-date.\nAndrew Obin: Got it. Just a follow-up question, in terms of Europe, I think there was some talk back in May about Europeans trying to catch up post COVID. I think there was talk about VW being staying open in August or some talks about Italian staying open in August. Can you just give an update, anything different about how European businesses that you interact with will treat summer shutdown this year after COVID?\nRichard Tobin: Andrew, that\u2019s a good question. I will have to get Andrey to get back to you. I think on consumer goods we have seen decent performance which manifests itself in the marking and coding business. I think in heat exchangers, we exited on a positive trajectory from where we were at the beginning of the quarter. So, that\u2019s kind of industrial applications, for lack of a better word. But I would have to get back to you on the \u2013 and look and then we had certain businesses in the portfolio like automotive aftermarket that in April and May were absolutely very low levels of activity. So, June relative to those two months as improved, but I don\u2019t think we need to get overly excited because that base is relatively low.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks a lot. I will follow-up with Andrey.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning guys.\nBrad Cerepak: Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So we played a good amount of kind of outlook thing go here and filled in both of the squares. I guess I will just I will try one more edge if you don\u2019t mind? How much of the improvement in June, if you had to summarize was customers reopening versus kind of improving, I mean just turning the lights on again versus really kind of ramping back up into any activity levels?\nRichard Tobin: Alright. You have got me. \nJosh Pokrzywinski: I admit, it\u2019s a little in here.\nRichard Tobin: We had a lot of the businesses that we are absolutely shut in April and May from end market point of view. So you have a reopening aspect to it, and that\u2019s why we were \u2013 when we were talking about the results of the end of Q1, we were basically saying look a lot of this hinges on whether we are right about June or not in terms of the trajectory and we ended up I guess, calling it right, for lack of better word, but our portfolio Josh, is so diverse, if any answer to that question is just not going to be applicable across the entire portfolio. So \u2013 which, quite frankly is a strength to a certain extent.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: And then second question, I know obviously shippable second half backlog is something you guys talked a lot about today. What does that mean or how do you guys think about the plan for backlog at the end of the year? Is the plan basically saying what we are going to be depleted and orders need to pick to put us in kind of a normal position, exiting the year or is the level of kind of backlog depletion that you are contemplating kind of normal for lack of a better term.\nRichard Tobin: I think, normal for lack of a better in the longer cycle business where it tends to be lumpy. The Maags of the world and the Belvacs of the world, they are actually building a back \u2013 a long cycle backlog into 2021 today. On the short cycle side, that is going to be more short cycle. So it depends on the trajectory between now and the end of the year, quite frankly. So we would expect certain businesses that have a seasonality to them like Refrigeration that will deplete a bunch of the backlog between now and the end of September, because generally speaking retailers don\u2019t do a lot of installs in Q4 around Christmas time. But now, we will see if that\u2019s changed \u2013 the dynamics change this year. So on the longer cycle businesses, I think right now the trajectory is good is as we deplete, we are building into 2021. On the short cycle ones, I guess it depends on when we get to the end of Q3 and what the outlook for revenue is into Q4, but I don\u2019t see any anomalies in there.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Yes, I just wanted to make sure that nothing about some of the backlog conversion came at the expense of \u201821. It sounds like that\u2019s not the case. So, good to hear. Thanks. I will leave it there.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: Just a follow-up on the M&A outlook for the second half. And Rich, you talked about if it meets your return requirements, but typically in a downturn, there needs to be a process for seller valuation expectations to be reset. Do you think that\u2019s happened already?\nRichard Tobin: Not as much as we would like, but it is happening I think.\nDeane Dray: Was that \u2013 is that based upon books that are getting circulated, just how much...\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean based on books that are being circulated and whispered numbers about expectation, it looks like its better than it was clearly in the second half of \u201819, but you still have this notion that the public equity markets are trading quite well. And then so we look at a lot of private companies, because the market segment that we are in and then there is this, well I want because of trading multiples that I see in the equity \u2013 in the public equity markets, but that\u2019s \u2013 that never goes away, but it\u2019s improved some. It\u2019s not improved greatly, but it\u2019s improved some.\nDeane Dray: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the free cash flow for the second half and considering the strength of your free cash flow conversion this quarter, if you are liquidating inventory wouldn\u2019t we expect to see some really strong free cash flow conversions in the second half?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, if you look historically, we generate a significant proportion of our full year cash flow in Q4, which we would expect but with the caveat of \u2013 we expect to draw down inventories quite a bit this year in the second half just because of the lower revenue number. Hopefully, if demand improves in Q4, we may have to reverse that, but my expectation is, is that the seasonality will remain constant, but we are probably not proportionately the way it\u2019s been in the past when we have been growing the top line, where it\u2019s been highly levered to Q4, it\u2019s probably a little bit more evenly balanced this year.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then just last one on the pumps business, could you clarify whether the business is exposed to pharma, biopharma anything COVID related in your sanitary pumps?\nRichard Tobin: It is exposed to biopharma, a material piece of it and that\u2019s what has been driving the growth. And we are going to do an Investor Day around that particular business sometime, when Andrey late August, early September TBD?\nAndrey Galiuk: Yes.\nRichard Tobin: Where we will give you more color on it.\nDeane Dray: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 5. On the top is the revenue bridge. As Rich mentioned in his opening remarks, the top line was adversely impacted by COVID-19, with each segment posting year-over-year organic revenue declines. FX continued to be a meaningful headwind in Q2, reducing top line by 1% or $24 million. We expect FX to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year. Acquisitions were effectively offset by dispositions in the quarter. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects relatively more resilient trends in North America and Asia versus the more significant impacts across Europe and several emerging economies like India, Brazil and Mexico. The U.S., our largest market declined 10% organically with four segments posting organic declines partially offset by growth in retail fueling. All of Asia declined 14%. China, representing approximately half of our business in Asia, showed early signs of stabilization posting an 11% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, an improvement compared to a 36% decline in Q1. Imaging & Identification and Engineered Products were up in China, while Fueling Solutions declined due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate and also slower demand from the local national oil companies. Europe was down 19% on organic declines in all five segments. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were down 21% organically on declines across all five segments, but there are reasons for cautious optimism as we enter the second half. First, as presented in the box on the bottom, June bookings saw a significant improvement from the May trough, with all five segments posting double-digit month-over-month sequential growth. Second, our backlog is up 8% compared to this time last year driven by our longer cycle businesses and the previously mentioned intra-quarter improvement in our shorter cycle businesses. We believe we are well-positioned for the second half of the year. Let's move to the bridges on Slide 6. I will refrain from going into too much detail on the chart, but the adverse top line trend drove EBIT declines, although our cost containment and productivity initiatives help offset overall margins to hold up at an acceptable decremental. In the quarter, we delivered on the $50 million annual cost reduction program, which focuses on IT footprint and back office efficiency and took additional restructuring charges that add to the expected benefits. We also executed well in the quarter on additional cost takeout to offset the under-absorbed \u2013 under-absorption of fixed cost previously estimated at $35 million to $40 million. Some of these recent initiatives will continue supporting margins in the second half and into 2021. Going to the bottom chart, adjusted earnings declined mainly due to lower segment earnings partially offset by lower interest expense and lower taxes on lower earnings. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, is approximately 21.5% for the quarter unchanged from the first quarter. Discrete tax benefits in the quarter were approximately $2 million slightly lower than the prior year's second quarter. Rightsizing and other costs were $17 million in the quarter or $13 million after-tax relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into 2020. Now, moving to Slide 7, we are pleased with the cash generation in the first half of the year, with year-to-date free cash flow of $269 million, a $126 million or 90% increase over last year. Our teams have done a good job managing capital more effectively in this uncertain environment. We have seen strong collections on accounts receivables and continue to operate with inventories of supportive of our backlog in order trends. Q2 also benefited from an approximately $40 million deferral of U.S. tax payments into the second half of the year. Capital expenditures were $79 million for the first 6 months of the year, a $12 million decline versus the comparable period last year. Most of our in-flight growth and productivity capital projects were completed in the second quarter. So we expect to see continued year-over-year capital expenditure declines in the second half. Lastly, now on Slide 8. Dover's financial position remains strong. We have been targeting a prudent capital structure and our leverage of 2.2x EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment grade rating, with a margin of safety. Second, we are operating with approximately $1.6 billion of current liquidity, which consists of $650 million of cash and $1 billion of unused revolver capacity. When commercial paper markets were fractured at the outset of the pandemic in March, we drew $500 million on our revolver out of an abundance of caution. Markets have since stabilized and we reestablished our commercial paper program and fully repaid the revolver. In Q2, we also secured a new incremental $450 million revolver facility to further bolster our liquidity position. As of June, we have no drawn funds on either revolver. Our prudent capital structure, access to liquidity and strong cash flow have allowed us to largely maintain our capital allocation posture. We have deployed nearly a $0.25 billion on accretive acquisitions so far this year and we continue to pursue attractive acquisitions. Finally, we are lifting our recent suspension on share repurchase and we will opportunistically buyback stock should the market conditions dictate. I will turn it back over to Rich. Good morning, Scott. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning. Yes."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the summary of the results on Page 3. We expect that Q2 to be challenging and in preparation we reinforced our cost-out program earlier in Q1. So we were in some sense prepared for the battle. We entered the quarter with a comprehensive set of actions to manage through the turbulent times and focused on what we can control our operations, costs and importantly, safety of our employees. From an operational point of view, we are not out of the woods yet, but a significant majority of our facilities are up and running moving into Q3, which is positive to operating leverage as compared to this quarter. Top line trends are very much in line with our expectations entering the quarter. Revenue declined 16% organically and bookings declined 21%. Trends have improved in the quarter and we saw material sequential improvement in June. We still carry a strong backlog across all segments and that increases our confidence for the second half. Margin performance for the quarter was acceptable considering the state of business activity in April and May. After profitability gains in Q1 on lower revenue, we targeted 25% to 30% decremental margin for the full year. Thanks to the broad-based cost control efforts to offset under-absorption of fixed costs and steady execution of $50 million of in-flight initiatives, we achieved 27% decremental margin in Q2, a quarter which we expect to be the trial for the year. That puts us on track to exceed our initial full year target. In addition to the tight cost controls and variable costs, we took further structural cost actions in the quarter as part of our business realignment activities, which will benefit us in the second half. Along with our cost actions, our proactive working capital management resulted in cash flow improvement in both absolute and conversion terms. We generated $78 million more in free cash flow than the comparable quarter last year. As a result of our first half performance and our solid order backlog, we are reinstating our annual adjusted EPS guidance to $5 to $5.25 per share. To be clear, even with a strong backlog and positive recent trends, we still see demand uncertainty in our markets and are not back to business as usual, but our teams have proven their ability to manage costs and operations and we are prepared to operate and achieve results in a wide variety of scenarios that maybe in store for the second half. Let's take a look at the segment performance on Slide 4. Engineered Products had a tough quarter, particularly in shorter cycle and CapEx-levered businesses like vehicle aftermarket, industrial automation and industrial winches. Waste hauling and aerospace and defense were more resilient shipping against their strong backlogs. Lower volumes led to margin decline versus a very strong margin that this segment posted in the comparable quarter last year and we have taken structural cost actions in this segment, which will support its margin in the second half along with recovering volumes. Fueling Solutions saw continued strong activity in North America driven by demand of EMV compliance solutions, whereas Europe and Asia declined due to COVID-related production and supply chain interruptions as well as budget cuts and deferrals in response to the decline in oil prices. Increased margin performance was commendable with 80 basis point increase on a better mix pricing and ongoing productivity actions. The sales decline in Imaging and Identification was driven predominantly a steep decline in our digital textile printing business, which we expected in the significant dislocation in global apparel and fashion markets due to the pandemic. Marking and coding showed continued resilience on strong demand for consumables and fast-moving consumer goods solutions. This is our highest gross margin segment. So decremental margins are challenging and require heavy lifting on cost containment. Our marking and coding business did a good job achieving a flat margin year-over-year and we have taken proactive actions to manage the cost base in the digital printing business. As a result of these actions and a pickup in textiles consumable volumes, we expect performance to improve in the second half.0 Pumps & Process Solutions demonstrated the resilience we expected. Its top line declined the least among our segments despite a challenging comparable from last year. Strong growth continued in biopharma and medical applications with colder products posting record growth in the quarter. This was offset by a moderate decline in industrial applications and material slowing and energy markets. Our Plastics Processing business revenue declined in the quarter as a result of shipment timing, we expect for it to do well in the second half off a strong backlog. As you can see, this segment continued to deliver a solid margin performance posting improving margin on declining revenue for the second quarter in a row. We expect this segment to deliver flat or improved absolute profit for the full year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined as food retailers continued to delay construction remodels due to peak utilization and the commercial food service market remains severely impacted by restaurant and school closures in the United States. Our heat exchanger business showed resilience, particularly in non-HVAC applications. On the margin side, negative absorption on lower volumes drove the margin decline. In Q2, we took structural cost actions in this segment, which paired with ongoing productivity and automation initiatives yield in a materially improved margin performance in the month of June. We expect these benefits to continue accruing in the second half and expect the segment to deliver year-over-year growth in absolute earnings and margin in the second half of this year. I will pass it to Brad here. Okay. Thanks Brad. I am on Page 9, which is an updated view of the demand outlook by business we introduced last quarter. Here we are trying to provide you with directional estimates of how we expect segments to perform in the second half relative to the second quarter in lieu of full year revenue guidance. I will caveat that all of this is based on current reads of the markets and is subject to change as the situation remains fluid. First in Engineered Products, shorter cycle businesses such as vehicle service and industrial automation have shown improvement late in the quarter and the trends are improving globally. Additionally, aerospace and defense continues operating from a large backlog of defense program orders. Waste handling may see some headwinds driven by tightening of industry CapEx and municipal finances after several years of strong growth performance. Bookings have slowed in late in Q2 as customers paused their capital spending to manage liquidity. We were watching the dynamics closely, but we have started addressing the cost base in this business proactively. Fueling Solutions is a tale of two cities, North America, approximately half the business remained resilient both on EMV conversion and also willingness of non-integrated retailers to continue investing in their asset base. In Europe and Asia, integrated oil companies represent a larger share of the network and capital budget cuts resulting from oil price declines are having a more negative impact on investment in the retail network, plus recall we are facing a $50 million revenue headwind in China this year from the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate. Despite some of the top line headwinds with robust margin accretion to-date, we expect segment to hold its comparable full year profit line despite a decreasing top line. Imaging & Identification outlook is improving. Our service and maintenance interventions resumed in marking and coding as travel restrictions were lifted and we are seeing a resulting pickup demand for printers. Our integration activities with Systech acquisition are proceeding as planned. We started seeing some green shoots on the digital textile printing side, but we are forecasting a difficult year as global textiles will take time to recover. And Pumps & Process Solutions is expected to show improved trajectory from here. First, our plastics and polymer businesses will ship against its significant backlog in the second half. Biopharma and medical is expected to continue its impressive growth. Industrial pumps, a shorter cycle business, is expected to start gradually recovering. A material portion of demand in our pumps and precision components business is levered to maintenance and repair and aftermarket. The oil and gas mid and downstream markets served primarily by our precision components business continues to be slow as a result of deferral of CapEx and refurbishment spending in refining and pipelined operators. In Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we believe the worst is behind us for this segment. Bookings were relatively resilient for this segment and we have improved in June resulting in a robust backlog that we are prepared to execute against. We also saw growth is restarting the construction and remodel projects resulting in us being fully booked for refrigeration cases into Q4. Additionally, Belvac is scheduled to begin shipments against its significant backlog, which will be accretive to segment margins. Recovery in volumes along with cost actions we have undertaken should result in positive margin and profit trend through the remainder of the year resulting in the segment posting a second half comparable profit increase. Let's go to Slide 10. As a result of the fluidity of the COVID situation, we are cautious about guiding top line trajectory at this time, but everything points to sequential improvement from here across most markets. The proactive cost management stance we took in Q1 and continued in Q2 has positioned us from a margin performance standpoint. And today, we are improving our target for annual decremental margin to 20% to 25% as we continue work in the pipeline of restructuring actions, including those targeting benefits in 2021 and we are positioned well to deliver on our margin objectives. We remain confident in the cash flow capacity of this portfolio and are reiterating a conversion target above 100% of adjusted net earnings and a cash flow margin target of 10% to 12% compared to 8% to 12% target we had last year. The rest of the slide, Brad covered earlier in the presentation. I will conclude with the following. We have reinitiated EPS guidance as a result of our confidence in our ability to manage costs in an uncertain demand environment. We have a good team and they understand the playbook. Having said that, make no mistake, we are on the front foot from here on driving revenue growth both organically and inorganically. We have strong operating companies and a strong balance sheet with which to support them. This is not the time to hunker down and wait for the storm to pass, so we are equally focused on market share gains, new product development initiatives as we are on our main pillars of synergy extraction from our portfolio, all of which we continue to fund despite the market challenges. Inorganically, we have available capital to deploy and I fully expect to be active in the second half. In summation, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover again for their continued perseverance in these difficult times. And with that let's go to Q&A. Andrey? Thanks, Andy. We would have not given out full year EPS guidance without seeing June. That is how I think that we have mentioned that when we ended Q1 that June was very important in terms of what we thought the trajectory was. And so, I mean, I think that we went through the bookings change of June and made a variety of different comments about the business about the moving parts of who is improving and who is not. I mean, I don't want to go through all the companies again. We have got a few, like digital printing, like food service that have not improved and we don't expect them to improve. So at the end of the day that's not built into our guidance. But we called out a few of the shorter cycle businesses like aftermarket automotive for example, which has picked up significantly at the end of the quarter. So June was good. I think that we are pleased. It was material to the quarter earnings June. The profit the absolute profit in June was double what we made in April, just to put it in contextually. So I think if you go back and you look based on the I think whatever slide it is in here, the Slide 9, that gives you the color all the color I can give you in terms of the trajectory of the portfolio and the moving parts. Sure. Let's start with Refrigeration. We are booked into Q4. So it's up to us now to produce the product without have any frictional costs and based on the margin that the business delivered in June, if we can get that for the full quarter, I think, which is our expectation, I think we will be pleased. In addition to that, part of the large backlog that we have in this segment is geared toward Belvac. So we are on the front foot in terms of capacity expansion in aluminum can making and we are participating in that and we have got some relatively large projects that will begin building at higher rates in the second half. And in all honestly, I mean, if we put foodservice equipment aside for a moment, we don't have the hardest comp in the second half. It's not as if we exited 2019 firing on all cylinders. So we will \u2013 that's why we will do better H2-to-H2 on a comparable basis, but it's largely as a result of heat exchangers continuing to improve modestly over the second half, Belvac shipments and material improvement in Refrigeration cases. That's baked into the margin improvement that we expect in the second half. Thanks. Hey, Scott. Look, all of the relative decline or substantially all of the relative decline in the quarter is because of this double wall tank issue, which we had guided at the beginning of the year. I think that if we remove that, we were \u2013 I believe we were flat to slightly up on the balance of the businesses. So that's going to be a headwind for us in the second half. Scott, I have not done the calculations of what that means quarter-by-quarter, but we always had that $50 million headwinds that we were going to have to deal with. It's a bit slow on top of that in Fueling Solutions, just because the national oil companies in China are not spending any money right now. But if I \u2013 if we eliminate Fueling Solutions, the balance of our business which is mostly Printing & ID, have improved materially in Q2 and you expect that to continue for the balance of the year, and that's volume related, right. So as China has restarted and business activity started, you can think about marking and coding into the consumption of consumables and things like that. Over, I would say the last where are we now in July, over the last 8 to 10 months, we have had approximately $80 million of spending that were attributed to two projects. One was the automation project for Refrigeration cases and one was the brand new building that we built for Colder Products up in Minnesota. So those \u2013 I don't \u2013 we don't have anything in the pipeline of that quantum. So I would expect CapEx to slightly rise in 2021, but not materially as if we deferred CapEx in 2020, and we have got catch-up in 2021. Now having said that, what, if we have got the demand, and we get some projects in that we don't have in the pipe, we are more than happy to invest organically in this business based on the returns we get. Thanks. That is the new structural. So the $50 million... Yes. The $50 million was done and dusted and it was on average $13 million a quarter. That's what we got in this quarter and that's what we can expect rolling through the other two. The charge that we took for restructuring in Q2 was new. It was a project that we are working on. We just pulled it forward. So it will have an impact in the second half of the year, but that is baked into our EPS guidance. How about... Yes, I know where you are going. But let's \u2013 give us another quarter, because we have got some other actions in the pipeline. And when we get to the end of Q3, we can kind of give you some color of where we are tracking on the $50 million for 2021, but it's a bit premature right now. Yes. I think this is what we said at the end of Q1. While we are not just going to sit here and wait for the clouds to part, right? We are being on \u2013 we are taking some action on the front foot. These are projects that we had in the pipeline, and because the level of business activity that we had, we just said, why don't we do it now. So that action was taken. So they are incremental to the 2020 $50 million. They will accrue some benefit in the second half of 2020, and then we will redo all of what we think that we have got in the pipe for 2021 likely at the end of Q3. Well, look at the end of the day, the temporary cost savings as a result of managing bonus accruals, we would expect and hopefully to build those back next year. So those come back. On the variable cost, mostly in SG&A, I think the jury is still out. I think that clearly we like everybody else have recognized that. What we need to conduct business may be different in 2021 when we looked back historically. So we get ready to do our plans on the operating company level for 2021, the conversations we are having are operating company president is, this is a notion of okay, well, I can go put my \u201819 SG&A back as long as the revenue supports it, but I think it's a bit premature to kind of monetize that now. But clearly, we are thinking about it and I don't expect that we will just snap back from an SG&A point of view, back to \u201819 levels. Look at the end of the day, we had a $35 million to $40 million fixed cost absorption headwind that we offset with temporary cost \u2013 with cost actions, right? That allowed us to have more or less flat gross margins quarter-to-quarter. Then we offset 30% of the lost revenue with SG&A cuts. Look at it that way. Yes. Hey, Steve. We are going to get to a revenue number by hook or crook here. This is the interesting way to go about it. Look, I think that that we have got line of sight on the percentage of revenue and on the conversion of net income. I expect \u2013 we have exited Q2 with arguably inventory that supports the short, what we can see it for Q3. So I would expect barring a real snap back in demand, outside of what we have got baked into our numbers that will be liquidating inventory between now and the end of the year. I know where you're going. Look, I don't think the number that you put out there is outlandish. You have got your finger on it. I mean, I think that we clearly we have a tough comp in Q4 in DFS. So that will be levered to Q3. The swing factor is going to be where we are on the long cycle side, which is driven by Belvac and Maag, and then to a certain extent, some other companies in there. I hope that we are bringing a lot of that into Q3. And if that's the case then you would have a sequentially better Q3 and we are talking comp-to-comp here. Than Q4. So what's known is barring a \u2013 and look I hope it happens, but barring a real uptick in demand on EMV in Q4. Right now, our expectation would be that we are down in DFS Q-to-Q. But I think right now based on June we are probably trending a little bit on a comp basis better Q3 and not \u2013 and less so in Q4 right now. That's fair. Thanks. Hey, Joe. Well, look, I mean, as I mentioned earlier, June was materially better than April, but April I hope that we don't see again anytime soon. I mean April and May in certain of our businesses, which is a function, a lot of this issue about the declining backlog, I mean we were not shipping anything and we were not getting any orders either. So when we were looking at this decision about reinstituting guidance for the full year, I think that we have got a good playbook in control in terms of the operating cost side, but it was almost entirely contingent upon how June was, how June manifested itself, and June came in both on a bounce back in the order rates and in terms of absolute profit that portends well for Q3. So Brad's got the joke, if we can just keep having June's from here on out, we would probably be in good shape for the balance of the year. So that is about the color I can give you on it. Well, I mean, I think the hierarchy remains the same of organic investment, inorganic investment and then capital return. I think that the CapEx number that we have given you for the full year is relatively safe now. So it is going to depend on inorganic investment. And if you go back to the comments, I think that the pipeline that we have right now is relatively encouraging and I expect to be deploying inorganic capital in the second half. But having said that, if we are unable to get the returns inorganically that we seek then, we will address capital return and not sit on a cash balance here. Thanks. You know what, I don't know the answer to that question, because we were \u2013 everything that we look at around here is a function of relative declines. So, which is a \u2013 this tells you a lot about 2020 in the COVID era. But I mean, I think that the rate of revenue decline in June was significantly less than we saw in April and May, but \u2013 if I \u2013 of the top my head, Jeff, I guess the guys are furiously going through pages here, relative to seasonality I don't know. I think that Andrey is going to have to follow-up with you on that one. Other than bonus accruals, there is really no overhang of deferral of costs that have to snap back. I think the big question, I think there was a question earlier about it and I think this supplies, not just to Dover to everybody is, everybody has reduced travel cost right. Does it come back to \u201819 levels as a percent of revenue or not, I mean, the expectation there is absolutely not. I think that we have proven that we can run this business with less discretionary spending, than we may have thought is necessary exiting \u201819. So, what the quantum of that is, is I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but we will be reflected in whenever we give our guidance for \u201821 for sure. The rest of it \u2013 you look at the end of the day, I think that we did a admirable job in managing furloughs and a variety of things. So I don't expect that we are going to run significant industrial friction with over time or anything else in the second half. That's my expectation. It won't be perfect, but I don't see that our incremental margins should have any kind of negative drag once we get to \u2013 hopefully soon, back to growth. Sure. Actionable it's going to be similar size to what you have seen. There is some bigger opportunities that are out there, the bigger the opportunity, the more competition. So returns get tighter. So we will see on that front. But I am pretty confident on kind of the size that we have seen year-to-date. It's just a question of, can we close them in the second half. They should \u2013 well, I mean, let's start from the beginning here. In marking and coding, our margin which is substantially the bigger portion of that segment, our margins were flat. So, all of the decremental margin in that segment was from textile printing. And if we go back and take a look at sequentially last year, textile printing weakened in the second half. So, decrementals as long as marking and coding can hold their margin performance which we fully expect them to do should be less in the second half, just because of an easier comp. I think that the business management of that particular business has been on the front foot. The non-municipal business, if you go look at some of bigger publicly traded operators, they have cut CapEx because of the profitability headwinds that they have had on their non-residential business. We would consider that likely, just to be deferred into 2021 as they manage their own cost structure. On the municipal side, we don't see a lot of negative headwinds today, but considering the financing of cities and towns because of this COVID crisis, I think it's a better than even bet that there is some headwinds coming there and because of that I think the management is taking action on its cost structure to accommodate that today rather than waiting for the last minute. We don't \u2013 look, we are working on a variety of actions. I think we have got several footprint related actions in the pipeline, whether we will be able to action them in the second half or not, I am not entirely sure, but it's probably then a better than even bet that we will take some footprint related charges in the second half. But I will give you the quantum when we get it all done. Thanks, Julian. Look, I don't think in terms of what we expect to relative to Q2 those nice arrows that Andrey put on the Slide on Page 9 is kind of where we things \u2013 where we think the moving parts are relative to Q2. And then you have got moving parts, because quite frankly, you have had some businesses that are operated through the crisis relatively well. So, we knew the Pumps & Process Solutions, because of it's exposure on the biopharma side, was in a good position to kind of weather the storm as we got to the end of Q1 and it's proven that so far. We expected to act \u2013 to hold profits flat for the full year is our expectation despite the headwind on the industrial pumps side. The marking and coding, quite frankly, has had an excellent performance holding margins year-to-date. Look the textile printing business, it's just what it is, when you have your end market just absolutely blown up, we are just going to have to wait this out and that really will be hopefully a \u201821 story rather than a \u201820 story. So I don't think that we think anything different today than we did at the end of Q1 in terms of the relative resilience of the individual pieces in the portfolio. Yes. Look, I mean, I think you need to correct for dividend payments into the future, number one. And then after that, look, I think that we are not going to sit on a bunch of cash with negative yield on it for sure. But the buffer will flex up and down based on the probability of inorganic investment at the end of the day, right. That's going to be there. So if we are returning cash in Q4, it's because the pipeline that we see right now we don't have any short-term requirement to sit on the cash. If we happen to sit on at the end of the year, I think that you can almost can through that as a positive signal, because it means we may be building cash because probability weighting of the pipeline looks good. It's purely on the backlog that we have going into Q3. So I would expect barring a snap back in revenue expectations for Q4 that we should come down in inventory, in finished goods inventory and industrial inventory in Q3, some. Yes. I can here you. It was not a material headwind in Q2. Now, having said that, we were not making a lot in Q2, so the areas that we did have constraints, it wasn't like we were under the gun in terms of production performance. But for the most part our supply chains are relatively short considering the individual size of our businesses. So, we had a few headwinds here and there, but it was not material from a cost point of view in Q2. Yes. Well I guess it's going to depend on the trajectory of all of the businesses, because, look at the end of the day, we have done relatively well on input costs. So, as demand went down, we will be able to extract some benefits in raw material prices and the like remains to be seen. I think we are probably bought forward through Q3 and probably a little bit into Q4, but we have got to watch the dynamics. If business activity snaps back, then we can expect oil prices to go up, so transportation cost to go up and the like. So we will keep an eye and right now, but right now on an input cost basis, we have been a beneficiary, I think in terms of input cost year-to-date. Andrew, that's a good question. I will have to get Andrey to get back to you. I think on consumer goods we have seen decent performance which manifests itself in the marking and coding business. I think in heat exchangers, we exited on a positive trajectory from where we were at the beginning of the quarter. So, that's kind of industrial applications, for lack of a better word. But I would have to get back to you on the \u2013 and look and then we had certain businesses in the portfolio like automotive aftermarket that in April and May were absolutely very low levels of activity. So, June relative to those two months as improved, but I don't think we need to get overly excited because that base is relatively low. Hi, Josh. Alright. You have got me. We had a lot of the businesses that we are absolutely shut in April and May from end market point of view. So you have a reopening aspect to it, and that's why we were \u2013 when we were talking about the results of the end of Q1, we were basically saying look a lot of this hinges on whether we are right about June or not in terms of the trajectory and we ended up I guess, calling it right, for lack of better word, but our portfolio Josh, is so diverse, if any answer to that question is just not going to be applicable across the entire portfolio. So \u2013 which, quite frankly is a strength to a certain extent. I think, normal for lack of a better in the longer cycle business where it tends to be lumpy. The Maags of the world and the Belvacs of the world, they are actually building a back \u2013 a long cycle backlog into 2021 today. On the short cycle side, that is going to be more short cycle. So it depends on the trajectory between now and the end of the year, quite frankly. So we would expect certain businesses that have a seasonality to them like Refrigeration that will deplete a bunch of the backlog between now and the end of September, because generally speaking retailers don't do a lot of installs in Q4 around Christmas time. But now, we will see if that's changed \u2013 the dynamics change this year. So on the longer cycle businesses, I think right now the trajectory is good is as we deplete, we are building into 2021. On the short cycle ones, I guess it depends on when we get to the end of Q3 and what the outlook for revenue is into Q4, but I don't see any anomalies in there. Good morning. Not as much as we would like, but it is happening I think. Yes. I mean based on books that are being circulated and whispered numbers about expectation, it looks like its better than it was clearly in the second half of \u201819, but you still have this notion that the public equity markets are trading quite well. And then so we look at a lot of private companies, because the market segment that we are in and then there is this, well I want because of trading multiples that I see in the equity \u2013 in the public equity markets, but that's \u2013 that never goes away, but it's improved some. It's not improved greatly, but it's improved some. Well, I mean, if you look historically, we generate a significant proportion of our full year cash flow in Q4, which we would expect but with the caveat of \u2013 we expect to draw down inventories quite a bit this year in the second half just because of the lower revenue number. Hopefully, if demand improves in Q4, we may have to reverse that, but my expectation is, is that the seasonality will remain constant, but we are probably not proportionately the way it's been in the past when we have been growing the top line, where it's been highly levered to Q4, it's probably a little bit more evenly balanced this year. It is exposed to biopharma, a material piece of it and that's what has been driving the growth. And we are going to do an Investor Day around that particular business sometime, when Andrey late August, early September TBD? Where we will give you more color on it."

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich Tobin.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks Andre. Good morning, everyone. We are going to take some sage advice and briskly go through what was a solid first quarter and get straight to where we are from a market demand perspective, and what actions we are taking with our operations, cost structure, and balance sheet to adapt ourselves to this extremely challenging environment. I am not going to read the next slide, but will mention that the urgency and magnitude of the present challenge is not lost on us, and we are working through these times with resolve and a sense of responsibility to our employees, customers, partners, shareholders, and local communities where we operate.  We understand our role as a supplier to many critical societal functions like food packaging and retail, fueling, waste removal, and many others. Moreover, our businesses supply directly into projects aimed at fighting the outbreak such as commercial cleaning, masks, hospital bed and ventilator production, as well as biopharmaceutical therapy development.  Let's go to Slide 4 of the quick summary of the first quarter results. We recognize these results looking into the rearview mirror. Given the pace of change in the last few weeks, rest assured that despite solid Q1 results, we have zero complacency given the progressively challenging outlook into Q2.  To sum up Q1, our ability to remain largely operational coupled with the work we did in our cost structure and productivity initiatives more than offset the beginning headwinds of Covid-19 which largely impacted our businesses in China and Italy in the quarter.  Let's go to Slide 5 and briefly look at segment performance. Engineered products organic sales declined 2% as demand in auto exposed businesses had slowed down. The vehicle aftermarket business also experienced operational interruptions in our China and Europe based facilities. Waste handling continued to grow up with strong backlog. Digital sales in the waste business were up nearly 2x on a year-over-year basis. Pricing cost containment in response to lower volume as well as productivity actions resulted in a 100-basis-points higher adjusted EBIT margins for the segment. Moving out the Fueling Solution, saw robust activity in North America driven by demand for EMV compliant solutions, whereas Europe and Asia declined due to COVID- related production and supply chain interruptions and project deferrals. Additionally, manufacturing in our vehicle wash segment in the US was shut down in March due to local government mandates. Segment delivered 500 basis points margin improvement as a result of favorable geographic and product mix, productivity actions and cost controls, as well as pricing. Imaging and ID declined organically 4% in the quarter. Marking and Coding was approximately flat, and strong demand for consumables due to surge in production volumes of consumer goods in March, which offset the challenging additions in Asia in Q1. Our digital textile printing business had a difficult quarter as all of our operations are in the Lombardy region of Italy, which bore the brunt of the COVID-19. This was further exasperated by the sudden and significant impact of the crisis on the global textile and apparel markets. Margin in the segment declined only 80 basis points as our cost containment actions and favorable mix impact of consumables largely offset the significant volume drop in our digital printing business. Pumps and Process solutions topline declined 1% organically. Strong performance in our hygienic and biopharma pumps as well as in plastic and polymer systems and components largely offset slowing market conditions in industrial pumps and downstream oil and gas complex. The segment delivered another quarter of strong margin improvement, driven by cost containment and restructuring actions, as well as pricing more than offsetting negative impact of Covid inflation and FX translation. And finally, Refrigeration and Food Equipment, organic sales declined 4% primarily driven by weaker demand for heat exchangers and food service equipment, both as a result of governmental actions to combat the Covid around the world. Core food retail business declined less than 1% as grocers began to postpone remodel projects later in the quarter. Segment margin declined due to Covid-related production curtailments in Asia and in Europe, in SWEP as volume reduction in food equipment. From there, I'll pass it on to Brad.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks Rich. All right. Let me go to Slide 6. On top is the revenue bridge. As you will know FX was a meaningful headwind in Q1 reducing top-line by 1% or $23 million driven primarily by the dollar appreciating against the euro and also Brazilian, Swedish, and Chinese currencies. Bookings were up 1% organically and were similarly negatively impacted by FX and positively supported by acquisitions. Performance by geography unfortunately reflects the quarter's coronavirus outbreak around the world. All of Asia declined 19% organically; while within Asia, China posted a 36% decline due to significant mid-quarter disruption. Europe was down 7% principally driven by Fueling Solutions and Engineered Products. US, our largest market grew 4% organically with four out of five segments posting organic growth. We expect Q2 to reflect a year-over-year drop in demand in the US and Europe as Covid expanded into April. Also, we're watching cautiously for relative stabilization in China, although startup has been slow in some markets. Let's go to the earning bridge on Slide 7. I'll refrain from going into detail on these bridges for the quarter with three of five segments posting triple-digit basis margin improvement further helped by reduced corporate expenses. In addition to cost actions, margins were generally supported by mixed pricing and impacted negatively by first and foremost lower volumes, inefficiencies associated with operational disruption, FX, and inflation. Outside of steel and fabrications, which started to trend positive, we have seen material cost inflation in the quarter. Now on Slide 8. Cash flow is top of mind as we move into Q2. We're pleased with the first quarter cash generation with free cash flow for the quarter of $36 million, a $48 million improvement over last year. Recall the first quarter is traditionally our lowest cash generating quarter and typically shows negative cash flow. Our teams have done a good job managing free cash flow more actively in this uncertain environment and we expect to continue to proactively manage working capital into the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $40 million for the quarter slightly increased versus comparable period as we continue to execute our in-flight growth and productivity capital projects started in 2019. Most of these projects are slated for completion in the second quarter. Lastly, let me update you on our financial position on Slide 9. We believe Dover's financial standing is strong and positions us well to navigate the unfolding period of uncertainty. First, we have been targeting a prudent capital structure and our leverage at 2.2x EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment grade rating with a margin of safety. Second, we don't have long-term debt maturities until 2025, thanks to the refinancing effort we undertook in Q4 last year, which shifted out the maturities and reduced our interest expense. Lastly, we are operating with approximately $1 billion of current liquidity, which consists of about $500 million of cash and another $500 million of unused revolver capacity. We drew $500 million of our revolver in the first quarter out of abundance of caution when commercial paper markets experienced volatility in late March. Proceeds were used to principally pay off maturing commercial paper. We are back in the commercial paper market in April and will use cash from the program to potentially pay the revolver, if conditions remain stable. So in summary at this time, we expect free cash flow to remain strong for the company as we move into the second quarter. With that I'm going to pass it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Let's try not to put each other on mute. Sorry about that, Brad. And let's go on to Slide 10. Since we've suspended full year guidance, we'll dive deeper into current trading conditions and our actions over the next few slides. Slide 10, we will cover the current demand outlook as of mid-April and projected status of our operating footprint for the quarter. First, Engineered Products. As previewed in our Q1 results, industrial automation and vehicle aftermarket, as well as industrial winch markets are slowed and continued trending weak with material deceleration in March after positive January and February. We are taking capacity management actions in Q2 across these businesses to right-size our cost and working capital. Waste handling continues to be constructive as our waste municipal fleet customers operate as essential businesses and are seeing large increases in residential volumes, which are more truck intensive. In Fueling Solutions, fueling solution is a bit of a bright spot. Ordered trends have been robust on US EMV and the business saw good trends in March with some sequential slowing in April. Customer base is operational as retail fuelling is generally considered essential business worldwide and record high fuel margins on low oil price help operators offset the reduction in volume and traffic. On the downside, transportation of vehicle wash markets is likely to see delays in capital outlays during this near-term uncertainty. We are largely up and running in the segment except one vehicle wash facility in Michigan and a few smaller dispenser sites in Brazil, Italy and India. In Imaging and ID, digital textile printing will be challenged in 2020 as fashion and apparel markets deal with an unprecedented shutdown of apparel, retail globally. Marking, coating is held up in Q1 with strong orders in February and March. And we expected to be relatively resilient at 40% of the sales are driven by consumables tied directly to current production volumes in fast-moving consumer goods, which surged in Q1 and should sustain as consumers shift to home-based consumption of packaged goods. Parts of this business are not immune notably industrial end markets and printer and sale, service sales as our customers delay plan maintenance due to peak utilization or visitation and/or travel restrictions. We expect to recover such delayed sales at a later time. We are progressing with the integration of Systech which is responsible for the majority the backlog increase if we see in the segment. In Pumps and Process Solutions, while we are seeing sequential slowdown in the oil and gas market served primarily by our precision components business, trends appear constructive in military, chemicals, food and beverage, power generation and some industrial verticals, while biopharma and hygiene are areas of strong growth. Mod plastics and polymer equipment has not seen material project cancellation and continues operating with a solid backlog that equates to nearly half of their annual revenue base. We have a substantial spare parts business in this segment and large share revenue is derived from consumables or installed base replacement versus first fit capital construction. These should be supportive factors. And in retail and refrigeration and food equipment, this segment is facing the largest near-term demand headwind in our portfolio and its spread across several businesses within the segment. In the core food retail business, orders trended positive in February and March, but starting in March many retailers are forced to postpone remodeling and construction projects due to peak traffic volumes, local restrictions and inability of contractors and technicians to gain site access. The backlog in this business is solid, but the shipment timing remains uncertain. We expect that increased wear and tear of store equipment will result in a surge of volume of a frozen refrigerator products being sold will create substantial pent-up demand and we will be well-positioned to capture the rebound when it comes. Overall, we expect several quarters of mix to potentially variable performance in this business. Our Heat Exchanger businesses face both operational disruptions in Asia and demand reduction in HVAC industry globally, with material sequential slowing in March. Backlog is improved in the quarter, but we do see uncertainty here as we must wait for our customers to come back online. Our commercial food service business is facing significant demand challenges in the restaurant segment only partially offset by opportunities in the institutional market. It's no hiding here; March has seen unprecedented decline in order trends will manage capacity aggressively through the year with significant curtailments already begun in Q2. Let's go to the next slide. We have taken a proactive cost containment stance early in Q1. As you can see our SG&A cost has declined in absolute terms in Q1 mainly driven by travel curtailment and lower incentive compensation costs. And a quantum of these actions accelerates in Q2 which I'll cover on the next slide. We are progressing on our $50 million center led cost out program as planned with $13 million achieved in Q1 primarily from IT and a variety other cost items. For clarity sake, the charts are not fully additives at both include SG&A as you can see from the footnote. On the cash flow side, we are cutting CapEx in light a demand environment. We view $100 million as committed in non-discretionary spend, which shows you we have additional flex we have should the downturn be deeper and longer than expected. We carry over $1 billion of working capital in the business, which we scale down with revenue or better primarily driven by inventory management. After all that, let's get on to the most important slide in the deck, let's not sugarcoat this. Q2 is going to be tough despite a healthy backlog; we will be a curtailing or adjusting capacity down across a large proportion of our portfolio companies driven by the following. In some locations government mandates prevent us from operating. You can see in the business that this impacts the most. In several end markets that I touched on earlier, weak demand warrants curtailed capacity.  In food retail, we expect a significant portion of our backlog to shift to H2 as retailers continue facing operational challenges in executing their project as a result of heavy traffic and inability of contractor access. And in category four is driven by proactive working capital management and hedge against weaker demand environment and forecast. We have capacity to catch up the deferred production in the second half. In addition to the loss margin on lower revenue, these capacity reductions and curtailments will cause year-over-year comparative material fixed cost under absorption of approximately $35 million to $40 million in the quarter. We estimate that our variable cost reduction levers and flow-through on inflate programs will positively contribute approximately $65 million in the quarter, which would take you back to the previous slide of the offsets that we had in Q1.  On the cash flow side, we expect inventory management to contribute positively in the quarter. We do intend to pay the dividend of schedule in June and we'll fund both of the bolt-on acquisition of Em-tec in Q2. So to wrap up, let's put some directional guideposts out there for the year in the absence of formal guidance. The year can unfold in with a variety of different scenarios, but it will almost certainly be negative revenue change of yet unknown magnitude. We will focus on what we can control best our costs. We target full-year decremental margin of 25% to 30% of which we have a variety of actions to offset volume under absorption. You saw a glimpse of the levers in the prior two slides and we prepared a full arsenal of actions for the remainder of the year. On the cash flow side, we will reduce our capital spend with flexibility to defer more. We are targeting cash flow conversion in excess of a 100% of adjusted earnings for the year. We have suspended our share repurchases, but intend to continue paying a dividend and lastly our M&A posture remains opportunistic.  We will continue pursuing logical bolt-on acquisitions at rational valuations. In summation, I want to thank everyone at Dover for their perseverance in these difficult times. And let's open it up to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is faring okay through this situation. Richard, I missed the first 15 minutes or so of the call, but I'm just wondering a couple of things. Your comment on refrigeration and the difficulty getting jobs done. Are you seeing any other situations where it's the opposite? I mean fueling comes to mind, where there's less traffic at the gas station, perhaps it makes sense to actually accelerate and get some of this work done if the capital has already been budgeted. That's the first question. I just have a follow up.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Well, the first question, I can't answer it any better than the way you stated it. I mean the fact of the matter is that on the retail fueling side, that's outdoor work, so there's more flexibility, and it is an industry that is I forget what they describe them as is important, I guess or essential. So we've seen obviously no slowdown or any real material issues in terms on the retail fueling side. And on a refrigeration side, it's more indoor work, and because of traffic restrictions and everything you see in the supermarkets going on, I think it's understandable what's happening there.\nJeffrey Sprague: Then just to be clear on what you're saying on restructuring. So you're not increasing kind of the $50 million bucket so to speak, but you're doing these other actions on variable costs, G&A, and the like. Is that correct or are you actually stepping up restructuring and what's your scope to pull forward actions you may have had on the table for 2021 and beyond?\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Well, the $50 million is solid. So, you saw the benefit, I think it was $13 million in Q1. We expect that to be relatively even through the four quarters of the year. If you want to do the mathematics -- the balance of it is not restructuring, it\u2019s cost containment actions of variable costs, and unfortunately the direct labor costs of when we're furloughing and curtailing our operations. So, I wouldn't put in the restructuring bucket because it's more volume related as opposed to permanent cost takeout.\nJeffrey Sprague: And then, maybe along those lines. Other things that are not going to come back with volume recovery. There's other things you're doing in corporate or your view on travel in the future those sorts of things or should we expect all those kind of volume related savings to also swing the other way when we do get on the good side of this thing? \nRichard Tobin: Hard to say. I think what happens with travel going forward from here, but I would expect that 2021 would probably be lower than 2019. If you give every -- if you want an opinion on it, we are as we mentioned that we -- when we establish the $50 million for this year that we're building up plans for another $50 million for next year, we\u2019ll see how we progress on that because the fact of the matter is with everybody at home; working on some of our productivity plans has become a little bit difficult. And we've really had to turn the turret here to deal with immediate cost actions as opposed to longer-term ones. So I understand your question. I think let's get further into the year and I think that we can probably put some brackets around that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett.\nIvana Delevska: Good morning, guys. This is Ivana Delevska on for John. So I just wanted to clarify so the fixed 6% SG&A cut that would be incremental to the $50 million of cost cuts, and could you give us a sense of how much would that be in Q2 and Q3? And how are you thinking about it versus the volume decline?\nRichard Tobin: I would turn your attention to slide 12 in the bottom left-hand corner of the presentation that we posted, where it gives you our cost actions for Q2. We're not going to comment on Q3 yet. Let's see how Q2 presents -- progresses. Other than the fact that the $50 million of structural costs take out, you can divide by four if you want to model it into quarters.\nBrad Cerepak: And just for clarity, as we said on the chart, the $50 million is inclusive in the 6% down.\nIvana Delevska: The $50 million, okay. I get. Okay and then one follow-up. Could you give us a breakdown of your fixed versus variable cost structure ideally for SG&A?\nRichard Tobin: It's not a meaningful metric in consolidation. If there's follow-up question because the operating companies are so different in their profile, I think I recommend that you get back with Andre for some follow-up questions there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hi. Good morning, guys. I know it's early but is it impossible to think about -- start thinking about M&A here and particularly perhaps if there\u2019s distressed assets like food equipment, stuff like that.\nRichard Tobin: It's not impossible to think about it. Distressed assets are really, I don't know, if that's our bailiwick. I'm not taking it off the table, but if we were to go kind of what the timeline is in situations like this, the first things that come available are distressed assets. Everybody's going to hold on for a V-shaped recovery to see if what happens to asset values of some of the things that we were looking at last year. So, our expectation is what we'll see early on are going to be distressed. It's going to have to be really attractive for us to pursue something like that, Scott.\nScott Davis: Yes, and just that and if you said it, I apologize it in here, but how much down are the food equipment business orders? Is it magnitude like 90% or something? Extraordinarily high number like that or --? \nRichard Tobin: Yes. We didn't size it during the comments but it its very material.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nRonny Scardino : Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Ronny Scardino on for Joe Ritchie. So just first some restructuring, curious does the backdrop make it easier for you to execute on rolling out Dover business services faster to operating companies? Thanks and just one follow-up.\nRichard Tobin: Well, I think that anytime that you go into a situation like this that it heightens everybody's focus on cost structure for sure. But having said that implementation becomes more difficult with the stay at home. So it's a little bit more difficult. As I mentioned in my comments about deploying some of the people around to our businesses to start working on that. But having said that in part of our year-over-year cost savings DBS is a foundational pillar. So we don't expect it to slow down at all going into the --going through this year. And your next question.\nRonny Scardino: And then where across your portfolio do you think there could be more resilience in this downturn?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I think if you go back and you look at the slide that we prepared on slide 10 gives you the best window of how the business is performing both from a demand point of view and what our operational stance is. I think that should answer your question. That's more granular than generally speaking we give an entry year comments.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just help us understand what's happening in fueling solutions. The extent to which that Q1 bookings number, the strength was maybe something of a blip. Have you seen much in the way of push outs or cancellations around US EMV investments or you expecting those to occur? \nRichard Tobin: We have not and right now we don't expect. We expect some slowing in Q2 because we had to curtail our US operations at the beginning of April, mostly due to the Covid issue where we had to shut the plant down. Otherwise we would be up and running on the above-ground side based on the backlog that you can see.\nJulian Mitchell: I see. So on the demand front, you haven't seen too much disruption in the US even with miles driven collapsing and so forth?\nRichard Tobin: No. I mean I think that as we mentioned that at the close of last year, we said that there was one area with potential upside, it would be that EMV adoption has actually been accelerating into Q4 and that it continued into Q1 unless that stance changes. We don't have any reason to believe for a material slowdown. Now it's not going to be absolutely the same quarter by quarter. It's going to move based on orders, order intake and everything else, but right now we go into the quarter with a robust backlog. I think it will have less production performance in Q2 but that's on us only because we've had to take the sites down as I mentioned.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. Then my second topic would be around the DII segment. There is a very large amount of European demand exposure in that business. Maybe just help us understand how the short cycle trends in European DII or that segment globally. How have those been trending in the very recent past?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I think that we need to split that business between the printing and ID and then the textile side. The textile side is under enormous pressure. So much so that I would expect that is going to have a difficult full year, just what's going on in retail operations on textile demand? On the printing and ID side, it had a good quarter including Europe because of fast-moving consumer goods production and the amount of consumables that we are shipping. It's difficult in terms of the actual printers themselves and on the maintenance side, but as you may recall that was a business, a business that we expected to have a significant improvement in year-over-year productivity because of management cost actions taken in Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. \nDavid Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. What's been your experience on sort of the recovery in this pie chain and then the early demand recovery in China?\nRichard Tobin: We have, I would say not material issues in our own supply chain side. I think that had manifested itself earlier in Q1 when China was down. It took a little bit for the freight side of it to unlock. We have some challenges but they're not insurmountable and our comment and China is recovering, but it's a slow recovery in terms of the demand function.\nDavid Lane: And then on the potential for other curtailment during this quarter just sort of trying to understand how large or meaningful that could be in terms of the margin impact as you think about it.\nRichard Tobin: Well, I can't give you more information than we gave on slide 12 right; the curtailments are going to cost us between $35 million and estimated between $35 million and $40 million of fixed costs absorption alone. So that should give you an idea of the significance of the capacity curtailments we're going to take out in Q2. So I'm not going to size it more than that, but we are going to manage this business not hoping for, we're not burning down relative strength and backlog in Q2. We're going to make some bets on the linearity of the demand and in certain cases actually proactively cut production to manage the working capital impact.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me, guys? Look, I apologize if some these questions may not be full, I'm trying to manage two calls here, but what, have you addressed free cash flow, Rich, in terms of expectations for the full year and sources of cash from working capital and how that plays out through the year? So just wondering, obviously, no earnings guidance right now but how do you expect cash to perform versus earnings?\nRichard Tobin: If you go we would take a look at the deck that we posted on 13. We expect free cash conversion to be a 100% of adjusted net earnings for the full year of 2020. And that is going to be influenced by depending on market conditions, liquidation of the balance sheet.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And would you expect that to be a bit more backend loaded to liquidate that balance sheets or do you think that's got to be bit more Q2 along with --\nRichard Tobin: Well, you know what let's think positive for a moment not as backend loaded as in previous years because hopefully we're beginning to ramp up production in the second half of the year. So it may be a little bit more inverted because we're cutting production mid-year, which we generally are not that's usually what our highest capacity utilization is. So we expected to be more cash generative from a working capital point of view in the middle two quarters and let's think positive about Q4 and hopefully we're ramping up production in Q4. \nBrad Cerepak: And if any of you missed it earlier, we did take down our CapEx spending expectation for this year and as it says here on page 13, there's further flex there as well. So in our prepared comments we talked about our ability to continue to manage our free cash flow through this year with an expectation that we're going to deliver 100% against adjusted earnings. So how that falls out will depend on how fast we liquidate across the balance sheet right.\nNigel Coe: Right. Thanks Brad. Thanks guys. I did see the CapEx. So I'm not completely blind but in terms of pricing you did point 7% pricing this quarter. Just wondering if you can maybe just give the color in terms of what you've seen across portfolio on pricing? And if you have any concerns that maybe pricing has deflation towards the back half of the year. \nRichard Tobin: I think that we are concerned about it, but we haven't seen any kind of crazy pricing in the marketplace as a general comment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, guys. Rich just like following up on [Indiscernible] and just sort of the progress you made there with the automation project? And talking about the second half of the year with respect, I think sort of talking about the comment you made, you expect some mixed results in the business but obviously stronger demand, so how does that seen over time. So you've got a good backlog. Has been all sort of going together here as you go into the second half of the year? I think you start strong [bel vac] which is good margins. So I guess instead of continuing to ramble can you still do that mid-teens margin in this business or is it just tougher because of the mixed demand environment.\nRichard Tobin: The answer is, Andy, I don't know yet, right. At the end of the day, we've got a backlog in the refrigeration business that we could run out in Q2 and get all the production performance and do decently on margins in advance of the automation benefit which is in the second half of the year. But based on the signals that we're getting from the marketplace and the inability for our customers to actually do these projects, we are proactively taking down production. It's down now as a matter of fact in our principal sites because it just doesn't make sense to get the production performance and build all the inventory, right. So we'll see in the back half of the year. We believe that there's pent-up demand in this business. It's unfortunate because this was the year where we were hoping to kind of turn the corner and this Covid messes has really put a nail through it. So over the longer term, we're going to continue to work on the automation, so that doesn't stop. It's very difficult for me to say we're sitting here today what happens with the demand function meaning did we just lose a quarter here and that volume is going to bleed over into 2021. It's hard to say at this point, but I think it's better than even bet. On the balance of the portfolio, sure, a bel vac as we said was going to be second half loaded. And we believe that to be the case. The ones that are more difficult to predict right now is SWEP which is if there's been some earnings releases out HVAC already. So you know what's going on there. The industrial footprint of HVAC in Europe has been largely down during the month of March and into April. So we need that to come back so we can resume deliveries. And in food equipment, I think that we're just going to have to retrench for a period of time until all of this lockdown goes away because of the detrimental impact on the restaurant business.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Rich, that's helpful. And I didn't hear your comments on engineered products, but maybe you can sort of talk about obviously lot of businesses in there. So how is the for instance VSG doing in the sense that it seems like it more difficult business in this kind of environment, Covid impacted, so you've got a lot about half of that business that's auto focused in some ways. So maybe talk about some of the difference between that business versus waste handling and how the overall retailer business is doing. \nRichard Tobin: Look, at VSG being objective had a significant portion of the production shut in Q1 in Italy. So the performance in Q1 from a margin point of view was excellent. But having said that it is not those repair shops and everything else are not critical industries for the most part. And are dealing with this whole stay at home phenomenon. So I think the management is proactively taking down production in VSG into manage its working capital itself. But having said that that's aftermarket business. It's basically miles driven and everything else so we would expect that to not be bad in the second half. That's our expectations right now. Some of the smaller businesses like winches, as far as winches and things like that that's kind of, that's more tied to capital goods and that's going to go through a tough year.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Got it. And on the waste handling side relatively I mean you saw good backlog there.\nRichard Tobin: Backlog is good. I think that we're going to manage our capacity down in Q2. As I mentioned about burning down backlog until you get a line of sight. I expect that business to perform well this year, but I think we're going to take production performance down comparatively a little bit in Q2.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann with JP Morgan.\nPatrick Baumann: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Real quickly on the curtailments for the second quarter. The 10-Q mentioned that 7% of your major global facilities are shut completely as of April 17th. And 11% are partially closed or at lower capacity. And I know it's tough but is that a reasonable way to think about second quarter organic sales down maybe low double-digit or could it be much worse than that for any reason? Like is there a big destock in the channel that would impact you kind of more than what we're seeing in industrial production. Like it just curious any color you could provide on that.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. That's a good collage try to get Q2 revenue. Look, clearly the deteriorating conditions at the end of Q1 would say that they, and the fact that we came out and said I think on one of the first bullet points that we expect Q2 to be the most difficult quarter of the year when imply that revenue is going to be down exasperated by the fact that we're going to cut production so significantly. But I'm not going to size it for you.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. And on the free cash flow maybe. Could you mention, I mean, we talked about CapEx coming down and you're managing working capital in a few different areas. And then the filings also indicate something about tax payments being pushed out. Maybe if you could address sustainability of the actions you're taking and how we should expect some of this to revert on the other side when things get better? Like if the CapEx cut just the deferral of certain things that all come back. \nRichard Tobin: I think that the demand environment would have to change in excess of our forecast for the second half of the year for the CapEx to come back. So in a certain way I hope that we have to re forecast CapEx backup at some point during the year, but unless the demand environment changes more than our forecast to the positive, I expected not to come up.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes and the cash flow on the deferrals. I mean I think every company is going to see that type of activity related around the act. So it's not a major number. It's not a big number, but it is something and just speak there's also even on your personal taxes there's deferral of timing, but it's still within a year. So there's going to be some aberration on that but nothing that changes our view on free cash flow for the year.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay and then just, sorry to follow up that first question since I didn't really get an answer. The schedule curtailments, you said $35 million to $40 million of reduction in fixed cost absorption and then underneath that on slide 12 it says $50 million of offset actions on controllable costs, so is the net number then a $15 million, my taking the 50 minus 35 to 40 to think about the year-over-year impact. Like so you're fully offsetting those curtailment hits.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes. At the end of the days what's the revs down, you still got to come up with it. That's the number you're missing there. So the fixed cost absorption will offset.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes. \nBrad Cerepak: But you lose income on the revs down obviously, right.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes. Understand. Okay.\nBrad Cerepak: Back -- plan, so that's a point in time. That changes everyday. So you're trying to interpolate something there. I mean I think if we update that a week from now it'll be a different number either up or down depending on what the situations in facts are in any geo around the globe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Rich, I know it's still early but I was hopefully you could look ahead and talk about what you think might be some of the secular changes from the pandemic and how it would impact Dover's businesses? Any specifics come to mind. We've heard some general commentary about more reshoring, I'm not sure that makes sense may be carrying more buffer inventory. But how do you think these changes the structure of the organization and some of the emphasis on working capital and so forth.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I think, Dean that we, Dover are made up by a collection of medium-sized companies that don't really have the longest supply chains. So I think that some of the anecdotal comments about what's going to happen from bigger vertical industrials really don't apply to us to the extent that there is reassuring in a certain way I hope so because that's to our benefit in a lot of cases for some of our components businesses.\nDeane Dray: But then on Dover specifics, do you see any longer-term changes in retail fueling on like a commuter behavior as well as the supermarkets may be shifting to more warehouse type operations for food delivery. Anything on those fronts. \nRichard Tobin: Not anything different than we would have thought going into this crisis. No. I think that I don't think there's anything secular other than what we've been always watching at the end of the day. And I would argue that the least on the food retail, we would think that we're turning the corner, that it's more in our favor going into the future, but we'll see.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And just last one for me. No surprise that you maintaining the dividend. And maybe you just expand on the buyback decision on stopping for now. How much of that is in a consideration of liquidity preservation? Are you influenced at all at some of the political backlash that's associated with buybacks here?\nRichard Tobin: It's all liquidity. \nDeane Dray: Thank you very much.\nRichard Tobin: And when we get to these next few quarters what hopefully that everything's fine. And then we can go back to a capital returns.\nBrad Cerepak: We just think it's a smart thing to do, right.\nOperator: The last question comes from the line of Mirc Dobre with Baird.\nMircea Dobre: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Good morning, guys. Rich, I want to go back to the disclosure you provided on slide 6 where you talked about the geographic detail. And just sort of big picture wondering here I mean this whole Covid issue started in Asia started moving westward from there hitting Europe impacting the US now. When you sort of look at your business is it fair to expect that the US could be following a pattern similar to Europe or maybe even down the line your Asia business in terms of growth? Or do you think that there are some particular offsets in your business mix or operations that would make US look different than the other geographies?\nRichard Tobin: I would think that it will follow the same pattern, but I'd be careful about using the quantum of the percents only because of our participation in different regions like a law of small numbers. But without question and we were talking way we put the slide together, it's like you can almost watch this Covid-19 travel the world and we would expect that with the lockdowns that we had late in Q1 that are in exist today that that same pattern would come to the US or North America. \nMircea Dobre: So sorry to pressing on this but I'm trying to understand if Europe right now is a better benchmark for finalizing US business maybe Asia not.\nRichard Tobin: You can't only because the numerator and the denominators are all different. So you have to be careful about just using the percentages and saying, well, which one should I pick the 19 or the 7. \nBrad Cerepak: Yes. It's, as we talked about even the fueling business in the US is shown strength and continues to show strength. So it's not the same in every geo in terms of -- \nRichard Tobin: And I go back to the comment I made before. Make no mistake; Q2 is going to be tough.\nBrad Cerepak: Right. \nRichard Tobin: Right. And that's why intervening on the production base, so I mean what element you can put on it, but it's going to be a different. \nMircea Dobre: We all understand that we're just trying to do our best from the outside to try to get a numbers as close as we can. And sticking with fueling here, your orders were up nicely; your backlog is up nicely as you sort of think about your business versus the initial expectations that you set up for the year of being up 0% to 2%. I'm just sort of wondering what has worked out different than your expectations then where do you think we are right now in terms of the EMV upgrade cycle in terms of penetration. Thanks.\nRichard Tobin:  What we haven't had the time to run those penetration numbers. I think when we put the forecast together for 2020 we said, if there was one segment that we thought had some upside, it was going to be fueling solutions because of the order trends that we saw in Q4 about EMV adoption. Clearly, that is held in Q1. So it's better than we would expect but it was within the window of our forecasts. But as you know, we've always been, we spent a year trying to push this adoption rate out and now it seems to be accelerating whether that holds through the year, I hope so, but we'll see. But that's what's driving the backlog.\nMircea Dobre: No. I understand that part. I'm just wondering if we're in the third, the fifth or the seventh inning of this adoption cycle. \nRichard Tobin: I don't know. I don't know. Like I said it, we haven't had time to, with everything that's going on we haven't in time to size it from a total market and as we've said numerous times from a revenue point of view, it's all over the map depending on whether you're doing full dispensary units or just kits.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period for Dover's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks Rich. All right. Let me go to Slide 6. On top is the revenue bridge. As you will know FX was a meaningful headwind in Q1 reducing top-line by 1% or $23 million driven primarily by the dollar appreciating against the euro and also Brazilian, Swedish, and Chinese currencies. Bookings were up 1% organically and were similarly negatively impacted by FX and positively supported by acquisitions. Performance by geography unfortunately reflects the quarter's coronavirus outbreak around the world. All of Asia declined 19% organically; while within Asia, China posted a 36% decline due to significant mid-quarter disruption. Europe was down 7% principally driven by Fueling Solutions and Engineered Products. US, our largest market grew 4% organically with four out of five segments posting organic growth. We expect Q2 to reflect a year-over-year drop in demand in the US and Europe as Covid expanded into April. Also, we're watching cautiously for relative stabilization in China, although startup has been slow in some markets. Let's go to the earning bridge on Slide 7. I'll refrain from going into detail on these bridges for the quarter with three of five segments posting triple-digit basis margin improvement further helped by reduced corporate expenses. In addition to cost actions, margins were generally supported by mixed pricing and impacted negatively by first and foremost lower volumes, inefficiencies associated with operational disruption, FX, and inflation. Outside of steel and fabrications, which started to trend positive, we have seen material cost inflation in the quarter. Now on Slide 8. Cash flow is top of mind as we move into Q2. We're pleased with the first quarter cash generation with free cash flow for the quarter of $36 million, a $48 million improvement over last year. Recall the first quarter is traditionally our lowest cash generating quarter and typically shows negative cash flow. Our teams have done a good job managing free cash flow more actively in this uncertain environment and we expect to continue to proactively manage working capital into the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $40 million for the quarter slightly increased versus comparable period as we continue to execute our in-flight growth and productivity capital projects started in 2019. Most of these projects are slated for completion in the second quarter. Lastly, let me update you on our financial position on Slide 9. We believe Dover's financial standing is strong and positions us well to navigate the unfolding period of uncertainty. First, we have been targeting a prudent capital structure and our leverage at 2.2x EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment grade rating with a margin of safety. Second, we don't have long-term debt maturities until 2025, thanks to the refinancing effort we undertook in Q4 last year, which shifted out the maturities and reduced our interest expense. Lastly, we are operating with approximately $1 billion of current liquidity, which consists of about $500 million of cash and another $500 million of unused revolver capacity. We drew $500 million of our revolver in the first quarter out of abundance of caution when commercial paper markets experienced volatility in late March. Proceeds were used to principally pay off maturing commercial paper. We are back in the commercial paper market in April and will use cash from the program to potentially pay the revolver, if conditions remain stable. So in summary at this time, we expect free cash flow to remain strong for the company as we move into the second quarter. With that I'm going to pass it back to Rich. And just for clarity, as we said on the chart, the $50 million is inclusive in the 6% down. And if any of you missed it earlier, we did take down our CapEx spending expectation for this year and as it says here on page 13, there's further flex there as well. So in our prepared comments we talked about our ability to continue to manage our free cash flow through this year with an expectation that we're going to deliver 100% against adjusted earnings. So how that falls out will depend on how fast we liquidate across the balance sheet right. Yes and the cash flow on the deferrals. I mean I think every company is going to see that type of activity related around the act. So it's not a major number. It's not a big number, but it is something and just speak there's also even on your personal taxes there's deferral of timing, but it's still within a year. So there's going to be some aberration on that but nothing that changes our view on free cash flow for the year. Yes. At the end of the days what's the revs down, you still got to come up with it. That's the number you're missing there. So the fixed cost absorption will offset. But you lose income on the revs down obviously, right. Back -- plan, so that's a point in time. That changes everyday. So you're trying to interpolate something there. I mean I think if we update that a week from now it'll be a different number either up or down depending on what the situations in facts are in any geo around the globe. We just think it's a smart thing to do, right. Yes. It's, as we talked about even the fueling business in the US is shown strength and continues to show strength. So it's not the same in every geo in terms of -- Right."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks Andre. Good morning, everyone. We are going to take some sage advice and briskly go through what was a solid first quarter and get straight to where we are from a market demand perspective, and what actions we are taking with our operations, cost structure, and balance sheet to adapt ourselves to this extremely challenging environment. I am not going to read the next slide, but will mention that the urgency and magnitude of the present challenge is not lost on us, and we are working through these times with resolve and a sense of responsibility to our employees, customers, partners, shareholders, and local communities where we operate.  We understand our role as a supplier to many critical societal functions like food packaging and retail, fueling, waste removal, and many others. Moreover, our businesses supply directly into projects aimed at fighting the outbreak such as commercial cleaning, masks, hospital bed and ventilator production, as well as biopharmaceutical therapy development.  Let's go to Slide 4 of the quick summary of the first quarter results. We recognize these results looking into the rearview mirror. Given the pace of change in the last few weeks, rest assured that despite solid Q1 results, we have zero complacency given the progressively challenging outlook into Q2.  To sum up Q1, our ability to remain largely operational coupled with the work we did in our cost structure and productivity initiatives more than offset the beginning headwinds of Covid-19 which largely impacted our businesses in China and Italy in the quarter.  Let's go to Slide 5 and briefly look at segment performance. Engineered products organic sales declined 2% as demand in auto exposed businesses had slowed down. The vehicle aftermarket business also experienced operational interruptions in our China and Europe based facilities. Waste handling continued to grow up with strong backlog. Digital sales in the waste business were up nearly 2x on a year-over-year basis. Pricing cost containment in response to lower volume as well as productivity actions resulted in a 100-basis-points higher adjusted EBIT margins for the segment. Moving out the Fueling Solution, saw robust activity in North America driven by demand for EMV compliant solutions, whereas Europe and Asia declined due to COVID- related production and supply chain interruptions and project deferrals. Additionally, manufacturing in our vehicle wash segment in the US was shut down in March due to local government mandates. Segment delivered 500 basis points margin improvement as a result of favorable geographic and product mix, productivity actions and cost controls, as well as pricing. Imaging and ID declined organically 4% in the quarter. Marking and Coding was approximately flat, and strong demand for consumables due to surge in production volumes of consumer goods in March, which offset the challenging additions in Asia in Q1. Our digital textile printing business had a difficult quarter as all of our operations are in the Lombardy region of Italy, which bore the brunt of the COVID-19. This was further exasperated by the sudden and significant impact of the crisis on the global textile and apparel markets. Margin in the segment declined only 80 basis points as our cost containment actions and favorable mix impact of consumables largely offset the significant volume drop in our digital printing business. Pumps and Process solutions topline declined 1% organically. Strong performance in our hygienic and biopharma pumps as well as in plastic and polymer systems and components largely offset slowing market conditions in industrial pumps and downstream oil and gas complex. The segment delivered another quarter of strong margin improvement, driven by cost containment and restructuring actions, as well as pricing more than offsetting negative impact of Covid inflation and FX translation. And finally, Refrigeration and Food Equipment, organic sales declined 4% primarily driven by weaker demand for heat exchangers and food service equipment, both as a result of governmental actions to combat the Covid around the world. Core food retail business declined less than 1% as grocers began to postpone remodel projects later in the quarter. Segment margin declined due to Covid-related production curtailments in Asia and in Europe, in SWEP as volume reduction in food equipment. From there, I'll pass it on to Brad. Okay. Let's try not to put each other on mute. Sorry about that, Brad. And let's go on to Slide 10. Since we've suspended full year guidance, we'll dive deeper into current trading conditions and our actions over the next few slides. Slide 10, we will cover the current demand outlook as of mid-April and projected status of our operating footprint for the quarter. First, Engineered Products. As previewed in our Q1 results, industrial automation and vehicle aftermarket, as well as industrial winch markets are slowed and continued trending weak with material deceleration in March after positive January and February. We are taking capacity management actions in Q2 across these businesses to right-size our cost and working capital. Waste handling continues to be constructive as our waste municipal fleet customers operate as essential businesses and are seeing large increases in residential volumes, which are more truck intensive. In Fueling Solutions, fueling solution is a bit of a bright spot. Ordered trends have been robust on US EMV and the business saw good trends in March with some sequential slowing in April. Customer base is operational as retail fuelling is generally considered essential business worldwide and record high fuel margins on low oil price help operators offset the reduction in volume and traffic. On the downside, transportation of vehicle wash markets is likely to see delays in capital outlays during this near-term uncertainty. We are largely up and running in the segment except one vehicle wash facility in Michigan and a few smaller dispenser sites in Brazil, Italy and India. In Imaging and ID, digital textile printing will be challenged in 2020 as fashion and apparel markets deal with an unprecedented shutdown of apparel, retail globally. Marking, coating is held up in Q1 with strong orders in February and March. And we expected to be relatively resilient at 40% of the sales are driven by consumables tied directly to current production volumes in fast-moving consumer goods, which surged in Q1 and should sustain as consumers shift to home-based consumption of packaged goods. Parts of this business are not immune notably industrial end markets and printer and sale, service sales as our customers delay plan maintenance due to peak utilization or visitation and/or travel restrictions. We expect to recover such delayed sales at a later time. We are progressing with the integration of Systech which is responsible for the majority the backlog increase if we see in the segment. In Pumps and Process Solutions, while we are seeing sequential slowdown in the oil and gas market served primarily by our precision components business, trends appear constructive in military, chemicals, food and beverage, power generation and some industrial verticals, while biopharma and hygiene are areas of strong growth. Mod plastics and polymer equipment has not seen material project cancellation and continues operating with a solid backlog that equates to nearly half of their annual revenue base. We have a substantial spare parts business in this segment and large share revenue is derived from consumables or installed base replacement versus first fit capital construction. These should be supportive factors. And in retail and refrigeration and food equipment, this segment is facing the largest near-term demand headwind in our portfolio and its spread across several businesses within the segment. In the core food retail business, orders trended positive in February and March, but starting in March many retailers are forced to postpone remodeling and construction projects due to peak traffic volumes, local restrictions and inability of contractors and technicians to gain site access. The backlog in this business is solid, but the shipment timing remains uncertain. We expect that increased wear and tear of store equipment will result in a surge of volume of a frozen refrigerator products being sold will create substantial pent-up demand and we will be well-positioned to capture the rebound when it comes. Overall, we expect several quarters of mix to potentially variable performance in this business. Our Heat Exchanger businesses face both operational disruptions in Asia and demand reduction in HVAC industry globally, with material sequential slowing in March. Backlog is improved in the quarter, but we do see uncertainty here as we must wait for our customers to come back online. Our commercial food service business is facing significant demand challenges in the restaurant segment only partially offset by opportunities in the institutional market. It's no hiding here; March has seen unprecedented decline in order trends will manage capacity aggressively through the year with significant curtailments already begun in Q2. Let's go to the next slide. We have taken a proactive cost containment stance early in Q1. As you can see our SG&A cost has declined in absolute terms in Q1 mainly driven by travel curtailment and lower incentive compensation costs. And a quantum of these actions accelerates in Q2 which I'll cover on the next slide. We are progressing on our $50 million center led cost out program as planned with $13 million achieved in Q1 primarily from IT and a variety other cost items. For clarity sake, the charts are not fully additives at both include SG&A as you can see from the footnote. On the cash flow side, we are cutting CapEx in light a demand environment. We view $100 million as committed in non-discretionary spend, which shows you we have additional flex we have should the downturn be deeper and longer than expected. We carry over $1 billion of working capital in the business, which we scale down with revenue or better primarily driven by inventory management. After all that, let's get on to the most important slide in the deck, let's not sugarcoat this. Q2 is going to be tough despite a healthy backlog; we will be a curtailing or adjusting capacity down across a large proportion of our portfolio companies driven by the following. In some locations government mandates prevent us from operating. You can see in the business that this impacts the most. In several end markets that I touched on earlier, weak demand warrants curtailed capacity.  In food retail, we expect a significant portion of our backlog to shift to H2 as retailers continue facing operational challenges in executing their project as a result of heavy traffic and inability of contractor access. And in category four is driven by proactive working capital management and hedge against weaker demand environment and forecast. We have capacity to catch up the deferred production in the second half. In addition to the loss margin on lower revenue, these capacity reductions and curtailments will cause year-over-year comparative material fixed cost under absorption of approximately $35 million to $40 million in the quarter. We estimate that our variable cost reduction levers and flow-through on inflate programs will positively contribute approximately $65 million in the quarter, which would take you back to the previous slide of the offsets that we had in Q1.  On the cash flow side, we expect inventory management to contribute positively in the quarter. We do intend to pay the dividend of schedule in June and we'll fund both of the bolt-on acquisition of Em-tec in Q2. So to wrap up, let's put some directional guideposts out there for the year in the absence of formal guidance. The year can unfold in with a variety of different scenarios, but it will almost certainly be negative revenue change of yet unknown magnitude. We will focus on what we can control best our costs. We target full-year decremental margin of 25% to 30% of which we have a variety of actions to offset volume under absorption. You saw a glimpse of the levers in the prior two slides and we prepared a full arsenal of actions for the remainder of the year. On the cash flow side, we will reduce our capital spend with flexibility to defer more. We are targeting cash flow conversion in excess of a 100% of adjusted earnings for the year. We have suspended our share repurchases, but intend to continue paying a dividend and lastly our M&A posture remains opportunistic.  We will continue pursuing logical bolt-on acquisitions at rational valuations. In summation, I want to thank everyone at Dover for their perseverance in these difficult times. And let's open it up to Q&A. Okay. Well, the first question, I can't answer it any better than the way you stated it. I mean the fact of the matter is that on the retail fueling side, that's outdoor work, so there's more flexibility, and it is an industry that is I forget what they describe them as is important, I guess or essential. So we've seen obviously no slowdown or any real material issues in terms on the retail fueling side. And on a refrigeration side, it's more indoor work, and because of traffic restrictions and everything you see in the supermarkets going on, I think it's understandable what's happening there. Okay. Well, the $50 million is solid. So, you saw the benefit, I think it was $13 million in Q1. We expect that to be relatively even through the four quarters of the year. If you want to do the mathematics -- the balance of it is not restructuring, it's cost containment actions of variable costs, and unfortunately the direct labor costs of when we're furloughing and curtailing our operations. So, I wouldn't put in the restructuring bucket because it's more volume related as opposed to permanent cost takeout. Hard to say. I think what happens with travel going forward from here, but I would expect that 2021 would probably be lower than 2019. If you give every -- if you want an opinion on it, we are as we mentioned that we -- when we establish the $50 million for this year that we're building up plans for another $50 million for next year, we'll see how we progress on that because the fact of the matter is with everybody at home; working on some of our productivity plans has become a little bit difficult. And we've really had to turn the turret here to deal with immediate cost actions as opposed to longer-term ones. So I understand your question. I think let's get further into the year and I think that we can probably put some brackets around that. I would turn your attention to slide 12 in the bottom left-hand corner of the presentation that we posted, where it gives you our cost actions for Q2. We're not going to comment on Q3 yet. Let's see how Q2 presents -- progresses. Other than the fact that the $50 million of structural costs take out, you can divide by four if you want to model it into quarters. It's not a meaningful metric in consolidation. If there's follow-up question because the operating companies are so different in their profile, I think I recommend that you get back with Andre for some follow-up questions there. It's not impossible to think about it. Distressed assets are really, I don't know, if that's our bailiwick. I'm not taking it off the table, but if we were to go kind of what the timeline is in situations like this, the first things that come available are distressed assets. Everybody's going to hold on for a V-shaped recovery to see if what happens to asset values of some of the things that we were looking at last year. So, our expectation is what we'll see early on are going to be distressed. It's going to have to be really attractive for us to pursue something like that, Scott. Yes. We didn't size it during the comments but it its very material. Well, I think that anytime that you go into a situation like this that it heightens everybody's focus on cost structure for sure. But having said that implementation becomes more difficult with the stay at home. So it's a little bit more difficult. As I mentioned in my comments about deploying some of the people around to our businesses to start working on that. But having said that in part of our year-over-year cost savings DBS is a foundational pillar. So we don't expect it to slow down at all going into the --going through this year. And your next question. Well, I think if you go back and you look at the slide that we prepared on slide 10 gives you the best window of how the business is performing both from a demand point of view and what our operational stance is. I think that should answer your question. That's more granular than generally speaking we give an entry year comments. We have not and right now we don't expect. We expect some slowing in Q2 because we had to curtail our US operations at the beginning of April, mostly due to the Covid issue where we had to shut the plant down. Otherwise we would be up and running on the above-ground side based on the backlog that you can see. No. I mean I think that as we mentioned that at the close of last year, we said that there was one area with potential upside, it would be that EMV adoption has actually been accelerating into Q4 and that it continued into Q1 unless that stance changes. We don't have any reason to believe for a material slowdown. Now it's not going to be absolutely the same quarter by quarter. It's going to move based on orders, order intake and everything else, but right now we go into the quarter with a robust backlog. I think it will have less production performance in Q2 but that's on us only because we've had to take the sites down as I mentioned. Well, I think that we need to split that business between the printing and ID and then the textile side. The textile side is under enormous pressure. So much so that I would expect that is going to have a difficult full year, just what's going on in retail operations on textile demand? On the printing and ID side, it had a good quarter including Europe because of fast-moving consumer goods production and the amount of consumables that we are shipping. It's difficult in terms of the actual printers themselves and on the maintenance side, but as you may recall that was a business, a business that we expected to have a significant improvement in year-over-year productivity because of management cost actions taken in Q4. We have, I would say not material issues in our own supply chain side. I think that had manifested itself earlier in Q1 when China was down. It took a little bit for the freight side of it to unlock. We have some challenges but they're not insurmountable and our comment and China is recovering, but it's a slow recovery in terms of the demand function. Well, I can't give you more information than we gave on slide 12 right; the curtailments are going to cost us between $35 million and estimated between $35 million and $40 million of fixed costs absorption alone. So that should give you an idea of the significance of the capacity curtailments we're going to take out in Q2. So I'm not going to size it more than that, but we are going to manage this business not hoping for, we're not burning down relative strength and backlog in Q2. We're going to make some bets on the linearity of the demand and in certain cases actually proactively cut production to manage the working capital impact. If you go we would take a look at the deck that we posted on 13. We expect free cash conversion to be a 100% of adjusted net earnings for the full year of 2020. And that is going to be influenced by depending on market conditions, liquidation of the balance sheet. Well, you know what let's think positive for a moment not as backend loaded as in previous years because hopefully we're beginning to ramp up production in the second half of the year. So it may be a little bit more inverted because we're cutting production mid-year, which we generally are not that's usually what our highest capacity utilization is. So we expected to be more cash generative from a working capital point of view in the middle two quarters and let's think positive about Q4 and hopefully we're ramping up production in Q4. I think that we are concerned about it, but we haven't seen any kind of crazy pricing in the marketplace as a general comment. The answer is, Andy, I don't know yet, right. At the end of the day, we've got a backlog in the refrigeration business that we could run out in Q2 and get all the production performance and do decently on margins in advance of the automation benefit which is in the second half of the year. But based on the signals that we're getting from the marketplace and the inability for our customers to actually do these projects, we are proactively taking down production. It's down now as a matter of fact in our principal sites because it just doesn't make sense to get the production performance and build all the inventory, right. So we'll see in the back half of the year. We believe that there's pent-up demand in this business. It's unfortunate because this was the year where we were hoping to kind of turn the corner and this Covid messes has really put a nail through it. So over the longer term, we're going to continue to work on the automation, so that doesn't stop. It's very difficult for me to say we're sitting here today what happens with the demand function meaning did we just lose a quarter here and that volume is going to bleed over into 2021. It's hard to say at this point, but I think it's better than even bet. On the balance of the portfolio, sure, a bel vac as we said was going to be second half loaded. And we believe that to be the case. The ones that are more difficult to predict right now is SWEP which is if there's been some earnings releases out HVAC already. So you know what's going on there. The industrial footprint of HVAC in Europe has been largely down during the month of March and into April. So we need that to come back so we can resume deliveries. And in food equipment, I think that we're just going to have to retrench for a period of time until all of this lockdown goes away because of the detrimental impact on the restaurant business. Look, at VSG being objective had a significant portion of the production shut in Q1 in Italy. So the performance in Q1 from a margin point of view was excellent. But having said that it is not those repair shops and everything else are not critical industries for the most part. And are dealing with this whole stay at home phenomenon. So I think the management is proactively taking down production in VSG into manage its working capital itself. But having said that that's aftermarket business. It's basically miles driven and everything else so we would expect that to not be bad in the second half. That's our expectations right now. Some of the smaller businesses like winches, as far as winches and things like that that's kind of, that's more tied to capital goods and that's going to go through a tough year. Backlog is good. I think that we're going to manage our capacity down in Q2. As I mentioned about burning down backlog until you get a line of sight. I expect that business to perform well this year, but I think we're going to take production performance down comparatively a little bit in Q2. Yes. That's a good collage try to get Q2 revenue. Look, clearly the deteriorating conditions at the end of Q1 would say that they, and the fact that we came out and said I think on one of the first bullet points that we expect Q2 to be the most difficult quarter of the year when imply that revenue is going to be down exasperated by the fact that we're going to cut production so significantly. But I'm not going to size it for you. I think that the demand environment would have to change in excess of our forecast for the second half of the year for the CapEx to come back. So in a certain way I hope that we have to re forecast CapEx backup at some point during the year, but unless the demand environment changes more than our forecast to the positive, I expected not to come up. Yes. I think, Dean that we, Dover are made up by a collection of medium-sized companies that don't really have the longest supply chains. So I think that some of the anecdotal comments about what's going to happen from bigger vertical industrials really don't apply to us to the extent that there is reassuring in a certain way I hope so because that's to our benefit in a lot of cases for some of our components businesses. Not anything different than we would have thought going into this crisis. No. I think that I don't think there's anything secular other than what we've been always watching at the end of the day. And I would argue that the least on the food retail, we would think that we're turning the corner, that it's more in our favor going into the future, but we'll see. It's all liquidity. And when we get to these next few quarters what hopefully that everything's fine. And then we can go back to a capital returns. I would think that it will follow the same pattern, but I'd be careful about using the quantum of the percents only because of our participation in different regions like a law of small numbers. But without question and we were talking way we put the slide together, it's like you can almost watch this Covid-19 travel the world and we would expect that with the lockdowns that we had late in Q1 that are in exist today that that same pattern would come to the US or North America. You can't only because the numerator and the denominators are all different. So you have to be careful about just using the percentages and saying, well, which one should I pick the 19 or the 7. And I go back to the comment I made before. Make no mistake; Q2 is going to be tough. Right. And that's why intervening on the production base, so I mean what element you can put on it, but it's going to be a different. What we haven't had the time to run those penetration numbers. I think when we put the forecast together for 2020 we said, if there was one segment that we thought had some upside, it was going to be fueling solutions because of the order trends that we saw in Q4 about EMV adoption. Clearly, that is held in Q1. So it's better than we would expect but it was within the window of our forecasts. But as you know, we've always been, we spent a year trying to push this adoption rate out and now it seems to be accelerating whether that holds through the year, I hope so, but we'll see. But that's what's driving the backlog. I don't know. I don't know. Like I said it, we haven't had time to, with everything that's going on we haven't in time to size it from a total market and as we've said numerous times from a revenue point of view, it's all over the map depending on whether you're doing full dispensary units or just kits."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrey Galiuk: Thank you, [Tani] [Ph]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available on our Web site for playback through February 17, and the audio portion will be archived for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our Web site. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to uncertainties and risks. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thank you, Andrey, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on page three. We are thankful for the extraordinary efforts of our Dover team members which enabled us to deliver strong operating results amidst challenging conditions during 2021. We are also grateful to our customers who trusted us with their business while adapting their supply chains and business models to this rapidly changing and demanding environment. The resilience and creativity of our teams and the durability of our customer relationships were the key elements of our success this year, and we are committed to build upon those pillars in 2022, and mobilized to deliver another strong year of performance. All right, let's go on to the quarterly and full-year results. We delivered strong and better than expected results in fourth quarter and the full-year, posting organic revenue growth of 11% and 15%, respectively. Our margin conversion for the year was strong, and we delivered segment margin increase of over 200 basis points for the year, driven by volume growth, productivity gains, and our center-led enterprise capabilities. We are satisfied with this accomplishment in the face of the well-chronicled input shortages, supply chain constraints, and COVID-driven quarantines and absenteeism that became increasingly challenging during the Omicron period of Q4. As we mentioned in the opening remarks, we battled through as best we could under the circumstances, but we cannot help but be very frustrated by the continuing guidance on mandates and deadlines. It seems, often, that we have learned very little in the past 24 months. We complimented our strong operational execution with value-creating organic and inorganic growth investments. We deployed $1.1 billion in nine highly strategic bolt-on acquisitions, and also completed the divestiture of our non-core food service equipment platform, on December 1. These investments advanced our deliberate strategy to expand into markets with secular growth opportunities. Recognizing the recent changes to our portfolio and to better reflect the nature of the markets and customers served by our businesses, as well as the contributions to revenue, growth, and profits, we have changed the name of our Fueling Solutions segment to Clean Energy and Fueling, and our Refrigeration and Food Equipment segment to Climate and Sustainability Technologies. Looking ahead to 2022, we enter the year with constructive optimism despite the ever-evolving operating environment and geopolitical clouds. We believe that growth conditions are still with us, but it is critical that policies are enacted or not enacted to continue this trajectory. A methodical monetary tightening is deemed necessary, and I agree that it is. I would urge caution on the pace of any policy decisions in the regulatory environment or taxation if one wants to preserve GDP expansion trajectory. As COVID and its effects subside, we desperately need policy pragmatism with a bias towards policy that foster economic growth. Demand conditions across the majority of the portfolio remain favorable as evidenced by our strong sustained bookings in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, with the book-to-bill each quarter above one, even with the aforementioned double-digit revenue growth. Our backlog, of $3.2 billion, is up 84% versus this time last year, which allows us to better plan our capacity, production, and inventory; a major benefit in today's constrained operating environment. While we expect these operational challenges in supply chain and labor availability to continue into early '22, we do not expect operating conditions -- we do expect operating conditions and price material spreads to improve as the year progresses. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver robust top line growth, margin expansion, and EPS accretion in 2022. We are therefore forecasting full-year revenue guidance of 7% to 9% organic growth, and adjusted EPS of $8.45 to $8.65 per share. I will skip slide four, which provides more a more detailed overview of the results, so let's go on to slide five. Engineered Products revenue was up 16% organically in the quarter as demand remained favorable across all businesses. Vehicle Services posted a strong top line quarter, and market indicators remain positive. Environmental Services Group revenue was up year-over-year; with both bookings and backlog remain robust moving into 2022. Industrial Automation demand remained high, posting its strongest bookings quarter of the year, while deliveries were negatively impacted by output challenges in America and Europe. Aerospace and Defense posted a solid year-over-year growth, with good momentum behind our recent Espy acquisition, the recovery of industrial winches continues with all end markets trending positive. Despite the heightened demand, margin performance in the segment remains negatively impacted by the combination of input cost inflation and input shortages, with notable impact from COVID-related absenteeism, particularly late in the quarter where we ran at over 20% rates, in some instances, at the height of Omicron. In the fourth quarter, Engineered Products was the only segment that had a negative price cost spread, largely driven by raw materials and logistics costs. This remains our most challenged segment in the current operating environment that we have line of sight to improve margin outlook as the price cost spread turns positive in 2022. Incremental margin conversion is expected to gain steam through the year as we cycle through inventory, and we begin shipping off a strong backlog that was priced in the second-half of 2021. Clean Energy & Fueling was down 4% organically in the quarter against a difficult comparable from 2020, when we saw the high watermark of EMV demand. Additionally, volume was constrained by our customers' construction, labor slowdown, and component shortages, as well as COVID absenteeism in Europe. Booking trends and backlog in the aboveground business remain constructive, based on early market feedback and trajectory we believe that we have a winning pro with the Anthem dispenser. Conversely, demand trends for belowground equipment have picked up in North America, and deliveries and vehicle wash continued their upward trend most notably in access terminal and controller business that we acquired a year ago. Our recent Clean Energy acquisitions had a minimal impact on our Q4 results. However, backlogs in these businesses are strong. Margins were down in the quarter, primarily due to the lower volumes, product mix, absenteeism-driven inefficiencies and loss fixed-cost absorption. Full-year results in this business were strong and better than we initially forecasted early in the year on robust growth, productivity and favorable mix. Sales in Imaging & Identification grew 3% organically. The core marketing and coding business was strong on comparable volume though a short of components on some -- and some order push outs reduced volumes in printers. Our serialization and brand management software business continues to grow ahead of expectations when we're working diligently to add additional resources here, as we integrate and scale the business. The digital textile business continues its gradual recovery, and was up against a low bar comparable quarter, but it is still not recovered to pre-COVID levels. Q4 margins in Imaging & ID improved by 40 basis points year-over-year, as mix and price more than offset cost inflation and input availability issues. Full-year results were strong. The segment delivered 8% organic growth and 170 basis points of margin expansion are good volumes and productivity initiatives. Pumps & Process Solutions posted another strong quarter at 30% organic growth. Revenue for our CPC business was up double digits. We completed a clean room expansion project for this business in December, and anticipation of another strong growth year in 2022. Industrial and biopharma pumps were up on broad based end customer demand across all geographies.  We are pleased with the performance of the flow meter business within Em-tec, which we acquired in 2020, its biopharma sales have doubled in 2021. Precision component was up as the business continues its recovering on improving demand in their broader industry exposure. Polymer Processing was up in the quarter due to strong demand for palletizers and gear pumps as well as strong order rates and recycling equipment and consumables particularly in the U.S. and China. Margins expanded by a robust 740 basis points in the quarter and 790 basis points in the year on strong volumes, fixed cost absorption, favorable product mix and pricing. Top line results in Climate & Sustainability Technologies continue to be robust posting 13% organic growth. SWEP our heat exchange of business capped off the year, posting all-time records and bookings revenue and margin and carries a strong backlog into 2022. The business was strong across all geographies and end markets with particularly favorable demand in the EMEA for heat pumps, driven by regulatory requirements. We have been adding additional capacity in several geographies to meet forecasted future demand. Belvac, our provider production solutions for beverage packaging posted a revenue decline in the fourth quarter on difficult comparable driven by project timing. As we know, this business was up significantly in 2021, part of a multi-year secular shift toward more environmentally friendly aluminum cans with demand far exceeding the current installed capacity. Demand in our food retail business remains robust with elevated bookings and backlog levels. Our systems business in the U.S. and Europe continued its robust growth in deliveries and orders for natural CO2 refrigeration systems. Demand for door cases remained elevated as well. However, we continue to face labor constraints and subcomponent supply shortages that delayed shipments which necessitated intermitted production curtailments negatively impacting margins. We've instituted a number of price increases, which we expect to positively contribute to margins and conversion into 2022. Margins were flat, largely flat as the quarter as excellent operating performances swept, offset refrigeration headwinds despite the smaller revenue base. This segment demonstrated good progress in 2021, 22% of growth after a very modest 3% decline in 2020 and 230 basis point margin expansion despite multiple operational challenges as the year presented. With a strong backlog, we expect a continued robust progress in 2022. And I'll pass it on to Brad.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich, and good morning everyone. Let's go to slide six. On the top is the Revenue Bridge. Our top line organic revenue increased by 11% in the quarter, with all segments, except Clean Energy & Fuel posting growth. FX was a 1% or 12 million headwind to the top line, M&A added $17 million net to the to the top line in the quarter, a product of $26 million from acquisitions partially offset by $9 million from the Unified Brands divestiture. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North American and Asia, and solid growth across Europe and the rest of the world. The U.S., our largest market posted 16% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions and industrial [wrenches] [Ph], vehicle aftermarket, biopharma, and polymer processing. All of Asia was up 15% organically, and growth in biopharma, industrial pumps, marketing, coding, and heat exchangers. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia, was up 17% organically in the quarter. Europe grew by 7% in the quarter on strong shipments and precision components, biopharma, industrial pumps, natural refrigerant systems, and heat exchangers for heat pumps, partially offset by order timing in sustainable beverage can making. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were up 22% organically in the quarter, reflecting continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. Bookings helped drive our consolidated backlog to $3.2 billion, up 15% sequentially, inclusive of backlogs from our recent acquisitions. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across four of the five segments. Let's go to the earning bridges on slide seven. On the top chart, adjusting segment EBIT was up $47 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved 60 basis points as improved volumes continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation and production stoppages. On the bottom of the chart, adjusted net earnings improved by $34 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher corporate expenses and higher taxes. Deal expenses primarily related to our clean energy acquisitions were 11 million in the quarter, representing approximately $0.06 of adjusted EPS headwind. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits and gains on the sale of businesses was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.1% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $10.3 million for the quarter, or $2.1 million higher than 2020, for approximately $0.01 year over year EPS impact. After-tax right-sizing and other costs were 22 million in the quarter reflective of our ongoing productivity and right-sizing initiatives, including non-cash asset charges of approximately $16 million. Now on slide eight. In 2021, we generated $944 million of free cash flow, a slight increase over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 12% of revenue for the year despite and over $300 million investment in working capital. As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customer's strong order rates, and we are carrying high inventory levels to ensure we can meet the current demand into next year. With that, I'm going to pass it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay, thanks, Brad. I'm on slide nine, which shows our progress in 2021 against the capital allocation priorities we outlined at our Investor Day in 2019. We have a strong collection of businesses, and our first priority is ensuring we can continue to win in the market through organic investments, supporting growth capacity, digitization, innovation, and productivity. We deployed over $170 million capital expenditure in 2021 towards growth and productivity enhancements, as well as maintenance of our asset base. Notably, we invested over $14 million in digital products and digital and e-commerce, which allow us to reach our goal of over 1 billion in e-commerce revenue last year with no touch by customer service. This represents over 10 times the volume we processed in 2018. And our 2020 goal is to double our 2021 volume. Our next priority is inorganic growth. Last year, we deployed 1.1 billion into nine highly synergistic bolt-on acquisitions including two larger deals Acme, and RegO, which we closed in December. All these acquisitions enhance our portfolio by increasing our exposure to markets with structural demand, growth, outlook. Our pipeline, and acquisition capacity remains strong and we expect to remain active on this front in 2022. Our third priority is to return capital to our shareholders that we again raised our dividend in 2021 as we have done for the past 66 years Let's move to Slide 10, we provide more color and some of our organic investments. So, I won't go into the specifics any of these projects individually, but you'll see that our investments are substantial in size and represent a broad variety of productivity improvement and digitization initiatives as well as investments and capacity expansion, and new product development projects. These investments provide compelling financial returns and our proactive capacity expansions have allowed us to win share in the tight supply market. Slide 11 includes our current view of demand outlook and operational environment for 2022 by summit segment and how margin drivers are expected to trend over time and provides context of how we're thinking about our full-year guidance, which I'll get to shortly. We expect top line and engineered products to remain robust based on solid backlog and sustain high bookings across the business. All market indicators and vehicle aftermarket continue to remain positive and miles driven having fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels and used cars prices remaining elevated. Orders for rough use trucks and software solutions are robust, with new order rates pushing well into the second-half of '22, momentum and industrial automation and industrial witches should continue on the back of the solid bookings quarter of all end markets contributing to growth aerospace and defense is expecting growth on positive order trends largely driven by Europe. We expect headwinds from negative cost to continue in the first-half of the year getting sequentially better as the year progressed. We expect this segment to be the only one with negative price cost spread in the first quarter. Input availability, mostly labor absenteeism, freeze from recent Omicron surge is expected to negatively impact production efficiency in the first quarter, but should subside for the balance of the year. All in we expect margins for the segment in the first-half of the year to largely mirror the second-half of '21, then to improve meaningfully for the full-year driven by volume leverage and pricing. We expect clean energy and fueling to post low single-digit organic growth for the full-year on solid growth and below ground vehicle wash and software solutions. Demand outlook and bookings of our recently acquired clean energy businesses are very robust and they are off to a good start. As you know, we don't adjust acquisition related amortization out of our adjusted segment earnings margins due to sizable acquisition related amortization charges from our recent deals in the segment, the operating margin will be compressed in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding about 40 million of incremental deal-related amortization expenses and '22, we expect full-year margin conversion to be in line with broader portfolio. Demand conditions in imaging and identification are expected to continue the positive trajectory into 2022. Our core marketing and coding business expect to maintain its steady GDP like growth rate, serialization and brand protection software should contribute positively to robust -- on robust bookings and backlog. Digital textile printing is recovering and is expect to take another year or two to reach pre-pandemic levels as apparel producers take a cautious stance with new capital outlays. We expect margin in the segment to continue to improve in 2022. Pumps and process solutions should see another year of solid performance. Demand for biopharma applications remains robust driven by demand for COVID vaccines, as well as growth in cell and gene therapies and expansion of MRNA technology to other applications. We are completing the second phase of our cleanroom expansions and automation to ensure we can keep up with demand and we have broken ground on the construction of a new facility. Additionally, our connector business is experiencing robust growth in new thermal applications such as data center and supercomputing and EV charging. Trading conditions and industrial pumps are strong driven by robust and customer demand, plastics and polymers equipment business carries a solid backlog into 2022 with good market conditions and visibility especially in China, the U.S. and recycling solutions. Precision components continued its upward trajectory aided by OEM new builds and increasing activities at refineries and petrochemical plants. We expect margin performance to remain robust for the segment on volume growth, operational execution and positive price cost dynamics and climate and sustainability technologies we expect to post high single digit organic growth this year driven by its large backlog, and sustained elevated order rates, new orders and core food retail business have been healthy across product segments and the tailwinds from our leadership position and natural refrigerants are driving outsized growth of our CO2 systems business. As Omicron induced labor shortages abate in the first quarter, we expect volumes of door cases to recover with backlog stretching well into the second-half of the year. Our heat exchanger businesses positioned well on strong order rates across all geographies. Our Belvac packaging business continues to work through its record backlog. They are booked for 2022 and are taking orders for 2023. We expect to have our new R&D center and full can line completed in the first-half of the year. We expect margins to improve significantly in 2022. As improved volume leverage positive, price cost dynamics, productivity gains from our automation initiatives, and positive product and business mix should more than offset any lingering operational challenges related to component and labor shortages in the first quarter. All right, so before wrapping up and move into Q&A, let's try to square the circle here and sum up all the moving parts from our 2021 position to our full-year guidance. At the opening of this call, I said our results were better than expected. That was not a reference to external consensus estimates, but a comment about our operating margin performance versus our internal forecasts. Without the significant Omicron production and productivity losses which were not in our base forecast, we would have shipped more product in Q4 resulting in higher sales and cash flow, but lower consolidated margin on product mix. As a result of this, while we do get the benefit of carrying higher backlogs into 2022, we have not cleared as much higher cost inventory and have not realized all the benefits of past pricing actions embedded in that backlog. This will result in the calendar re-visitation of absolute earnings and earnings growth and especially segment operating margin being more back end loaded. And a typical year as a result of this date delayed backlog for us. A few implications of this dynamic, number one we approved an operating margin expectations for Q1 and encourage those modeling quarterly forecasts to exercise the same level of prudence. Number two, it is a good sign of backlogs gradually deplete during the year as it will be driven by higher production performance as labor availability and supply chains improve. Lastly, if both these dynamics play out as forecasted, we can expect inventory levels to drop supporting increased operating cash flow in 2022. So let's move to slide 13, which hopefully removes the quarterly noise and gives us some view of post pandemic full-year performance. Here we provide a bridge between our adjusted EPS in 2021 and 2022. We expect to generate double-digit EPS growth again this year driven by solid organic top line growth, much of which is currently in backlog as well as healthy full-year margin conversion and the positive impact from acquisition close in 2021. And so let's wrap up to Slide 14 to put our results and guide into the longer-term perspective. Our strategy has driven significant value creation for our shareholders over the last several years, as evidenced by the total shareholder return driven by underappreciated top line growth, cumulative margin expansion of 440 basis points, healthy cash flow generation and capital redeployment. We believe that our playbook offers us significant runway to continue delivering attractive cycle requirements over the coming years. And with that let us move to the Q&A. Andrey?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Scott.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi, Scott.\nScott Davis: There was a lot of detail on there, and I'd be lying if I said I followed every single word. But maybe we can start with just a little bit more color. It seems like this absenteeism and cost issues kind of lingering into 1Q here. Is it getting -- are things getting any better or are they just as bad now as they were kind of in 4Q -- \nRichard Tobin: Well, I guess -- yes, I guess, now that we've disposed with the federal mandate, hopefully, I mean that was not helpful at all, it is getting better. I think that the quarantine period being halved has helped. So, it's not as bad as the peak, which was probably in December, but it is lingering somewhat into January, but it's not as bad.\nScott Davis: This cash flow guide is pretty solid. Does that imply there's going to be some work-down on working capital or are you at working capital levels that are kind of more, I would say, new normal given the supply chain messes out there or do you have some flush-out in '22?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I mean I -- look, we expected to ship that. Now, whether we would have been caught up in receivables, who is to say? But my view is we would have expected to maybe have a slight increase in inventory based on the revenue. But our expectation for 2022, if we get this right, which we expect we will, is that we're going to give back that build net of revenue increase for the year. So, I expect to do better in working capital in 2022 than we did in '21.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes, I would just add I think we have a modest forecast of inventory drawdown. Depending on how the year progresses, there could be come incremental there.\nScott Davis: Good luck, guys. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go now to Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: You guys should change your name to Dover Technologies or something like that, or soft -- actually not now because the growth is now selling off, so, say, maybe something different. The change in the name is interesting though. Does that mean you're keeping refrigeration?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, it's in our forecast for 2022.\nSteve Tusa: Okay.\nRichard Tobin: Look, at the end of the day is we can't call it Food Equipment anymore since we disposed of the food equipment business. So, by and large, we had to rename it. The fact of the matter is, and I don't want to get cheeky about ESG-driven nomenclature here, is that the fastest growing portions of that segment are in sustainability technologies, it's SWEP, and our CO2 systems, and Belvac, which are all driven, we would argue, by a shift to meet ESG compliance, whether that's regulatory-driven or driven by other matters. So, I get it, it looks a little bit cheeky on our part, but it is what's growing within the portfolio.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. And then, you mentioned, I think, asking us to use prudence in our modeling is a lot to ask, I think. Can you be a little more specific about kind of like first quarter, maybe even second quarter kind of dynamics on sales and margins?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I think that that first quarter will look more or less like Q4. I think that it'll move around a little bit, segment by segment, and I would imagine a little bit better than Q4. But, at the end of the day, some of the headwinds we had in Q4 we're going to carry into Q1, a lot of that driven by, as Scott asked, the lingering effects of absenteeism, which we're still dealing with a little bit right now. Logistics costs haven't come down a lot. But more importantly, because of our inability to flush backlog in Q4, what we would have expected to be catching up on price cost dynamic is a bit delayed. But that's all -- that's all incorporate into our -- the full-year number.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. And what do you mean by that as on an absolutely basis, what you're talking about?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, on an absolute basis.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin: All right, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thanks. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nJeff Sprague: Hey. Just back on the new Clean Tech segment, whether or not the refrigeration stays or go, I wouldn't expect you to address today, Rich, necessarily. But do you actually see scope to do some additions in that area? You have legitimately transformed the Fueling segment, right, with some interesting deals. Are there kinds of logical extensions to SWEP or Belvac or other things that are adjacent to those businesses that could be in your M&A pipeline?\nRichard Tobin: There are. But the beauty of those two businesses is the fact that they're so concentrated in terms of the supply base. So, there's not a lot of M&A you can really do. But if you look where we've been spending organic capital, we've actually been deploying proportionately quite a bit to SWEP and Belvac on organic capacity expansion. So, I'm not ruling M&A out because there are some interesting adjacencies around it, but what we've been doing is just investing behind growth. And I think that SWEP will be finishing, in 2022, an expansion in all four of the geographies they participate in, for example. And I think that we've put in 15 years worth of CapEx into Belvac over the last 18 months or so. So, it's more of organic play, I think.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. And just on the pumps business, I mean the results really are quite remarkable. To what extent would you say there's temporary COVID benefits running through biopharma or do you just see more of kind of a broader wave of investment and displacement of kind of, maybe, non-disposable technologies and other things driving that business? So, I guess the question is really just around the sustainability of these growth rates?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, well, the growth rates are going to come down. I mean let's call a spade a spade here. I mean, everything get clocked in for, what, 30% for the year, something like that. So, they're going to come down over time. And we don't have that kind of growth rate for that business embedded into our forecast for 2022. We also do not embed in our forecast any margin dilution because of COVID demand roll-off, because we think that the fundamental demand for the -- for those products is solid. And I would have hoped that [Danaher] [Ph] could have done a better job talking about it since they are a market participant in the same space. We believe that the growth rate will come down as COVID demand begins to roll off. We don't envision it going negative in '22, nor do we think that margins are going to be negatively impacted.\nJeff Sprague: And maybe just last one, just back on price cost. So, it sounds like the entire company should be price-cost positive in Q2. Is that correct? And when you're talking about price-cost I guess flipping into the positive, are we talking dollars, margins, or both?\nRichard Tobin: The answer to the first question is yes, so the entire company in Q2. And yes again in terms of margin enhancement, especially in Engineered Products.\nJeff Sprague: Great, thanks for the color.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hey, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Hey. Just a question in terms of just [hopes on] [Ph] biopharma and just internal organic CapEx opportunities versus M&A, just how much growth can you drive organically by expanding biopharma capacity? And just thinking beyond COVID, do you think there is a real opportunity there?\nRichard Tobin: I hope so since we're greenfielding a new facility for it right now, as we speak. Yes, look, I mean we were not able to keep up with customer demand in '21. I think that we did better than some of our competitors, meaning, I think, that we captured growth opportunities. But even with that capture, I think that we were, at certain points of the year disappointing our customers with our ability to serve. So, that was what drove the decision about expanding capacity. And I think, we greenfield the facility up in Minneapolis in 2019, it's sold out. So, that's why we're expanding there. And in our disposable pump business in Germany, we are bringing assembly operations with expansion to clean room in the United States for that particular product. So, our preferred path is inorganic investment to dry growth, because that's where our returns are the highest, but having, and as we've discussed many times, look, there's no secret that these are really interesting pieces of the market and they attract very high pricing. So, we're going to have to be selective on the M&A side. I think we have some interesting things that we're looking at for sure, but I think that we can do this simultaneously inorganic and organic.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a question on your business model, a, you're growing the e-commerce sales, I think over $1 billion, imagine you getting some sales efficiencies, but just a, how far can you take this model? And b, is there a generally greater structural ability to go direct to customers versus through distribution post-COVID? Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Well, let me answer the second one -- second question first, because it's easier. No, I don't think -there's a -- our plan here is not to go around distribution. Our plan here to put in e-commerce platforms is a couple things, right? I mean, it's a cost savings issue, but I think clearly the real benefit of moving to e-commerce platform form is the S&OP process gets a lot slicker inventory management gets a lot better and you can centralize pricing rather than having distributed pricing around the world. So, yes, it's a bit of cost savings, but the real benefit is operational over time and it's not a kind of go-to-market platform and we expect to continue to sell through distribution.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone. Rich, maybe you can give us a little more color into your confidence level that margin can turn more positive in DP. Do you need your productivity projects in ESG and VSG to complete before you get the margin turn? And then the business obviously is steel heavy. So, with steel rolling a bit here, does it give you more confidence in the turn into just a lag as some of the businesses backlog driven?\nRichard Tobin: We were negative price cost for 2021 because of the catch up on the raw material versus price because the cycle time in terms of the inventory turns is just more difficult. Look putting the labor issues aside. So, on that alone, we've priced for raw materials inbound through the year, which we believe rolls positive in Q2 based on our forecast for production performance. And what that does, all things being equal is go back to historical operating margins that you would see from ESG and VSG back in the 2019 pre-COVID period as kind of expectation number one. The investments we're making are longer term investments that should be accretive to that '19 kind of benchmark, but we will get that over time. So, we may see some of that in '21 or in '22, but that's going to take some period of time. We're re-outfitting both of the main plants for those businesses.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Got it. And then, I'm going to ask you the old bookings question in the sense that bookings did not slow as you thought. I think we all understand that bookings will slow, but do you see an environment at least right now where the high level of bookings you're seeing is relatively sustainable? And how do we think about whether there is conservatism in your new '22 organic guide versus the backlog that's up obviously over 80%?\nRichard Tobin: Nothing like going first, I bet that -- I bet our revenue guide is not conservative when we're all said and done here, but I'll take your question anyway. Look bookings are going to slow. I mean, we've got businesses that are relatively short cycle that are bit booking into Q3. I mean, it's just inexplicable to me that there's any even need for our customers to go be beyond there at this point, right. I think we're going to get hit and it better happen, because if it doesn't happen, that means that supply chain issues are not resolving ourselves in '22 and we expect that to get progressively better. So, strangely, it's going to be a good thing if bookings decline in '22, relative to the rate that we saw in '21.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful. Thanks, Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll going now to Mircea Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.\nMircea Dobre: Yes. Thank you. Just sort of sticking with this theme on supply chain, I'm curious as to what you're seeing as far as your own components and your own purchases in terms of availability. I would imagine that, EP is probably the area where you're seeing the biggest challenge, but I'm kind of curious, one how that's changing into some of the other segments that might be experiencing this as well.\nRichard Tobin: I don't think that there's any segment that's immune to it. It's just -- if you step back and you think about the nature of the product, anything that's capital goods like has got a lot of raw material exposure, and it's got a lot of complexity because just the size and the dimension of the product, as opposed to something like a connector that's made out of injection multi-plastic at the end of the day, that's more of a capacity constraint and maybe some logistics. So, the locus of the issue on supply chain is very much within engineered products, but it's not to say end-to-end refrigeration because that is more -- refrigeration in terms of its business model is more applicable to what goes on in engineered products than anything else. So, it's not as bad as it was. And it's getting better. We would've liked to see it get better in terms of logistics cost to come down. And we're seeing some of that, but we'd like to see that curve get better. We are -- if you look at our working capital number, we have built a bunch of inventory and the reason we built -- partially, the reason we built all that inventory is to get around the intermittent curtailments of production, which really cost us a lot of money. So, our goal here is, we're assuming that production curtailments are going to come down a lot versus 2021 and 2022, and then logistics and supply chain will gradually get better through the year. Those are the underlying assumptions.\nMircea Dobre: Okay. But it sounds like you're seeing some of this already. It's not just aspirational hoping for it. Some of this is getting a little bit better.\nRichard Tobin: No, I mean, we can look at the futures on raw materials and steel and bar and everything else. Those are -- we can buy those inputs at lower prices than we have them in inventory right now.\nMircea Dobre: And related to that, my final question here, how do you think about pricing beyond 2022, because obviously, you have raised prices because of raw material inflation? Does that imply that you're going to have to give pricing back in '23 or not?\nRichard Tobin: That's a good question. And our expectation is we did not re-price our backlog, as it was built to the detriment of our margins, nor will we re-price our backlog the other way as input costs come down.\nMircea Dobre: All right, thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Welcome.\nOperator: We'll go now to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to circle back to the sort of incremental margins you have that 30% or placeholder for the year. From a firm wide standpoint, sounds like understandably that starts out year at the lower end and then builds, but maybe looking at it from a segment standpoints, should we assume that the incremental margins by division sort of tally up reasonably closely with the differing organic growth profile this year?\nRichard Tobin: Let me answer it, the best I can. I think the businesses that had detrimental margins in as are between in '21 are where we expect proportionally the biggest recovery in '22. We -- so and I think if you go back and look at the granularity, the comments that I mean that long winded explanation, I gave it the beginning, so and then we don't expect for margins to comedown in some of our higher performing businesses. So, the incremental margins there will be at book margin. We don't give out growth rate by business and/or segments, so you're going to have to make some assumptions there, but we give you backlog and everything else and we give you the full-year. So, I think it's safe to say, we expect robust incremental margins where we suffered in the claim one and we expect book conversion on revenue growth in the businesses that did well in '21.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you.\nBrad Cerepak: The only thing I would add to that is that we got to be a little bit. Andrey and Jack could help with this. There's a little bit of effort around the acquisitions impact on conversion. So, when we give a range there, we think about that range, pre those impacts that we've disclosed in the script we had, which was $40 million for the year, depending on how you're doing your calculations that can impact conversion.\nRichard Tobin: Very good point.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you, Brad. And then maybe my second question, just when we were looking at sort of pricing you met, you talked about pricing beyond 2022, but maybe stick with 2023 for now. I suppose it was a two-and-a-half or three-point tailwind to revenue from wide last year, just wondered within that 8% organic sales growth midpoint guide for this year. How much of that roughly is price and a big sort of first-half, second-half difference on that price tailwind?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. We had a long discussion here, preparing for this call that question was going to come? And I think my answer to that is I'm not going there. You're asking me to predict mix into the future. I think that we have it here. At the end of the day, I just don't think it's meaningful in terms of putting a placeholder out there. The fact of the matter is we've got robust organic revenue growth, a part of that is price. But does it really make a difference if it's two and a quarter percent, or a percent and a half at this juncture? I would argue not and beyond '23, I know that Mig asked the question about pricing in the future. We're not prepared to have that discussion yet.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes, on the other hand too, our forecast does not assume that we need to get price in the back-half of the year. I mean, we we've been putting price in as you know, and as you track in the quarterly results that we put out, but we're not sitting here saying to hit this forecast, we need to have big price increases in the back-half. That's not in the forecast. And I think that, what that means is we'll be proactive on price when we need to.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Maybe tell us what was the price in maybe the fourth quarter there and apologies if I miss that.\nBrad Cerepak: Julian, I'm going to send you to the back office to go and deal with that. I mean, we're going to start carving this into pieces here.\nJulian Mitchell: Fair enough. Thank you.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So, Rich, maybe I know you guys don't typically give margins by segment; you talked about the climate and sustainability, technology, segment that's seeing significant margin progress this year. Historically you have had that kind of mid teen target out there for the retail part of your business. Just curious like any other color that you can kind of give us on how much progress if you think you'll make in 2022. And then also just unified brands, was that margin diluted to your business, or no that that came out, that's coming out this year too?\nRichard Tobin: That was margin dilutive to the consolidated business. It was accretive to -- would have been accretive to Q4 I believe. If it was still in, but -- \nBrad Cerepak: It's a small impact.\nRichard Tobin: Yes, small impact at the end of the day. Look, I'm -- yes, we expect to hit our margin target for the refrigeration business in 2022. That's embedded in the forecast. And we expect robust growth out of both SWEP and Belvac back in '22, both of which are accretive -- that all of that revenue is accretive to margin.\nJoe Ritchie: Now, that's great. So, maybe just following on, my follow-on question, just staying in this segment, I mean, the backlog that you're building in the segment is pretty incredible, right? You know, $2.3 billion, like -- I don't think anybody's got any forecasts that are anywhere close to that that type of revenue number in the out years. I'm just like trying to understand how to think about this segment on a multiyear basis from the top line perspective based on what you're building today?\nA \u2013 Brad Cerepak: Yes. Well, look, on the refrigeration business, conceivably, we're going to get to the point where we'll cap off the growth in traditional door case, and then put all of our muscle behind CO2. CO2 is the part that's inflecting right now, and we'll probably have more color on that once we get into the mid '22 of what we think that can do going forward. Belvac is clearly going to be a story of building the backlog. So, we can just watch that as we progress through the year, and I think we'll do as we go through the year, what we've done in the past and break Belvac backlog away from the segments, so you can see it. And then Swep, look, we've been doing very, very well in Europe on heat pump technology. We expect that technology to be brought to the U.S. And as part of that, that's why we're expanding capacity today in advance of that. So, to the extent that we're deploying the capital means that we expect that business to continue its growth trajectory over time.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you, Brad.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks.\nOperator: We will take our final question today from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nBrett Linzey: Good morning, all. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, just wanted to come back to the internal manufacturing inefficiencies that took place in '21. Obviously, just given the environment those, you know, expected, but can you isolate those headwinds versus the raw maths and logistic inflation that you saw? I would imagine there's some non-repeat there, just trying to get a sense as to what that number looks like?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, it's a meaningful number. It's a large driver of the margin impact on engineered products. And what was the RFP, and I can't remember the name after all of this, and anyway, so -- but sizing it, I mean, maybe we can get back to you, it's meaningful, right? And that's part and parcel to why we think that we can expand profits at an absolute basis in '22, as much as we can, because we took a lot of hits by curtailing production, which really is outside of the price cost dynamic. That's just absolute lost fixed cost absorption and it goes with it.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes. Well, it's meaningful on the top line and on the earnings line. And I think Andrey can walk through that with you.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, great. Well, just trying to square the 30% incremental with price cost positive with [indiscernible] it seems like maybe some pushing in the guide. Just back to the e-commerce, looking to double that, I missed the timeframe you said in which you'd like to double those sales. And just given the lower cost to serve, what kind of incremental margin should we be thinking about as you take that number up?\nBrad Cerepak: We are -- we did a billion in '21, where our goal is to do $2 billion in '22. And as I mentioned before, it's not really cost takeout, it's not the advantage here. The advantage is across the entire complex, meaning inventory management, the ability to do pricing centrally, the ability to do dynamic pricing, SKU management. So, you're just going to have to look at that as a portfolio move, and it's part and parcel to us, extracting synergy across the portfolio through those initiatives rather than trying to parse it by operating company by -- or segment.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. Best of luck.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich, and good morning everyone. Let's go to slide six. On the top is the Revenue Bridge. Our top line organic revenue increased by 11% in the quarter, with all segments, except Clean Energy & Fuel posting growth. FX was a 1% or 12 million headwind to the top line, M&A added $17 million net to the to the top line in the quarter, a product of $26 million from acquisitions partially offset by $9 million from the Unified Brands divestiture. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North American and Asia, and solid growth across Europe and the rest of the world. The U.S., our largest market posted 16% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions and industrial [wrenches] [Ph], vehicle aftermarket, biopharma, and polymer processing. All of Asia was up 15% organically, and growth in biopharma, industrial pumps, marketing, coding, and heat exchangers. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia, was up 17% organically in the quarter. Europe grew by 7% in the quarter on strong shipments and precision components, biopharma, industrial pumps, natural refrigerant systems, and heat exchangers for heat pumps, partially offset by order timing in sustainable beverage can making. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were up 22% organically in the quarter, reflecting continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. Bookings helped drive our consolidated backlog to $3.2 billion, up 15% sequentially, inclusive of backlogs from our recent acquisitions. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across four of the five segments. Let's go to the earning bridges on slide seven. On the top chart, adjusting segment EBIT was up $47 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved 60 basis points as improved volumes continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation and production stoppages. On the bottom of the chart, adjusted net earnings improved by $34 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher corporate expenses and higher taxes. Deal expenses primarily related to our clean energy acquisitions were 11 million in the quarter, representing approximately $0.06 of adjusted EPS headwind. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits and gains on the sale of businesses was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.1% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $10.3 million for the quarter, or $2.1 million higher than 2020, for approximately $0.01 year over year EPS impact. After-tax right-sizing and other costs were 22 million in the quarter reflective of our ongoing productivity and right-sizing initiatives, including non-cash asset charges of approximately $16 million. Now on slide eight. In 2021, we generated $944 million of free cash flow, a slight increase over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 12% of revenue for the year despite and over $300 million investment in working capital. As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customer's strong order rates, and we are carrying high inventory levels to ensure we can meet the current demand into next year. With that, I'm going to pass it back to Rich. Hi, Scott. Yes, I would just add I think we have a modest forecast of inventory drawdown. Depending on how the year progresses, there could be come incremental there. The only thing I would add to that is that we got to be a little bit. Andrey and Jack could help with this. There's a little bit of effort around the acquisitions impact on conversion. So, when we give a range there, we think about that range, pre those impacts that we've disclosed in the script we had, which was $40 million for the year, depending on how you're doing your calculations that can impact conversion. Yes, on the other hand too, our forecast does not assume that we need to get price in the back-half of the year.

I mean, we're going to start carving this into pieces here. Thanks. It's a small impact. Thanks. Yes. Well, it's meaningful on the top line and on the earnings line. And I think Andrey can walk through that with you. We are -- we did a billion in '21, where our goal is to do $2 billion in '22. And as I mentioned before, it's not really cost takeout, it's not the advantage here.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrey, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on page three. We are thankful for the extraordinary efforts of our Dover team members which enabled us to deliver strong operating results amidst challenging conditions during 2021. We are also grateful to our customers who trusted us with their business while adapting their supply chains and business models to this rapidly changing and demanding environment. The resilience and creativity of our teams and the durability of our customer relationships were the key elements of our success this year, and we are committed to build upon those pillars in 2022, and mobilized to deliver another strong year of performance. All right, let's go on to the quarterly and full-year results. We delivered strong and better than expected results in fourth quarter and the full-year, posting organic revenue growth of 11% and 15%, respectively. Our margin conversion for the year was strong, and we delivered segment margin increase of over 200 basis points for the year, driven by volume growth, productivity gains, and our center-led enterprise capabilities. We are satisfied with this accomplishment in the face of the well-chronicled input shortages, supply chain constraints, and COVID-driven quarantines and absenteeism that became increasingly challenging during the Omicron period of Q4. As we mentioned in the opening remarks, we battled through as best we could under the circumstances, but we cannot help but be very frustrated by the continuing guidance on mandates and deadlines. It seems, often, that we have learned very little in the past 24 months. We complimented our strong operational execution with value-creating organic and inorganic growth investments. We deployed $1.1 billion in nine highly strategic bolt-on acquisitions, and also completed the divestiture of our non-core food service equipment platform, on December 1. These investments advanced our deliberate strategy to expand into markets with secular growth opportunities. Recognizing the recent changes to our portfolio and to better reflect the nature of the markets and customers served by our businesses, as well as the contributions to revenue, growth, and profits, we have changed the name of our Fueling Solutions segment to Clean Energy and Fueling, and our Refrigeration and Food Equipment segment to Climate and Sustainability Technologies. Looking ahead to 2022, we enter the year with constructive optimism despite the ever-evolving operating environment and geopolitical clouds. We believe that growth conditions are still with us, but it is critical that policies are enacted or not enacted to continue this trajectory. A methodical monetary tightening is deemed necessary, and I agree that it is. I would urge caution on the pace of any policy decisions in the regulatory environment or taxation if one wants to preserve GDP expansion trajectory. As COVID and its effects subside, we desperately need policy pragmatism with a bias towards policy that foster economic growth. Demand conditions across the majority of the portfolio remain favorable as evidenced by our strong sustained bookings in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, with the book-to-bill each quarter above one, even with the aforementioned double-digit revenue growth. Our backlog, of $3.2 billion, is up 84% versus this time last year, which allows us to better plan our capacity, production, and inventory; a major benefit in today's constrained operating environment. While we expect these operational challenges in supply chain and labor availability to continue into early '22, we do not expect operating conditions -- we do expect operating conditions and price material spreads to improve as the year progresses. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver robust top line growth, margin expansion, and EPS accretion in 2022. We are therefore forecasting full-year revenue guidance of 7% to 9% organic growth, and adjusted EPS of $8.45 to $8.65 per share. I will skip slide four, which provides more a more detailed overview of the results, so let's go on to slide five. Engineered Products revenue was up 16% organically in the quarter as demand remained favorable across all businesses. Vehicle Services posted a strong top line quarter, and market indicators remain positive. Environmental Services Group revenue was up year-over-year; with both bookings and backlog remain robust moving into 2022. Industrial Automation demand remained high, posting its strongest bookings quarter of the year, while deliveries were negatively impacted by output challenges in America and Europe. Aerospace and Defense posted a solid year-over-year growth, with good momentum behind our recent Espy acquisition, the recovery of industrial winches continues with all end markets trending positive. Despite the heightened demand, margin performance in the segment remains negatively impacted by the combination of input cost inflation and input shortages, with notable impact from COVID-related absenteeism, particularly late in the quarter where we ran at over 20% rates, in some instances, at the height of Omicron. In the fourth quarter, Engineered Products was the only segment that had a negative price cost spread, largely driven by raw materials and logistics costs. This remains our most challenged segment in the current operating environment that we have line of sight to improve margin outlook as the price cost spread turns positive in 2022. Incremental margin conversion is expected to gain steam through the year as we cycle through inventory, and we begin shipping off a strong backlog that was priced in the second-half of 2021. Clean Energy & Fueling was down 4% organically in the quarter against a difficult comparable from 2020, when we saw the high watermark of EMV demand. Additionally, volume was constrained by our customers' construction, labor slowdown, and component shortages, as well as COVID absenteeism in Europe. Booking trends and backlog in the aboveground business remain constructive, based on early market feedback and trajectory we believe that we have a winning pro with the Anthem dispenser. Conversely, demand trends for belowground equipment have picked up in North America, and deliveries and vehicle wash continued their upward trend most notably in access terminal and controller business that we acquired a year ago. Our recent Clean Energy acquisitions had a minimal impact on our Q4 results. However, backlogs in these businesses are strong. Margins were down in the quarter, primarily due to the lower volumes, product mix, absenteeism-driven inefficiencies and loss fixed-cost absorption. Full-year results in this business were strong and better than we initially forecasted early in the year on robust growth, productivity and favorable mix. Sales in Imaging & Identification grew 3% organically. The core marketing and coding business was strong on comparable volume though a short of components on some -- and some order push outs reduced volumes in printers. Our serialization and brand management software business continues to grow ahead of expectations when we're working diligently to add additional resources here, as we integrate and scale the business. The digital textile business continues its gradual recovery, and was up against a low bar comparable quarter, but it is still not recovered to pre-COVID levels. Q4 margins in Imaging & ID improved by 40 basis points year-over-year, as mix and price more than offset cost inflation and input availability issues. Full-year results were strong. The segment delivered 8% organic growth and 170 basis points of margin expansion are good volumes and productivity initiatives. Pumps & Process Solutions posted another strong quarter at 30% organic growth. Revenue for our CPC business was up double digits. We completed a clean room expansion project for this business in December, and anticipation of another strong growth year in 2022. Industrial and biopharma pumps were up on broad based end customer demand across all geographies.  We are pleased with the performance of the flow meter business within Em-tec, which we acquired in 2020, its biopharma sales have doubled in 2021. Precision component was up as the business continues its recovering on improving demand in their broader industry exposure. Polymer Processing was up in the quarter due to strong demand for palletizers and gear pumps as well as strong order rates and recycling equipment and consumables particularly in the U.S. and China. Margins expanded by a robust 740 basis points in the quarter and 790 basis points in the year on strong volumes, fixed cost absorption, favorable product mix and pricing. Top line results in Climate & Sustainability Technologies continue to be robust posting 13% organic growth. SWEP our heat exchange of business capped off the year, posting all-time records and bookings revenue and margin and carries a strong backlog into 2022. The business was strong across all geographies and end markets with particularly favorable demand in the EMEA for heat pumps, driven by regulatory requirements. We have been adding additional capacity in several geographies to meet forecasted future demand. Belvac, our provider production solutions for beverage packaging posted a revenue decline in the fourth quarter on difficult comparable driven by project timing. As we know, this business was up significantly in 2021, part of a multi-year secular shift toward more environmentally friendly aluminum cans with demand far exceeding the current installed capacity. Demand in our food retail business remains robust with elevated bookings and backlog levels. Our systems business in the U.S. and Europe continued its robust growth in deliveries and orders for natural CO2 refrigeration systems. Demand for door cases remained elevated as well. However, we continue to face labor constraints and subcomponent supply shortages that delayed shipments which necessitated intermitted production curtailments negatively impacting margins. We've instituted a number of price increases, which we expect to positively contribute to margins and conversion into 2022. Margins were flat, largely flat as the quarter as excellent operating performances swept, offset refrigeration headwinds despite the smaller revenue base. This segment demonstrated good progress in 2021, 22% of growth after a very modest 3% decline in 2020 and 230 basis point margin expansion despite multiple operational challenges as the year presented. With a strong backlog, we expect a continued robust progress in 2022. And I'll pass it on to Brad. Okay, thanks, Brad. I'm on slide nine, which shows our progress in 2021 against the capital allocation priorities we outlined at our Investor Day in 2019. We have a strong collection of businesses, and our first priority is ensuring we can continue to win in the market through organic investments, supporting growth capacity, digitization, innovation, and productivity. We deployed over $170 million capital expenditure in 2021 towards growth and productivity enhancements, as well as maintenance of our asset base. Notably, we invested over $14 million in digital products and digital and e-commerce, which allow us to reach our goal of over 1 billion in e-commerce revenue last year with no touch by customer service. This represents over 10 times the volume we processed in 2018. And our 2020 goal is to double our 2021 volume. Our next priority is inorganic growth. Last year, we deployed 1.1 billion into nine highly synergistic bolt-on acquisitions including two larger deals Acme, and RegO, which we closed in December. All these acquisitions enhance our portfolio by increasing our exposure to markets with structural demand, growth, outlook. Our pipeline, and acquisition capacity remains strong and we expect to remain active on this front in 2022. Our third priority is to return capital to our shareholders that we again raised our dividend in 2021 as we have done for the past 66 years Let's move to Slide 10, we provide more color and some of our organic investments. So, I won't go into the specifics any of these projects individually, but you'll see that our investments are substantial in size and represent a broad variety of productivity improvement and digitization initiatives as well as investments and capacity expansion, and new product development projects. These investments provide compelling financial returns and our proactive capacity expansions have allowed us to win share in the tight supply market. Slide 11 includes our current view of demand outlook and operational environment for 2022 by summit segment and how margin drivers are expected to trend over time and provides context of how we're thinking about our full-year guidance, which I'll get to shortly. We expect top line and engineered products to remain robust based on solid backlog and sustain high bookings across the business. All market indicators and vehicle aftermarket continue to remain positive and miles driven having fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels and used cars prices remaining elevated. Orders for rough use trucks and software solutions are robust, with new order rates pushing well into the second-half of '22, momentum and industrial automation and industrial witches should continue on the back of the solid bookings quarter of all end markets contributing to growth aerospace and defense is expecting growth on positive order trends largely driven by Europe. We expect headwinds from negative cost to continue in the first-half of the year getting sequentially better as the year progressed. We expect this segment to be the only one with negative price cost spread in the first quarter. Input availability, mostly labor absenteeism, freeze from recent Omicron surge is expected to negatively impact production efficiency in the first quarter, but should subside for the balance of the year. All in we expect margins for the segment in the first-half of the year to largely mirror the second-half of '21, then to improve meaningfully for the full-year driven by volume leverage and pricing. We expect clean energy and fueling to post low single-digit organic growth for the full-year on solid growth and below ground vehicle wash and software solutions. Demand outlook and bookings of our recently acquired clean energy businesses are very robust and they are off to a good start. As you know, we don't adjust acquisition related amortization out of our adjusted segment earnings margins due to sizable acquisition related amortization charges from our recent deals in the segment, the operating margin will be compressed in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding about 40 million of incremental deal-related amortization expenses and '22, we expect full-year margin conversion to be in line with broader portfolio. Demand conditions in imaging and identification are expected to continue the positive trajectory into 2022. Our core marketing and coding business expect to maintain its steady GDP like growth rate, serialization and brand protection software should contribute positively to robust -- on robust bookings and backlog. Digital textile printing is recovering and is expect to take another year or two to reach pre-pandemic levels as apparel producers take a cautious stance with new capital outlays. We expect margin in the segment to continue to improve in 2022. Pumps and process solutions should see another year of solid performance. Demand for biopharma applications remains robust driven by demand for COVID vaccines, as well as growth in cell and gene therapies and expansion of MRNA technology to other applications. We are completing the second phase of our cleanroom expansions and automation to ensure we can keep up with demand and we have broken ground on the construction of a new facility. Additionally, our connector business is experiencing robust growth in new thermal applications such as data center and supercomputing and EV charging. Trading conditions and industrial pumps are strong driven by robust and customer demand, plastics and polymers equipment business carries a solid backlog into 2022 with good market conditions and visibility especially in China, the U.S. and recycling solutions. Precision components continued its upward trajectory aided by OEM new builds and increasing activities at refineries and petrochemical plants. We expect margin performance to remain robust for the segment on volume growth, operational execution and positive price cost dynamics and climate and sustainability technologies we expect to post high single digit organic growth this year driven by its large backlog, and sustained elevated order rates, new orders and core food retail business have been healthy across product segments and the tailwinds from our leadership position and natural refrigerants are driving outsized growth of our CO2 systems business. As Omicron induced labor shortages abate in the first quarter, we expect volumes of door cases to recover with backlog stretching well into the second-half of the year. Our heat exchanger businesses positioned well on strong order rates across all geographies. Our Belvac packaging business continues to work through its record backlog. They are booked for 2022 and are taking orders for 2023. We expect to have our new R&D center and full can line completed in the first-half of the year. We expect margins to improve significantly in 2022. As improved volume leverage positive, price cost dynamics, productivity gains from our automation initiatives, and positive product and business mix should more than offset any lingering operational challenges related to component and labor shortages in the first quarter. All right, so before wrapping up and move into Q&A, let's try to square the circle here and sum up all the moving parts from our 2021 position to our full-year guidance. At the opening of this call, I said our results were better than expected. That was not a reference to external consensus estimates, but a comment about our operating margin performance versus our internal forecasts. Without the significant Omicron production and productivity losses which were not in our base forecast, we would have shipped more product in Q4 resulting in higher sales and cash flow, but lower consolidated margin on product mix. As a result of this, while we do get the benefit of carrying higher backlogs into 2022, we have not cleared as much higher cost inventory and have not realized all the benefits of past pricing actions embedded in that backlog. This will result in the calendar re-visitation of absolute earnings and earnings growth and especially segment operating margin being more back end loaded. And a typical year as a result of this date delayed backlog for us. A few implications of this dynamic, number one we approved an operating margin expectations for Q1 and encourage those modeling quarterly forecasts to exercise the same level of prudence. Number two, it is a good sign of backlogs gradually deplete during the year as it will be driven by higher production performance as labor availability and supply chains improve. Lastly, if both these dynamics play out as forecasted, we can expect inventory levels to drop supporting increased operating cash flow in 2022. So let's move to slide 13, which hopefully removes the quarterly noise and gives us some view of post pandemic full-year performance. Here we provide a bridge between our adjusted EPS in 2021 and 2022. We expect to generate double-digit EPS growth again this year driven by solid organic top line growth, much of which is currently in backlog as well as healthy full-year margin conversion and the positive impact from acquisition close in 2021. And so let's wrap up to Slide 14 to put our results and guide into the longer-term perspective. Our strategy has driven significant value creation for our shareholders over the last several years, as evidenced by the total shareholder return driven by underappreciated top line growth, cumulative margin expansion of 440 basis points, healthy cash flow generation and capital redeployment. We believe that our playbook offers us significant runway to continue delivering attractive cycle requirements over the coming years. And with that let us move to the Q&A. Andrey? Hi, Scott. Well, I guess -- yes, I guess, now that we've disposed with the federal mandate, hopefully, I mean that was not helpful at all, it is getting better. I think that the quarantine period being halved has helped. So, it's not as bad as the peak, which was probably in December, but it is lingering somewhat into January, but it's not as bad. Yes, I mean I -- look, we expected to ship that. Now, whether we would have been caught up in receivables, who is to say? But my view is we would have expected to maybe have a slight increase in inventory based on the revenue. But our expectation for 2022, if we get this right, which we expect we will, is that we're going to give back that build net of revenue increase for the year. So, I expect to do better in working capital in 2022 than we did in '21. Thanks. Good morning. Yes, it's in our forecast for 2022. Look, at the end of the day is we can't call it Food Equipment anymore since we disposed of the food equipment business. So, by and large, we had to rename it. The fact of the matter is, and I don't want to get cheeky about ESG-driven nomenclature here, is that the fastest growing portions of that segment are in sustainability technologies, it's SWEP, and our CO2 systems, and Belvac, which are all driven, we would argue, by a shift to meet ESG compliance, whether that's regulatory-driven or driven by other matters. So, I get it, it looks a little bit cheeky on our part, but it is what's growing within the portfolio. Yes. I think that that first quarter will look more or less like Q4. I think that it'll move around a little bit, segment by segment, and I would imagine a little bit better than Q4. But, at the end of the day, some of the headwinds we had in Q4 we're going to carry into Q1, a lot of that driven by, as Scott asked, the lingering effects of absenteeism, which we're still dealing with a little bit right now. Logistics costs haven't come down a lot. But more importantly, because of our inability to flush backlog in Q4, what we would have expected to be catching up on price cost dynamic is a bit delayed. But that's all -- that's all incorporate into our -- the full-year number. Yes, on an absolute basis. All right, thanks. Good morning. There are. But the beauty of those two businesses is the fact that they're so concentrated in terms of the supply base. So, there's not a lot of M&A you can really do. But if you look where we've been spending organic capital, we've actually been deploying proportionately quite a bit to SWEP and Belvac on organic capacity expansion. So, I'm not ruling M&A out because there are some interesting adjacencies around it, but what we've been doing is just investing behind growth. And I think that SWEP will be finishing, in 2022, an expansion in all four of the geographies they participate in, for example. And I think that we've put in 15 years worth of CapEx into Belvac over the last 18 months or so. So, it's more of organic play, I think. Yes, well, the growth rates are going to come down. I mean let's call a spade a spade here. I mean, everything get clocked in for, what, 30% for the year, something like that. So, they're going to come down over time. And we don't have that kind of growth rate for that business embedded into our forecast for 2022. We also do not embed in our forecast any margin dilution because of COVID demand roll-off, because we think that the fundamental demand for the -- for those products is solid. And I would have hoped that [Danaher] [Ph] could have done a better job talking about it since they are a market participant in the same space. We believe that the growth rate will come down as COVID demand begins to roll off. We don't envision it going negative in '22, nor do we think that margins are going to be negatively impacted. The answer to the first question is yes, so the entire company in Q2. And yes again in terms of margin enhancement, especially in Engineered Products. Thanks. Hey, Andrew. I hope so since we're greenfielding a new facility for it right now, as we speak. Yes, look, I mean we were not able to keep up with customer demand in '21. I think that we did better than some of our competitors, meaning, I think, that we captured growth opportunities. But even with that capture, I think that we were, at certain points of the year disappointing our customers with our ability to serve. So, that was what drove the decision about expanding capacity. And I think, we greenfield the facility up in Minneapolis in 2019, it's sold out. So, that's why we're expanding there. And in our disposable pump business in Germany, we are bringing assembly operations with expansion to clean room in the United States for that particular product. So, our preferred path is inorganic investment to dry growth, because that's where our returns are the highest, but having, and as we've discussed many times, look, there's no secret that these are really interesting pieces of the market and they attract very high pricing. So, we're going to have to be selective on the M&A side. I think we have some interesting things that we're looking at for sure, but I think that we can do this simultaneously inorganic and organic. Well, let me answer the second one -- second question first, because it's easier. No, I don't think -there's a -- our plan here is not to go around distribution. Our plan here to put in e-commerce platforms is a couple things, right? I mean, it's a cost savings issue, but I think clearly the real benefit of moving to e-commerce platform form is the S&OP process gets a lot slicker inventory management gets a lot better and you can centralize pricing rather than having distributed pricing around the world. So, yes, it's a bit of cost savings, but the real benefit is operational over time and it's not a kind of go-to-market platform and we expect to continue to sell through distribution. We were negative price cost for 2021 because of the catch up on the raw material versus price because the cycle time in terms of the inventory turns is just more difficult. Look putting the labor issues aside. So, on that alone, we've priced for raw materials inbound through the year, which we believe rolls positive in Q2 based on our forecast for production performance. And what that does, all things being equal is go back to historical operating margins that you would see from ESG and VSG back in the 2019 pre-COVID period as kind of expectation number one. The investments we're making are longer term investments that should be accretive to that '19 kind of benchmark, but we will get that over time. So, we may see some of that in '21 or in '22, but that's going to take some period of time. We're re-outfitting both of the main plants for those businesses. Nothing like going first, I bet that -- I bet our revenue guide is not conservative when we're all said and done here, but I'll take your question anyway. Look bookings are going to slow. I mean, we've got businesses that are relatively short cycle that are bit booking into Q3. I mean, it's just inexplicable to me that there's any even need for our customers to go be beyond there at this point, right. I think we're going to get hit and it better happen, because if it doesn't happen, that means that supply chain issues are not resolving ourselves in '22 and we expect that to get progressively better. So, strangely, it's going to be a good thing if bookings decline in '22, relative to the rate that we saw in '21. Thanks. I don't think that there's any segment that's immune to it. It's just -- if you step back and you think about the nature of the product, anything that's capital goods like has got a lot of raw material exposure, and it's got a lot of complexity because just the size and the dimension of the product, as opposed to something like a connector that's made out of injection multi-plastic at the end of the day, that's more of a capacity constraint and maybe some logistics. So, the locus of the issue on supply chain is very much within engineered products, but it's not to say end-to-end refrigeration because that is more -- refrigeration in terms of its business model is more applicable to what goes on in engineered products than anything else. So, it's not as bad as it was. And it's getting better. We would've liked to see it get better in terms of logistics cost to come down. And we're seeing some of that, but we'd like to see that curve get better. We are -- if you look at our working capital number, we have built a bunch of inventory and the reason we built -- partially, the reason we built all that inventory is to get around the intermittent curtailments of production, which really cost us a lot of money. So, our goal here is, we're assuming that production curtailments are going to come down a lot versus 2021 and 2022, and then logistics and supply chain will gradually get better through the year. Those are the underlying assumptions. No, I mean, we can look at the futures on raw materials and steel and bar and everything else. Those are -- we can buy those inputs at lower prices than we have them in inventory right now. That's a good question. And our expectation is we did not re-price our backlog, as it was built to the detriment of our margins, nor will we re-price our backlog the other way as input costs come down. Welcome. Let me answer it, the best I can. I think the businesses that had detrimental margins in as are between in '21 are where we expect proportionally the biggest recovery in '22. We -- so and I think if you go back and look at the granularity, the comments that I mean that long winded explanation, I gave it the beginning, so and then we don't expect for margins to comedown in some of our higher performing businesses. So, the incremental margins there will be at book margin. We don't give out growth rate by business and/or segments, so you're going to have to make some assumptions there, but we give you backlog and everything else and we give you the full-year. So, I think it's safe to say, we expect robust incremental margins where we suffered in the claim one and we expect book conversion on revenue growth in the businesses that did well in '21. Very good point. Yes. We had a long discussion here, preparing for this call that question was going to come? And I think my answer to that is I'm not going there. You're asking me to predict mix into the future. I think that we have it here. At the end of the day, I just don't think it's meaningful in terms of putting a placeholder out there. The fact of the matter is we've got robust organic revenue growth, a part of that is price. But does it really make a difference if it's two and a quarter percent, or a percent and a half at this juncture? I would argue not and beyond '23, I know that Mig asked the question about pricing in the future. We're not prepared to have that discussion yet. Hi, Joe. That was margin dilutive to the consolidated business. It was accretive to -- would have been accretive to Q4 I believe. If it was still in, but -- Yes, small impact at the end of the day. Look, I'm -- yes, we expect to hit our margin target for the refrigeration business in 2022. That's embedded in the forecast. And we expect robust growth out of both SWEP and Belvac back in '22, both of which are accretive -- that all of that revenue is accretive to margin. Good morning. Yes, it's a meaningful number. It's a large driver of the margin impact on engineered products. And what was the RFP, and I can't remember the name after all of this, and anyway, so -- but sizing it, I mean, maybe we can get back to you, it's meaningful, right? And that's part and parcel to why we think that we can expand profits at an absolute basis in '22, as much as we can, because we took a lot of hits by curtailing production, which really is outside of the price cost dynamic. That's just absolute lost fixed cost absorption and it goes with it. Thanks."

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s go to page three. Dover Corporation and its operating companies had a solid quarter. The performance stats indicate that our product strategies, coupled with our ongoing productivity initiatives continued to deliver topline growth, margin accretion, and attractive cash flow to our investors. Our revenue and bookings growth continued to outpace our pre-pandemic levels and we exited the quarter with a record high and sequentially increased backlog while posting topline growth of 15% over the comparable period. Demand strength was broad-based as each segment posted year-over-year growth in bookings and a book-to-bill above 1. Revenue growth, product -- positive product mix, and ongoing productivity initiatives drove comparable operating margins up, resulting in a 31% increase in U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share. Our free cash flow performance was strong with an 18% year-over-year increase, despite significant investments we\u2019ve made in inventory as we begin to reap the benefits of our investments in the centralization of financial processing activities. We continue to enhance and improve our portfolio with several acquisitions completed in the last three months and the divestiture of our commercial foodservice business announced last week. Our organic investments and capacity expansions and productivity projects are on track, providing us the building blocks for the future topline growth and margin expansion. As one of the first multi-industrials to report each quarter and because of our wide end market exposures, we have the pleasure to be the operating environment bellwether, so let\u2019s get on the front foot here by providing some color on inflationary inputs, labor, and supply chain challenges, so that we have time to discuss the constructive demand environment for 2022 in the Q&A. Let me start by saying that we\u2019re particularly concerned that there have been no discernible policy changes, particularly in the U.S. to deal with these headwinds, and in fact many proposed policies run the risk of extending their duration. We take no satisfaction in the fact that we\u2019ve been telegraphing these issues all year and incorporating to the -- incorporating them into our forecast of the businesses that bear the brunt of these challenges, which I will expand upon during the segment review. We have taken the appropriate actions to offset these headwinds moving into 2022 and we are comforted by the fact that we have been given the opportunity to demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strength of the breadth of our product and geographic market exposures that are ultimately reflected in these quarterly results. To be clear, we are very constructive about 2022 demand for our products and services and remain optimistic that there will be a recognition that protecting the duration of the current strong economic demand environment needs proactive policy decisions. We are raising our full year EPS guidance as a result of our strong year-to-date performance. Our updated forecast do not incorporate any material improvement nor deterioration of the challenging operating environment in the fourth quarter. Our priorities remain the same supporting our customers with products and services for the long-term, and the health and welfare of our employees. I will skip to slide four, which provides a more detailed review of our results for the third quarter. So let\u2019s move to slide five. Engineered Products revenue was up 14% organically with a significant portion of the growth from pricing actions. Vehicle Services posted a strong topline quarter and market indicators remained positive, with vehicle miles driven recovering and average vehicle age continuing to increase. Industrial Automation demand was up double digits with strong activity in Americas and China. Environmental Services Group revenue was up year-over-year and its backlog remained strong moving into 2022. Aerospace and Defense posted a decline year-over-year, largely a result to changes in programmed shipment timing. The margin performance in the quarter was unfortunately what we expected to occur as we progressed through the year. Our Engineered Products segment, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, has the largest exposure to raw materials, assembly labor as a percentage of cost of goods, and supply chain complexity. As such, it is more than just a price cost issue where even an equilibrium drives negative margin performance. It is exasperated by numerous component supply issues that necessitated us to intermittently curtail production to stabilize the manufacturing system in the quarter. Our management team is doing exactly what we would expect of them to protect profitability in the short-term, while managing the relationships with our strategically important customers. I have absolute confidence that the profit margin in the segment will bounce back as we move into 2022 as a result of actions already taken in price and as raw materials and supply chain constraints moderate as can be seen in the raw materials futures and stabilizing container shipping rates. Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on solid demand in North America for above-ground and below-ground retail fueling. We believe our production schedule and delivery times are driving share gains particularly in the above-ground category. Vehicle wash posted another strong quarter with some encouraging customer conversion and cross-selling benefits from our recent ICS acquisition. Activity in China remains subdued, driven by the lasting impacts of COVID and near-term uncertainty related to energy supply. Fuel Transport Components were negative for the quarter, but we believe that this is [expected to] (ph) improve moving forward. Margins in the segment declined 150 basis points in the quarter, as productivity headwinds from supply chain constraints and subcomponents and negative mix more than offset higher volumes and pricing. We have taken the appropriate actions on pricing to counter these headwinds going forward. Sales in Imaging & Identification grew 7% organically. The core Marking and coding business grew well on good demand for printers and consumables. Serialization Software also grew ahead of expectations and we are working to add additional resources here as we integrate the recently acquired Blue Bite brand management software into our solutions. The Digital Textile Printing business was up significantly year-over-year against a low bar comparable quarter and is continuing its gradual recovery. Margins in Imaging & ID improved by 250 basis points as volume leverage, pricing, and productivity initiatives more than offset input cost inflation. Pumps & Process Solutions posted another solid quarter at 25% organic growth. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong. We continued to expand clean room capacity for our biopharma connectors and single-use pumps in the period, and we are encouraged by specification wins in Em-tec Biopharma flow meters, which we acquired last year. Industrial Pumps were up based on broad-based end customer demand with particular strength in China. Precision Components was up year-over-year as compression OEM and aftermarket businesses continued their recovery. Polymer Processing was down in the quarter due to a combination of shipment timing and a very strong third quarter from the prior year, though new order rates remained strong and outlook is positive moving into 2022. Margins in the quarter expanded by a robust 630 basis points on strong volume, fixed cost absorption, favorable product mix, and pricing. Topline results in Refrigeration & Food Equipment remained strong, posting 16% organic growth. Revenue in beverage can-making equipment doubled in the quarter. The business is booked into late 2022 and is taking orders for 2023. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in all geographies, led by residential heating and industrial end markets and a recovery in the global commercial HVAC demand. Order intakes continue to exceed our ability to ship, so we are adding additional capacity in two geographies to ensure that we can meet forecasted demand in 2022. Demand in Food Retail remains robust with elevated bookings and backlogs across all our product lines. However, much like our Engineered Products business, we have a difficult time with labor constraints, and in particular, subcomponent supply, which has necessitated significant operational cost in logistics, intermediate production curtailments, and in one case, deferment of a delivery into 2022. Again, management is straddling cost recovery actions and meeting demands of our customers, but it clearly comes with a cost. Margins were largely flat in the quarter as excellent operating performance and swept and Belvac offset refrigeration headwinds despite their smaller revenue base. I will pass it to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s go to slide six. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our topline organic revenue increased by 13% in the quarter, with all five segments posting growth, with strong demand in our Engineered Products, Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited the topline by about 1% or $21 million. Acquisitions added $18 million of revenue in the quarter. There was no year-over-year impact from dispositions. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America and Europe, our two largest regions and modest growth across Asia and the rest of the world. The U.S., our largest market, posted 16% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions and retail, industrial automation, biopharma and can making. Europe grew by 16% in the quarter on strong shipments in marking, coding, biopharma and industrial pumps, can making and heat exchangers. All of Asia was up 5% organically on growth of biopharma and industrial pumps and heat exchangers, partially offset by year-over-year declines in polymer processing, below-ground retail fueling and fuel transport. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia was up 8% organically in the quarter. Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 25% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all five segments. Let\u2019s go to the earnings bridges on slide seven. On the top of the chart, the adjusted segment EBIT was up $64 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved 80 basis points, as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset cost inflation and production stoppages. Going to the bottom chart, adjusted net earnings improved by $57 million, as higher segment EBIT and lower corporate expenses more than offset higher taxes. Deal expense in the quarter were $3 million. The effective tax rate for the third quarter excluding tax discrete benefits was approximately 21.8%, compared to 21.5% in the prior year. And our effective tax rate estimate pre-discreet for Q4 and the full year remains unchanged at 21% to 22%. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million for the quarter or $4 million higher than in 2020 or approximately $0.03 of year-over-year EPS impact. Rightsizing and other costs were a $2 million reduction to adjusted earnings in the quarter, as a one-time recovery related to a cancellation settlement more than offset our ongoing productivity and rightsizing initiatives. Now on slide eight. We\u2019re pleased with the cash performance thus far this year, with cash -- with free cash flow of $667 million, a $104 million increase over last year, free cash flow conversion stands at 11% of revenue year-to-date, despite a nearly $250 million investment in working capital. As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers strong order rates and we are carrying high inventory levels to ensure we can meet current demand for the rest of the year and into next year. Let me turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Brad. I am on slide nine, which is a familiar format we used during the Investor Day in 2019 to describe our inorganic growth priorities. I am pleased to report that our activity since then has aligned well with those priorities and we remain busy adding logical logistic bolt-ons that will support the long-term growth of our core businesses. As you can see that we are investing in the highest priority platforms with an emphasis on high growth, high gross margin products and solutions. We remain disciplined in our approach to acquisitions and despite the challenging asset prices in today\u2019s environment, we have acquired seven bolt-on acquisitions year-to-date that meet our investment return criteria, including two in the third quarter and one that closed last week. The most recent deals highlighted in green were CDS, an industrial 3D visualization software, which we expect to grow in third-party revenues and also adopt across the Dover portfolio in our journey towards digitizing the front-end of our businesses, lowering our transaction costs. SP, which complements our Aerospace and Defense business, a software-driven signal intelligence solutions and LIQAL, which is an emerging leader in LNG and hydrogen dispensing solutions. Each transaction is modest addition to our aggregate portfolio, but we are very excited about scaling up these innovative and strategic technologies over time, and the positive impact to EPS as these investments mature. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions and have a solid M&A pipeline that aligns well with our portfolio priorities. We also took advantage of recent market activity in the Food Equipment sector to sell Unified Brands, a professional cooking equipment business for commercial foodservice operators. The deal was announced in early October and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Unified Brands represents less than 2% of our overall revenue and its sale will have a negligible impact on our 2021 adjusted EPS. I would like to thank the management and employees of Unified Brands for the many years of service in the Dover family. As we look to the end of the year, demand outlook remains favorable across the majority of the portfolio, backlogs and bookings remain robust and we expect to post strong organic growth in Q4. Overall, we remain on track to deliver strong returns this year through a combination of robust growth in revenue, operating profit and cash flow, coupled with disciplined capital allocation. We also look forward to closing out this year and laying the foundation for what we believe to be a positive demand environment in 2022. We have clarity about the nature of the inflationary input and supply disruption costs that we incurred in Q3 and expect to queue in Q4 due to the challenging operating environment and we have conviction that we can turn them into profitability tailwinds as conditions improve and the calendar progresses from here. Before wrapping up, I would like to thank Dover for all their preservers and accomplishments executing in today\u2019s environment. And with that, let\u2019s turn it to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey. Hi. Great color here. Hey. First, just on inflation, Rich, it sounds like supply disruptions and kind of the -- what it did in your factories was much more of a challenge than getting price to overcome cost. Can you just address that a little bit more and were you relatively price cost-neutral in the quarter?\nRichard Tobin: We were not price cost neutral in the quarter in the segments where you can see the dilution at the operating margin. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a two-fold story. Where we\u2019re getting the most price is where we\u2019re getting impacted the most, because not only you are driving with price increases, driving the topline, even in equilibrium that\u2019s dilutive to operating margins. So, when you\u2019re in a negative position, you get kind of a 300-point dilution. So the bad news is we\u2019re not in equilibrium in Q3. From here, we\u2019d begin to squeeze that down in Q4 and if conditions don\u2019t deteriorate go positive moving into 2022.\nJeff Sprague: And then unrelated but the backlogs and what you\u2019re kind of pointing to here in Q4, it looks like at the midpoint, your Q4 revenue has guided down about 9% sequentially, which would be more than normal, and certainly seems high, especially relative to the backlog. So, could you just address that and give us a little more color on how you might be able to uncork these backlogs and the visibility, and maybe what a normal backlog situation would look like?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. I think that we\u2019re hopeful that we can get out what we\u2019re projecting in our guidance. Clearly, not in the -- not only in the revenue but the EPS, we\u2019re driving towards the top end here. But it\u2019s a normal Q4 despite and Brad went over cash flow. We will run for cash somewhat at the end of the year. We have certain businesses that are seasonal that don\u2019t deliver much in December and then we lose production days just because of Thanksgiving and Christmas. So, we\u2019re talking about double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter into Q4, and we\u2019re going to endeavor to get it out, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hey. Just to clarify on that last one, you said price cost neutral, so pricing was, I think, 3.5% or something like that, so roughly $60 million of kind of favorability. Do you mean on kind of an absolute basis that you had more cost inflation than that in the quarter?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. I mean there\u2019s three buckets, right? There is raw materials, there\u2019s logistics and supply chain, and then there\u2019s business interruption costs that we incurred during the quarter. The vast majority of the negative impact is reflected in the segments that you can see, and a conservative view of what that cost was in the quarter is somewhere in the order of $25 million to $30 million in EBIT lost. That compresses in Q4 on a lower revenue line.\nSteve Tusa: Right. That\u2019s from the disruption you said, like, kind of like disruption\u2026\nRichard Tobin: That\u2019s all three.\nBrad Cerepak: That\u2019s all it.\nRichard Tobin: That\u2019s all three.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. So then why wouldn\u2019t that be -- so then why wouldn\u2019t it be positive price cost, if that\u2019s the case?\nRichard Tobin: Because a lot of it is still in inventory, so you\u2019ve got that role based on -- you\u2019ve got the raw materials inventory and you\u2019ve got the orders in backlog and depending on when you took the orders and when they cycle through. So\u2026\nSteve Tusa: Right.\nRichard Tobin: \u2026 two most effective businesses that we have, the price cost in total, including all three categories narrows from the number that I just gave you, but it does not get positive. Without getting granular here, it may get positive on raw materials, but not pick up logistics on the logistics side. From a total portfolio point of view, I think, that we are in neutrality in Q4.\nBrad Cerepak: Right.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then are these supply constraints, like, is there anything that really stands out, are there like onesies and twosies of components or is there something that really stands out, and ultimately could you give any visibility on kind of, I guess, the million-dollar question is timing of resolution on these things. I mean, are we going to be going into the second quarter of next year still kind of dealing with this stuff in your view?\nRichard Tobin: Well, look, I mean, as Brad mentioned, we\u2019re carrying the inventory, so we won\u2019t liquidate all of that in Q4. So to a certain extent, we are over ordering on the component side just because it\u2019s a little bit of a whackable. It was hydraulics back in Q2 and to a certain extent at the beginning of Q3. That\u2019s lightening up and now its electronic components. So, it\u2019s a myriad of stuff, but unfortunately, all it takes is one missing piece here. It seems like it\u2019s getting -- it\u2019s not getting worse. I guess is what I am saying. I am a bit concerned about policy decisions making it worse. I don\u2019t have a lot of faith in announcements about port activity having a demonstrable impact in the short run, quite frankly. But I think that because of the fact that we\u2019ve been over ordering to a certain extent ourselves, I think it should modulate. But I am not ready to prognosticate about how much better it gets in Q1 other than to say that we believe that we\u2019ve got positive pricing roll forward into Q1 and based on raw materials that the forward curves are constructive.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, guys. Rich, nice quarter.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So you ended up recording mid-20% incrementals in Q3 and you\u2019re projecting something close to that in Q4. It\u2019s still kind of in your range or close to your range of that 25% to 35%. So you talked about price versus cost starting to turn, as you look out into 2022, how much confidence does it give you that you could deliver incrementals at or above 25% to 35%, given all of the ongoing projects you have? You\u2019ve got productivity projects in DP. You\u2019ve got that structural cost that you always talk about. So do you have more confidence, given how well you\u2019ve performed with these headwinds this quarter?\nRichard Tobin: I think that we are -- I think that what we believe that is structural in nature in terms of the inflation is the labor. So if we\u2019re constructive about raw mats coming down somewhat and we\u2019re constructive about the lagging effect of price increases and inventory turns, that we believe, as I mentioned in my comments, that we can bring back the margin profile of the biggest impacted business that we have. In any given year, we expect to offset inflationary inputs at the factory level with productivity. Now we\u2019ve got to do a little bit more of that just because of the labor inflation but I think that that\u2019s doable.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Got it. And then maybe I can ask you specifically about DPPS. We know you\u2019ve been building out capacity in biopharma, you\u2019ve talked about that. I think you\u2019ve got some cyclical improvement in Precision Components. But this segment is up over 20% versus 2019 with a backlog that\u2019s up 90%. So I think people -- some people are worried about DPPS eventually running into more difficult comps. So based on your own organic investments, does DPPS stay one of your fastest growing segments and how would you say now that you -- can you maintain the recent margin performance that you\u2019ve had?\nRichard Tobin: Well, we get asked this every quarter and the answer is yes. As we talked about in the call, we have -- we\u2019re expanding capacity and we wouldn\u2019t be doing that, if we weren\u2019t proactive about the demand environment going into 2022. Do we get a little bit of margin fade due to mix? Maybe, but is it going to be material? No. So we look at it this way. We understand that this has been material in terms of the year-over-year profitability of the group. Would we rely on that level of profitability change moving forward from here? No. But I think that we\u2019ve got a lot of ammunition. Back to your other question about what we think that we can roll forward in the portfolio next year. So we don\u2019t need that kind of pickup next year, just relative to the size of the change in earnings this year.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate it Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey. Good morning guys and thanks for being bold and being first of reporting for stupidity, one of the two, but nonetheless\u2026\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Scott, go ahead.\nScott Davis: Yeah. Rich, you talked a little bit about how you\u2019re strategically building inventory, are your customers\u2019 strategically building inventory too? Is there a chance that some of the channel\u2019s getting a little fat in certain SKUs?\nRichard Tobin: Not in inventory. I mean it\u2019s a big question. Look, one of the thing we\u2019ve been discussing all year is the backlogs are so large. Is that being influenced? Sure, it\u2019s being influenced, because the supply chain constraints are becoming so difficult. No one wants to live with that next year. So lead times are stretching out and that\u2019s reflected in the backlog to a certain extent. I am not aware and based on the yelling and screaming that goes on around here about getting the product out the door, that we\u2019ve got any channels that are carrying excess inventory. Pretty much right now, everything that we can get out the door, our customers and distributors will take.\nScott Davis: Okay. And Rich, can you just help understand, you talked about curtailing some production. Are you talking about, I mean, logistically, help us understand what that means. Did you shut something down for a week and give everybody paid time-off? Is it just a shift here and there? I mean, what\u2019s the extent of when you do a shutdown like this and are you eating full labor costs and such in that time period or are there adjustments that are made with in that regard?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. It\u2019s a mixed bag. We have -- at a certain point you can\u2019t have half built or three-quarter built units. You just need the logistics. If you think about refrigeration units, you think about ESG truck bodies, you think about vehicle lifts, you just get to the point where the cost of reworking those goods, putting in those last pieces of component parts as they arrive, the math doesn\u2019t make sense and it gets really complicated and then you just say we need to stop. Sometimes you stop for two or three days. Sometimes, you stop for a shift depending on inventory deliveries and everything else. But I would tell you that it would -- a lot of it is driven by the size of the goods, if you think about it that way. I mean, if you\u2019re thinking about it like a pump, you can -- we\u2019ve got enough warehousing space to take that. If you\u2019re thinking about truck bodies and you\u2019re thinking about refrigerated -- refrigeration units, you get to the point where you\u2019re just better off taking the whole machine down for two days or three days. And when you do so, you don\u2019t carry all the labor but you carry most of it. So the negative absorption is what you would expect.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good luck in 4Q. Thanks, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to circle back, unfortunately, to this sort of price net of cost topic.\nRichard Tobin: Yeah.\nJulian Mitchell: Stepping back from the sort of quarterly back and forth, so for full year 2021, what is that net dollar price cost headwind, is it sort of $10 million that type of range? And then when we think about next year, do you think Dover should benefit from a lag as we see those forward cost curves come down, maybe that\u2019s reflected in the real costs coming in? What\u2019s the ability of your pricing to kind of hang in there relative to that cost normalization next year if we see it?\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Okay. The three components that we\u2019re talking, but we have -- I don\u2019t want to rewind the clock here, but we started in Q4 and Q1 of last year talking about raw material price cost, where we said at the time, we would be in neutrality, right? Then when we went from there to a labor inflationary environment and even more problematic supply chain and logistics, labor inflation, I am not even going to get into it. It\u2019s up to us to offset that just in terms of raw productivity. So where we are, and I think I gave you the number, it was $25 million to $30 million of negativity in the two segments that you see dilution in the quarter. We expect that to compress some in Q4, which is driven by two things, one is the revenue in Q4 relative to Q3 and the fact that you\u2019ve got a roll forward and the catch-up us on pricing as you work off older dated backlog. So as I was -- back to the question I was asked before, all things being equal, as that older dated backlog re-prices itself because of pricing actions taken through the year, that it becomes a negative -- it becomes a positive moving into Q1 under the assumption that things don\u2019t get worse from here and under the assumption that the market structure, the pricing in the market structure remains as it is today, which we believe it\u2019s going to, by the way.\nJulian Mitchell: Got it. And so through next year where you do get that spread or do you think the market is sort of too efficient for that?\nRichard Tobin: Well, we\u2019re going to have to fight it out Julian. And we\u2019ve taken the pain to make deliveries to our customers and we\u2019ve been having discussions with them that we\u2019re not re-pricing backlog in a lot of instances. So we are taking it through the P&L, which also means that as future prices of metals come down, we\u2019re also not re-pricing the backlog that we have and so our backlogs are actually up sequentially despite the fact having 15% growth. So it\u2019s not going to be easy but that\u2019s kind of the way that we\u2019re managing the process.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s very helpful. And just a last one on this point, so your gross margins up a lot in the first half, down slightly year-on-year in the third quarter. Should we assume by first quarter next year as things look today that it\u2019s up year-on-year again?\nRichard Tobin: Year-on-year again, you know what I don\u2019t have the gross margin for Q1 in my head. But I would assume that our projections for the majority of the portfolio are to grow the topline next year. I am not aware of negative mix -- segmental negative mix. So on absorption alone we would expect that.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Hey. Yes, guys. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Hey. Just in terms of supply chain disruption and folks talked about it, but could you quantify the magnitude of delayed shipments on third quarter revenue and if supply chain issues remained the same in fourth quarter? I mean, should we think about these showing up in 2022, I mean, what happens with all these delayed shipments?\nRichard Tobin: Well, first and foremost, our guidance incorporates our view of what happens going forward, number one. Number two, could we have shipped more in Q3? Clearly, we could have. I think that this argument about lost revenue is an interesting one, because everybody, I suppose, all market participants claimed lost revenue, because demand is high and supply constraints are tight. So monetizing that as lost is a little bit of a fool\u2019s game. We could have shipped out more in Q3. It would have reduced our backlog slightly is my presumption and I don\u2019t believe that it would allow us to ship more in Q4 materially.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And can you just touch on cadence of bookings as you went through the third quarter and any early feel for changes here in the fourth quarter, I mean, clearly, the end market looks robust, but maybe a little bit more color?\nRichard Tobin: I think that the last time we did this was August and we said that, it was -- August is always a choppy month for bookings, so we would have more clarity as we went through the quarter. Clearly, they\u2019ve got better in September and October based on the results that we\u2019ve posted. My expectation that, they will slow on a run rate basis going into Q4 because essentially, Q4 is already in backlog for the most part.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. That makes sense. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So, hey, Rich, just maybe going back to the supply chain discussion for a little bit, maybe a bigger picture question here. You have had some announcements from the government that they\u2019re trying to ease the supply chain issues by going to like a 24x7 model at the ports. What I am hearing from you is that like you\u2019re not really seeing much of an improvement at this point, but I want to make sure that like I am getting that correctly on the latest data point?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah.\nJoe Ritchie: And then just very curious like, what would you do, if you had to do like proactively change policy decisions, what would you do to try to ease some of this burden?\nRichard Tobin: Going and just announcing 24x7 operations as if you have all the employees and all of the moving parts to make that happen overnight is naive. I think the intent is there. But I think that if there\u2019s -- we don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be any demonstrable change in performance between now and the end of the year. It\u2019s just too complex of an ecosystem. I am not an economist. We\u2019ve been having -- if you go back and look at our comments all year long, this notion of transitory inflation and blaming used car prices has been naive at best. It\u2019s been manageable for corporates as corporates have priced inflation, but that is a how long is a piece of string argument. So coupled with a lot of other proposed agenda items that one conceivably could say would cause additional inflation and port congestion, I am not entirely sure that that\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s well thought out.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And I guess, maybe just kind of thinking about this pricing, the backlog. Clearly, backlog is in great shape going into next year, maybe even beyond. I guess the concern in the market is your ability to make sure you can get pricing or re-price portions of the backlog to meet what the cost environment looks like and so as you kind of look at your backlog and your portfolio, are there any areas where there\u2019s maybe a little bit more concern on potentially re-pricing the backlog or should we feel good going into 2022 that the margin on that backlog is in good shape?\nRichard Tobin: We are not re-pricing backlog materially in any portion of the group. We\u2019re actually doing quite the opposite. We\u2019re holding pricing in the backlog to the detriment of margins as we push the product out the door, because we believe that preserving our customer -- our strategic customer relationships and not forcing demand destruction is a more favorable equation than having fights about re-pricing backlog when we\u2019re actually re-pricing all new orders as we progress through the year. So the only negative scenario, that ends up being a rolling credit unless one wants to make an assumption about inflationary inputs getting worse going into 2022 from where the baseline is right now.\nJoe Ritchie: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Rich, just maybe first on some of these kind of bottlenecks that you guys are seeing. At what point, just based on what you can see in terms of what comes up next in the backlog or some sort of business mix, do you think you can get past that 2Q high watermark for what is able to get out the door? I imagine seasonality plays a role as well, but is that something that you have line of sight to right now and the way you guys are thinking about the next couple of quarters?\nRichard Tobin: I guess, I am allowed to make one positive comment since we\u2019re going to deconstruct all this. Remember that our margins are up quarter-to-quarter for the remaining here. Yeah, look, I mean, at the end of the day, Q3 was tough, I mean, for [Technical Difficulty] we still had COVID Delta going on at the time with absenteeism driven by that, which we\u2019re largely behind. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s fundamentally changed in our ability to manage output. It\u2019s been a little bit of a struggle. I think that we were, I guess, a little bit disappointed on the labor equation. We had projected it to get materially better in Q3 and it got a little bit better as we exited Q3, but the first couple of months were quite difficult. So I am not overly concerned on our ability to get to high watermarks and we\u2019ve got some relatively robust projections for revenue growth for 2022 and we\u2019ve got the footprint to deliver it. So, again, unless we want to make an assumption that supply constraints deteriorate from here, which we don\u2019t believe then I think that we\u2019re positioned appropriately just by the fact that we\u2019ve over ordered on the inventory side, at least we start off on the front foot.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then just specifically on Pumps & Process Solutions. I mean, you guys have a mountain of backlog there. It doesn\u2019t seem like the order intake is really slowing. I mean, just if you get down that backlog to a normal level and I don\u2019t know what normal is anymore, but it seems like that business sort of has to grow double digits next year. I mean, a little early on 2022, but like that isn\u2019t a long cycle business and you got more backlog than maybe you know what to do with, like what\u2019s missing in that equation?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I think, we mentioned it before. We\u2019re going to get into 2022 and if we\u2019re all positive about input costs and logistics and supply chain, backlogs are going to drop, right? Because lead times are going to shrink and everybody is going to panic and you shouldn\u2019t. So, I think, that the bottomline is, because of these constraints, backlog is good, it gives us a lot of visibility going into the year and our expectation that backlog -- that total backlog will fade proportionally, but that\u2019s actually a good sign. I am not going to give out growth rates by segment for 2022, as I mentioned in my comments. I think that we\u2019ve done our early looks at what 2022 is setting up to be and I think from a top line point of view, which is portfolio wide we\u2019re constructive.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Works for me. Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with all your questions.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Hey. So, obviously, the backlogs, not so much the backlog, the book-to-bill ratios have been off the scale. So I understand the lead times impacting backlogs, but book-to-bill has been very strong now for the last three or four quarters. I really want you to address the question of what\u2019s changed and what\u2019s different about this recovery versus the last couple, which have been pretty anemic, so what do you think is driving such strength here? And then maybe just address, you talked about how you\u2019re preordering or maybe buffering some of the components. To what extent do you think your customers are doing the same thing as well?\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Nigel, I think, I answered the question before that we do channel checks right now and we are not aware of inventory of our products being elevated in any of our end markets. Clearly, order rates are a reflection of backlog build and that\u2019s why order rates continue to be elevated and backlog has not come down despite the fact that the topline growth has been good. It will, like, the order -- the backlog will fade over time. I don\u2019t want to repeat myself over and over again here. So what\u2019s driving the recovery? I think a couple of things. From a Dover point of view, I think that the portfolio is a lot different than it was in the past. I think that clearly it looks like we\u2019re moving into a CapEx cycle in a lot of our end markets. We discussed refrigeration before, but that seems, we are getting quite proactive about the energy complex, for example, and I think that we\u2019ve got some market exposures with the biopharma platform that we\u2019ve had in the past that you can\u2019t compare. So, overall, I think, it\u2019s a combination of we\u2019ve expanded capacity in markets that are growing. So we\u2019ve got available product and the -- and that the profile of the end markets at Dover has changed meaningfully over the last five years.\nNigel Coe: Great. But the CapEx cycle is what I was trying to get at. You sound pretty confident we were in a CapEx cycle, that\u2019s great. And then the portfolio slide was really helpful, because your M&A has been -- maybe each deal flies by the radar a little bit, but when you add them together, they\u2019re meaningful. I mean, are you happy to maintain this kind of cadence with smaller bolt-on type deals but additive in aggregate? So do you think that there could be one or two larger opportunities down the road?\nRichard Tobin: We look at larger opportunities all the time. The problem with larger opportunities, the bigger the opportunity, the more it attracts in terms of interest, because of just scale and so pricing becomes difficult. If we look at where value has been created for Dover, historically, it\u2019s these bolt-ons that use the network effect of Dover that have been high value returners. So, I don\u2019t think we will ever stop doing the small ones, because I think that we\u2019ve got a lot of conviction behind that process. But would we like to do some bigger ones? Sure, we would. We just need to find the appropriate priced deals out there.\nNigel Coe: That\u2019s great. Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Deane.\nBrad Cerepak: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: Hey. Maybe we will stick with M&A but on the divestiture side.\nRichard Tobin: Okay.\nDeane Dray: And maybe just put in context the Unified Brand divestiture. Is it truly a one-off opportunistic divestiture or might it be the start of a pivot away from selectively in Refrigeration & Food Equipment?\nRichard Tobin: We evaluate annually market structure participation by all of our operating companies. The fact of the matter is over the last three years to four years the market structure in Foodservice Equipment has changed for a variety of reasons and we just did not believe that, Unified Brands within the Dover family was going to be able to extract the value and that it was more appropriately owned by someone that has the scale to participate in that structure.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s helpful. Could maybe -- you\u2019re not going to give specifics, I understand, but just how does that pipeline of potential divestitures, the pruning that you\u2019re doing, where does that stand?\nRichard Tobin: There\u2019s not a lot, right? Like I said, we evaluate it annually. We\u2019ve got a view of the value creation that\u2019s embedded in each piece of the portfolio. But as a multi-industrial, if we were to get an inbound request where the value paid is in excess or equal to the value that we think that we could create then we would have to take a look at it. But right now [Technical Difficulty] that we\u2019re actively looking at.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then just last one, to go back on pricing.\nRichard Tobin: Okay.\nDeane Dray: Rich, you talked about this during the quarter that you felt that a fourth price increase could actually start to result in some pushback demand destruction. You answered the question not re-pricing backlog. But just broadly within the businesses, are you seeing that sort of price elasticity coming through where a fourth price increase might be problematic?\nRichard Tobin: It depends, Deane. We have not been aggressive on re-pricing a backlog, because we take seriously our commitment when we accept an order that we accept to deliver against those commercial terms. But having said that, we have been sequentially moving on price primarily because of raw materials not so much due to labor and supply chain.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to slide six. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our topline organic revenue increased by 13% in the quarter, with all five segments posting growth, with strong demand in our Engineered Products, Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited the topline by about 1% or $21 million. Acquisitions added $18 million of revenue in the quarter. There was no year-over-year impact from dispositions. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America and Europe, our two largest regions and modest growth across Asia and the rest of the world. The U.S., our largest market, posted 16% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions and retail, industrial automation, biopharma and can making. Europe grew by 16% in the quarter on strong shipments in marking, coding, biopharma and industrial pumps, can making and heat exchangers. All of Asia was up 5% organically on growth of biopharma and industrial pumps and heat exchangers, partially offset by year-over-year declines in polymer processing, below-ground retail fueling and fuel transport. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia was up 8% organically in the quarter. Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 25% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all five segments. Let's go to the earnings bridges on slide seven. On the top of the chart, the adjusted segment EBIT was up $64 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved 80 basis points, as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset cost inflation and production stoppages. Going to the bottom chart, adjusted net earnings improved by $57 million, as higher segment EBIT and lower corporate expenses more than offset higher taxes. Deal expense in the quarter were $3 million. The effective tax rate for the third quarter excluding tax discrete benefits was approximately 21.8%, compared to 21.5% in the prior year. And our effective tax rate estimate pre-discreet for Q4 and the full year remains unchanged at 21% to 22%. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million for the quarter or $4 million higher than in 2020 or approximately $0.03 of year-over-year EPS impact. Rightsizing and other costs were a $2 million reduction to adjusted earnings in the quarter, as a one-time recovery related to a cancellation settlement more than offset our ongoing productivity and rightsizing initiatives. Now on slide eight. We're pleased with the cash performance thus far this year, with cash -- with free cash flow of $667 million, a $104 million increase over last year, free cash flow conversion stands at 11% of revenue year-to-date, despite a nearly $250 million investment in working capital. As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers strong order rates and we are carrying high inventory levels to ensure we can meet current demand for the rest of the year and into next year. Let me turn it back to Rich. Hi, Steve. That's all it. Right. Hi, Andrew. Good morning."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to page three. Dover Corporation and its operating companies had a solid quarter. The performance stats indicate that our product strategies, coupled with our ongoing productivity initiatives continued to deliver topline growth, margin accretion, and attractive cash flow to our investors. Our revenue and bookings growth continued to outpace our pre-pandemic levels and we exited the quarter with a record high and sequentially increased backlog while posting topline growth of 15% over the comparable period. Demand strength was broad-based as each segment posted year-over-year growth in bookings and a book-to-bill above 1. Revenue growth, product -- positive product mix, and ongoing productivity initiatives drove comparable operating margins up, resulting in a 31% increase in U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share. Our free cash flow performance was strong with an 18% year-over-year increase, despite significant investments we've made in inventory as we begin to reap the benefits of our investments in the centralization of financial processing activities. We continue to enhance and improve our portfolio with several acquisitions completed in the last three months and the divestiture of our commercial foodservice business announced last week. Our organic investments and capacity expansions and productivity projects are on track, providing us the building blocks for the future topline growth and margin expansion. As one of the first multi-industrials to report each quarter and because of our wide end market exposures, we have the pleasure to be the operating environment bellwether, so let's get on the front foot here by providing some color on inflationary inputs, labor, and supply chain challenges, so that we have time to discuss the constructive demand environment for 2022 in the Q&A. Let me start by saying that we're particularly concerned that there have been no discernible policy changes, particularly in the U.S. to deal with these headwinds, and in fact many proposed policies run the risk of extending their duration. We take no satisfaction in the fact that we've been telegraphing these issues all year and incorporating to the -- incorporating them into our forecast of the businesses that bear the brunt of these challenges, which I will expand upon during the segment review. We have taken the appropriate actions to offset these headwinds moving into 2022 and we are comforted by the fact that we have been given the opportunity to demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strength of the breadth of our product and geographic market exposures that are ultimately reflected in these quarterly results. To be clear, we are very constructive about 2022 demand for our products and services and remain optimistic that there will be a recognition that protecting the duration of the current strong economic demand environment needs proactive policy decisions. We are raising our full year EPS guidance as a result of our strong year-to-date performance. Our updated forecast do not incorporate any material improvement nor deterioration of the challenging operating environment in the fourth quarter. Our priorities remain the same supporting our customers with products and services for the long-term, and the health and welfare of our employees. I will skip to slide four, which provides a more detailed review of our results for the third quarter. So let's move to slide five. Engineered Products revenue was up 14% organically with a significant portion of the growth from pricing actions. Vehicle Services posted a strong topline quarter and market indicators remained positive, with vehicle miles driven recovering and average vehicle age continuing to increase. Industrial Automation demand was up double digits with strong activity in Americas and China. Environmental Services Group revenue was up year-over-year and its backlog remained strong moving into 2022. Aerospace and Defense posted a decline year-over-year, largely a result to changes in programmed shipment timing. The margin performance in the quarter was unfortunately what we expected to occur as we progressed through the year. Our Engineered Products segment, as we've discussed previously, has the largest exposure to raw materials, assembly labor as a percentage of cost of goods, and supply chain complexity. As such, it is more than just a price cost issue where even an equilibrium drives negative margin performance. It is exasperated by numerous component supply issues that necessitated us to intermittently curtail production to stabilize the manufacturing system in the quarter. Our management team is doing exactly what we would expect of them to protect profitability in the short-term, while managing the relationships with our strategically important customers. I have absolute confidence that the profit margin in the segment will bounce back as we move into 2022 as a result of actions already taken in price and as raw materials and supply chain constraints moderate as can be seen in the raw materials futures and stabilizing container shipping rates. Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on solid demand in North America for above-ground and below-ground retail fueling. We believe our production schedule and delivery times are driving share gains particularly in the above-ground category. Vehicle wash posted another strong quarter with some encouraging customer conversion and cross-selling benefits from our recent ICS acquisition. Activity in China remains subdued, driven by the lasting impacts of COVID and near-term uncertainty related to energy supply. Fuel Transport Components were negative for the quarter, but we believe that this is [expected to] (ph) improve moving forward. Margins in the segment declined 150 basis points in the quarter, as productivity headwinds from supply chain constraints and subcomponents and negative mix more than offset higher volumes and pricing. We have taken the appropriate actions on pricing to counter these headwinds going forward. Sales in Imaging & Identification grew 7% organically. The core Marking and coding business grew well on good demand for printers and consumables. Serialization Software also grew ahead of expectations and we are working to add additional resources here as we integrate the recently acquired Blue Bite brand management software into our solutions. The Digital Textile Printing business was up significantly year-over-year against a low bar comparable quarter and is continuing its gradual recovery. Margins in Imaging & ID improved by 250 basis points as volume leverage, pricing, and productivity initiatives more than offset input cost inflation. Pumps & Process Solutions posted another solid quarter at 25% organic growth. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong. We continued to expand clean room capacity for our biopharma connectors and single-use pumps in the period, and we are encouraged by specification wins in Em-tec Biopharma flow meters, which we acquired last year. Industrial Pumps were up based on broad-based end customer demand with particular strength in China. Precision Components was up year-over-year as compression OEM and aftermarket businesses continued their recovery. Polymer Processing was down in the quarter due to a combination of shipment timing and a very strong third quarter from the prior year, though new order rates remained strong and outlook is positive moving into 2022. Margins in the quarter expanded by a robust 630 basis points on strong volume, fixed cost absorption, favorable product mix, and pricing. Topline results in Refrigeration & Food Equipment remained strong, posting 16% organic growth. Revenue in beverage can-making equipment doubled in the quarter. The business is booked into late 2022 and is taking orders for 2023. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in all geographies, led by residential heating and industrial end markets and a recovery in the global commercial HVAC demand. Order intakes continue to exceed our ability to ship, so we are adding additional capacity in two geographies to ensure that we can meet forecasted demand in 2022. Demand in Food Retail remains robust with elevated bookings and backlogs across all our product lines. However, much like our Engineered Products business, we have a difficult time with labor constraints, and in particular, subcomponent supply, which has necessitated significant operational cost in logistics, intermediate production curtailments, and in one case, deferment of a delivery into 2022. Again, management is straddling cost recovery actions and meeting demands of our customers, but it clearly comes with a cost. Margins were largely flat in the quarter as excellent operating performance and swept and Belvac offset refrigeration headwinds despite their smaller revenue base. I will pass it to Brad here. Thanks, Brad. I am on slide nine, which is a familiar format we used during the Investor Day in 2019 to describe our inorganic growth priorities. I am pleased to report that our activity since then has aligned well with those priorities and we remain busy adding logical logistic bolt-ons that will support the long-term growth of our core businesses. As you can see that we are investing in the highest priority platforms with an emphasis on high growth, high gross margin products and solutions. We remain disciplined in our approach to acquisitions and despite the challenging asset prices in today's environment, we have acquired seven bolt-on acquisitions year-to-date that meet our investment return criteria, including two in the third quarter and one that closed last week. The most recent deals highlighted in green were CDS, an industrial 3D visualization software, which we expect to grow in third-party revenues and also adopt across the Dover portfolio in our journey towards digitizing the front-end of our businesses, lowering our transaction costs. SP, which complements our Aerospace and Defense business, a software-driven signal intelligence solutions and LIQAL, which is an emerging leader in LNG and hydrogen dispensing solutions. Each transaction is modest addition to our aggregate portfolio, but we are very excited about scaling up these innovative and strategic technologies over time, and the positive impact to EPS as these investments mature. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions and have a solid M&A pipeline that aligns well with our portfolio priorities. We also took advantage of recent market activity in the Food Equipment sector to sell Unified Brands, a professional cooking equipment business for commercial foodservice operators. The deal was announced in early October and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Unified Brands represents less than 2% of our overall revenue and its sale will have a negligible impact on our 2021 adjusted EPS. I would like to thank the management and employees of Unified Brands for the many years of service in the Dover family. As we look to the end of the year, demand outlook remains favorable across the majority of the portfolio, backlogs and bookings remain robust and we expect to post strong organic growth in Q4. Overall, we remain on track to deliver strong returns this year through a combination of robust growth in revenue, operating profit and cash flow, coupled with disciplined capital allocation. We also look forward to closing out this year and laying the foundation for what we believe to be a positive demand environment in 2022. We have clarity about the nature of the inflationary input and supply disruption costs that we incurred in Q3 and expect to queue in Q4 due to the challenging operating environment and we have conviction that we can turn them into profitability tailwinds as conditions improve and the calendar progresses from here. Before wrapping up, I would like to thank Dover for all their preservers and accomplishments executing in today's environment. And with that, let's turn it to Q&A. Hi, Jeff. We were not price cost neutral in the quarter in the segments where you can see the dilution at the operating margin. So, it's a little bit of a two-fold story. Where we're getting the most price is where we're getting impacted the most, because not only you are driving with price increases, driving the topline, even in equilibrium that's dilutive to operating margins. So, when you're in a negative position, you get kind of a 300-point dilution. So the bad news is we're not in equilibrium in Q3. From here, we'd begin to squeeze that down in Q4 and if conditions don't deteriorate go positive moving into 2022. Yeah. I think that we're hopeful that we can get out what we're projecting in our guidance. Clearly, not in the -- not only in the revenue but the EPS, we're driving towards the top end here. But it's a normal Q4 despite and Brad went over cash flow. We will run for cash somewhat at the end of the year. We have certain businesses that are seasonal that don't deliver much in December and then we lose production days just because of Thanksgiving and Christmas. So, we're talking about double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter into Q4, and we're going to endeavor to get it out, Jeff. Hi. Yeah. I mean there's three buckets, right? There is raw materials, there's logistics and supply chain, and then there's business interruption costs that we incurred during the quarter. The vast majority of the negative impact is reflected in the segments that you can see, and a conservative view of what that cost was in the quarter is somewhere in the order of $25 million to $30 million in EBIT lost. That compresses in Q4 on a lower revenue line. That's all three. That's all three. Because a lot of it is still in inventory, so you've got that role based on -- you've got the raw materials inventory and you've got the orders in backlog and depending on when you took the orders and when they cycle through. So... ... two most effective businesses that we have, the price cost in total, including all three categories narrows from the number that I just gave you, but it does not get positive. Without getting granular here, it may get positive on raw materials, but not pick up logistics on the logistics side. From a total portfolio point of view, I think, that we are in neutrality in Q4. Well, look, I mean, as Brad mentioned, we're carrying the inventory, so we won't liquidate all of that in Q4. So to a certain extent, we are over ordering on the component side just because it's a little bit of a whackable. It was hydraulics back in Q2 and to a certain extent at the beginning of Q3. That's lightening up and now its electronic components. So, it's a myriad of stuff, but unfortunately, all it takes is one missing piece here. It seems like it's getting -- it's not getting worse. I guess is what I am saying. I am a bit concerned about policy decisions making it worse. I don't have a lot of faith in announcements about port activity having a demonstrable impact in the short run, quite frankly. But I think that because of the fact that we've been over ordering to a certain extent ourselves, I think it should modulate. But I am not ready to prognosticate about how much better it gets in Q1 other than to say that we believe that we've got positive pricing roll forward into Q1 and based on raw materials that the forward curves are constructive. Thanks. Thanks, Andy. I think that we are -- I think that what we believe that is structural in nature in terms of the inflation is the labor. So if we're constructive about raw mats coming down somewhat and we're constructive about the lagging effect of price increases and inventory turns, that we believe, as I mentioned in my comments, that we can bring back the margin profile of the biggest impacted business that we have. In any given year, we expect to offset inflationary inputs at the factory level with productivity. Now we've got to do a little bit more of that just because of the labor inflation but I think that that's doable. Well, we get asked this every quarter and the answer is yes. As we talked about in the call, we have -- we're expanding capacity and we wouldn't be doing that, if we weren't proactive about the demand environment going into 2022. Do we get a little bit of margin fade due to mix? Maybe, but is it going to be material? No. So we look at it this way. We understand that this has been material in terms of the year-over-year profitability of the group. Would we rely on that level of profitability change moving forward from here? No. But I think that we've got a lot of ammunition. Back to your other question about what we think that we can roll forward in the portfolio next year. So we don't need that kind of pickup next year, just relative to the size of the change in earnings this year. Thanks. Okay. Scott, go ahead. Not in inventory. I mean it's a big question. Look, one of the thing we've been discussing all year is the backlogs are so large. Is that being influenced? Sure, it's being influenced, because the supply chain constraints are becoming so difficult. No one wants to live with that next year. So lead times are stretching out and that's reflected in the backlog to a certain extent. I am not aware and based on the yelling and screaming that goes on around here about getting the product out the door, that we've got any channels that are carrying excess inventory. Pretty much right now, everything that we can get out the door, our customers and distributors will take. Yeah. It's a mixed bag. We have -- at a certain point you can't have half built or three-quarter built units. You just need the logistics. If you think about refrigeration units, you think about ESG truck bodies, you think about vehicle lifts, you just get to the point where the cost of reworking those goods, putting in those last pieces of component parts as they arrive, the math doesn't make sense and it gets really complicated and then you just say we need to stop. Sometimes you stop for two or three days. Sometimes, you stop for a shift depending on inventory deliveries and everything else. But I would tell you that it would -- a lot of it is driven by the size of the goods, if you think about it that way. I mean, if you're thinking about it like a pump, you can -- we've got enough warehousing space to take that. If you're thinking about truck bodies and you're thinking about refrigerated -- refrigeration units, you get to the point where you're just better off taking the whole machine down for two days or three days. And when you do so, you don't carry all the labor but you carry most of it. So the negative absorption is what you would expect. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. Okay. The three components that we're talking, but we have -- I don't want to rewind the clock here, but we started in Q4 and Q1 of last year talking about raw material price cost, where we said at the time, we would be in neutrality, right? Then when we went from there to a labor inflationary environment and even more problematic supply chain and logistics, labor inflation, I am not even going to get into it. It's up to us to offset that just in terms of raw productivity. So where we are, and I think I gave you the number, it was $25 million to $30 million of negativity in the two segments that you see dilution in the quarter. We expect that to compress some in Q4, which is driven by two things, one is the revenue in Q4 relative to Q3 and the fact that you've got a roll forward and the catch-up us on pricing as you work off older dated backlog. So as I was -- back to the question I was asked before, all things being equal, as that older dated backlog re-prices itself because of pricing actions taken through the year, that it becomes a negative -- it becomes a positive moving into Q1 under the assumption that things don't get worse from here and under the assumption that the market structure, the pricing in the market structure remains as it is today, which we believe it's going to, by the way. Well, we're going to have to fight it out Julian. And we've taken the pain to make deliveries to our customers and we've been having discussions with them that we're not re-pricing backlog in a lot of instances. So we are taking it through the P&L, which also means that as future prices of metals come down, we're also not re-pricing the backlog that we have and so our backlogs are actually up sequentially despite the fact having 15% growth. So it's not going to be easy but that's kind of the way that we're managing the process. Year-on-year again, you know what I don't have the gross margin for Q1 in my head. But I would assume that our projections for the majority of the portfolio are to grow the topline next year. I am not aware of negative mix -- segmental negative mix. So on absorption alone we would expect that. You're welcome. Good morning. Well, first and foremost, our guidance incorporates our view of what happens going forward, number one. Number two, could we have shipped more in Q3? Clearly, we could have. I think that this argument about lost revenue is an interesting one, because everybody, I suppose, all market participants claimed lost revenue, because demand is high and supply constraints are tight. So monetizing that as lost is a little bit of a fool's game. We could have shipped out more in Q3. It would have reduced our backlog slightly is my presumption and I don't believe that it would allow us to ship more in Q4 materially. I think that the last time we did this was August and we said that, it was -- August is always a choppy month for bookings, so we would have more clarity as we went through the quarter. Clearly, they've got better in September and October based on the results that we've posted. My expectation that, they will slow on a run rate basis going into Q4 because essentially, Q4 is already in backlog for the most part. Thank you. Hi, Joe. Yeah. Going and just announcing 24x7 operations as if you have all the employees and all of the moving parts to make that happen overnight is naive. I think the intent is there. But I think that if there's -- we don't believe there's going to be any demonstrable change in performance between now and the end of the year. It's just too complex of an ecosystem. I am not an economist. We've been having -- if you go back and look at our comments all year long, this notion of transitory inflation and blaming used car prices has been naive at best. It's been manageable for corporates as corporates have priced inflation, but that is a how long is a piece of string argument. So coupled with a lot of other proposed agenda items that one conceivably could say would cause additional inflation and port congestion, I am not entirely sure that that's a strategy that's well thought out. We are not re-pricing backlog materially in any portion of the group. We're actually doing quite the opposite. We're holding pricing in the backlog to the detriment of margins as we push the product out the door, because we believe that preserving our customer -- our strategic customer relationships and not forcing demand destruction is a more favorable equation than having fights about re-pricing backlog when we're actually re-pricing all new orders as we progress through the year. So the only negative scenario, that ends up being a rolling credit unless one wants to make an assumption about inflationary inputs getting worse going into 2022 from where the baseline is right now. Hi, Josh. I guess, I am allowed to make one positive comment since we're going to deconstruct all this. Remember that our margins are up quarter-to-quarter for the remaining here. Yeah, look, I mean, at the end of the day, Q3 was tough, I mean, for [Technical Difficulty] we still had COVID Delta going on at the time with absenteeism driven by that, which we're largely behind. There's nothing that's fundamentally changed in our ability to manage output. It's been a little bit of a struggle. I think that we were, I guess, a little bit disappointed on the labor equation. We had projected it to get materially better in Q3 and it got a little bit better as we exited Q3, but the first couple of months were quite difficult. So I am not overly concerned on our ability to get to high watermarks and we've got some relatively robust projections for revenue growth for 2022 and we've got the footprint to deliver it. So, again, unless we want to make an assumption that supply constraints deteriorate from here, which we don't believe then I think that we're positioned appropriately just by the fact that we've over ordered on the inventory side, at least we start off on the front foot. Well, I think, we mentioned it before. We're going to get into 2022 and if we're all positive about input costs and logistics and supply chain, backlogs are going to drop, right? Because lead times are going to shrink and everybody is going to panic and you shouldn't. So, I think, that the bottomline is, because of these constraints, backlog is good, it gives us a lot of visibility going into the year and our expectation that backlog -- that total backlog will fade proportionally, but that's actually a good sign. I am not going to give out growth rates by segment for 2022, as I mentioned in my comments. I think that we've done our early looks at what 2022 is setting up to be and I think from a top line point of view, which is portfolio wide we're constructive. Hi, Nigel. Okay. Nigel, I think, I answered the question before that we do channel checks right now and we are not aware of inventory of our products being elevated in any of our end markets. Clearly, order rates are a reflection of backlog build and that's why order rates continue to be elevated and backlog has not come down despite the fact that the topline growth has been good. It will, like, the order -- the backlog will fade over time. I don't want to repeat myself over and over again here. So what's driving the recovery? I think a couple of things. From a Dover point of view, I think that the portfolio is a lot different than it was in the past. I think that clearly it looks like we're moving into a CapEx cycle in a lot of our end markets. We discussed refrigeration before, but that seems, we are getting quite proactive about the energy complex, for example, and I think that we've got some market exposures with the biopharma platform that we've had in the past that you can't compare. So, overall, I think, it's a combination of we've expanded capacity in markets that are growing. So we've got available product and the -- and that the profile of the end markets at Dover has changed meaningfully over the last five years. We look at larger opportunities all the time. The problem with larger opportunities, the bigger the opportunity, the more it attracts in terms of interest, because of just scale and so pricing becomes difficult. If we look at where value has been created for Dover, historically, it's these bolt-ons that use the network effect of Dover that have been high value returners. So, I don't think we will ever stop doing the small ones, because I think that we've got a lot of conviction behind that process. But would we like to do some bigger ones? Sure, we would. We just need to find the appropriate priced deals out there. Hi, Deane. Okay. We evaluate annually market structure participation by all of our operating companies. The fact of the matter is over the last three years to four years the market structure in Foodservice Equipment has changed for a variety of reasons and we just did not believe that, Unified Brands within the Dover family was going to be able to extract the value and that it was more appropriately owned by someone that has the scale to participate in that structure. There's not a lot, right? Like I said, we evaluate it annually. We've got a view of the value creation that's embedded in each piece of the portfolio. But as a multi-industrial, if we were to get an inbound request where the value paid is in excess or equal to the value that we think that we could create then we would have to take a look at it. But right now [Technical Difficulty] that we're actively looking at. Okay. It depends, Deane. We have not been aggressive on re-pricing a backlog, because we take seriously our commitment when we accept an order that we accept to deliver against those commercial terms. But having said that, we have been sequentially moving on price primarily because of raw materials not so much due to labor and supply chain. You're welcome."

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were strong across the board and we are especially pleased with the top-line performance considering the complicated operating environment. The demand environment in the quarter was robust and continued the momentum from the first quarter and despite posting a 30% organic top-line growth, we exit Q2 with a sequentially higher order backlog. I'll focus on the bigger picture here and highlight again what we believe is underappreciated aspect of our portfolio, it's organic growth potential. Our revenue in the second quarter was above the pre-pandemic comparable quarter in 2019 and resulted in the highest revenue first half of the year in recent Dover history, meaning that the majority of our markets are not simply recovering but are operating in a growth environment. New order bookings remain robust with all segments posting book-to-bill above one; resulting in sequential comparable growth in backlog as I mentioned earlier. Operating margin conversion was solid for the quarter as a result of good execution at the operating level on healthy mix of products delivered in the quarter. All of this is well and good, but make no mistake, the operating environment remains very challenging. It's been 90 days since the last time we were asked the question about the duration of \"transitory inflation\". As we've discussed after the first quarter, we had some line of sight of raw materials cost trajectory coming into the year, which allowed us to get in front from a price cost perspective. We have also proactively given our operating companies some leeway on working capital decisions to build inventories based on the backlog trajectory. What we underestimated was the -- was the total cost impacts of a strained logistics system and tight labor market that shows no signs of abating. This has had two knock-on effects on our results. First, the absolute costs of inbound and outbound freight were materially higher, and second and more important, the costs associated with production line stoppages due to lack of labor and components caused by trends and time uncertainty and overall supply chain tightness. I'll deal with the market dynamics and supply chain impact by business later in the presentation, but based on our experience so far, I'm concerned about the notion that the current economy needs to be further stimulated and second order implications of that line of thinking and I'll leave it at that. Our teams have done a commendable job navigating these choppy waters and continue shipping products and driving robust margin conversion and strong cash flow. Overall, we believe that our operating model has been an advantage to us as we are largely a localized producer and are not overly reliant on extended supply chains. This is clearly reflected in our top-line performance in the quarter. As we look to the second half of the year, our order backlogs make us confident in our top-line trajectory. Our forecast do not incorporate much in the way of an improvement nor deterioration of the operating challenges that we've witnessed during the first half. We're just going to have to power through and work with our suppliers and customers to adapt to the prevailing conditions. We are raising our annual revenue growth guidance to 15% to 17%, and our adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30 a share to $7.40 a share. We also expect stronger cash flow as a result of the improved margin performance. Skip to Slide 4, which provides a more detailed overview of our results in the quarter. Engineered Products revenue was up 25% organically. Vehicle services which is strong across all geographies and product lines and had record bookings during the quarter. Industrial automation demand was strong across the automotive sector and in China. Aerospace and defense posted an all-time record revenue during the second quarter. Waste hauling was flat year-over-year as the business continues to wrestle with component and labor availability issues that are constraining product shipments. Importantly, waste handling bookings were robust and the backlog was up nearly 75% versus the prior year. Engineered Products is our most exposed segment to input and logistics cost inflation due to materials intensity, contractual pricing dynamics and relatively higher share of international sourcing in vehicle services. You can see it in the margin -- the segment's margin was flat year-over-year as strong volume leverage and pricing increases were offset by input cost and freight inflation, as well as labor and component availability challenges. Fueling Solutions was up 25% organically in the quarter on the strength of the above ground and below ground retail fueling globally, including some remaining tailwinds from the EMV opportunity in the U.S. following the April deadline. Vehicle wash has had -- has been strong this year and our recent ICS acquisition integration and performance is ahead of plan. Activity in China in fuel transport remains subdued, but there are signs of Chinese operators reopening their tendering activity. Order backlogs were up 29%, and we expect our software and service business hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance-driven underground product offerings to help offset the anticipated headwinds from the EMV roll-off. The segment posted another strong sequential margin performance on higher volumes, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity actions and mix. Sales in Imaging & ID improved 20% organically. The core marking & coding business grew well on strong printer demand across all geographies with China and India driving particularly strong performance. Serialization software also grew ahead of expectations. The digital textile printing business was up significantly against the comparable quarter when much of their operations were locked down in Northern Italy last year, but nevertheless, the business remains impacted though we are beginning to see growth in demand for large printers, particularly in Asia and continued growth in ink consumable volumes. Margins improved by 420 basis points on volume leverage, pricing and productivity initiatives. Pumps & Process Solution posted another banner quarter at 34% organic growth on improved volumes across all businesses except Precision Components. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps are intended to be -- to be strong driven by vaccine and non-COVID related pharmaceutical tailwinds. Industrial pumps grew by over 20% on robust end customer demand with particular strength in China. Polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year and continued strength in Asia and is gaining momentum in the U.S. market. Precision Components was slightly down in the quarter though demand conditions have stabilized and are recovering well in some end markets and geography giving us confidence in the second half trajectory. Margins in the quarter expanded by 910 basis points on strong volumes, favorable mix and pricing. Top-line growth in Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its impressive clip posting a 44% organic growth. Revenue in the beverage can making doubled in the quarter and bookings nearly doubled as well. The business is now booked into late 2022. Food retail saw broad-based growth across its product lines, door cases are now booking into 2022, and the demand for natural refrigerants is driving outside growth in our systems business in the U.S. and in Europe. Backlog in food retail is now double where it was last year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in all geographies with rebounding order rates and commercial HVAC in North America and record order intake in EMEA extending lead times for heat pumps and boilers. Foodservice equipment was up in the quarter on a tough comp, chain -- no, actually on an easy comp, and chain restaurant demand is robust, but the institutional market is still recovering. Margins in the segment improved by 580 basis points, driven by strong volumes and productivity actions partially offset by availability issues with installation raw materials and labor and food retail operations, we expect -- which we expect to subside in the second half. And I'll pass it on to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6 of the presentation deck, on the top of the -- on the top of the page is the revenue bridge. Our top-line organic revenue increased by 30% in the quarter with all five segments posting growth with particular strength in our Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited the top-line by about 5% or $68 million. Acquisitions added $19 million of revenue in the quarter. There were no year over impacts from dispositions. The revenue breakdown by geography reflect strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our three largest regions. The U.S., our largest market posted 25% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions in retail fueling, marking & coding, biopharma, food retail and can making. Europe grew by 30% on strong shipments in vehicle aftermarket, biopharma and industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia was up 38% organically on growth in biopharma, marking & coding, plastics and polymers, heat exchangers and retail fueling demand outside of China. China, which represents a little over half of our business in Asia was up 33% organically in the quarter. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were up 61% organically, reflecting continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all five segments. Going to the earnings bridges now on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted EBIT was up $173 million and margin improved 400 basis points, as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. Adjusted segment EBITDA was up 350 basis points. Going to the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $135 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes, as well as higher corporate expenses primarily relating to compensation accruals and deal expenses. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.6% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $11 million in the quarter or $9 million higher than 2020 for approximately $0.07 of a year-over-year EPS impact. Rightsizing and other costs were $11 million in the quarter or $8 million after-tax. Now, on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance thus far this year, with free cash flow of $364 million, a $96 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 9% of revenue for the first half of the year, 80 basis points higher than the comparable period last year, despite a significant investment in working capital and the impact of prior year tax deferrals that did not repeat this year. Also as we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers' strong order rates and build inventory to ensure we can meet the current demand in the second half of the year. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay, thanks, Brad. Let's try to pause here for a moment, because this is a complicated slide, but I think it's a transparent view of what we think is going to happen over the second half of the year and includes our current view of the outlook of the second half by segment provides context of how we are thinking about full year guidance, which I'll get to shortly. Remember, the demand environment is strong across the portfolio, so let's not try to get overexcited about headwinds or mix commentary. We managed it in H1 and we will do it again in H2, but this is the reality of the situation in terms of the dynamic of the business. We expect top-line growth -- top-line in Engineered Products to remain robust through the remainder of the year based on solid backlog and good bookings trajectory. Momentum in the vehicle aftermarket, industrial automation should continue, while we expect the improved order rates and backlogs and solid waste handling and industrial winches to drive solid year-over-year growth in the second half. Aerospace and defense is expected to be modestly down largely as a result of a difficult year-over-year comparison on -- on project deliveries. Supply chain constraints and cost inflation are expected to continue to have a material impact on the segment. Waste handling and automotive aftermarket businesses are our largest business exposed to the trifecta of raw materials inflation, extended supply chains and a larger proportion of assembly labor. Our management teams are winning in the marketplace considering the headwinds which is reflected in the growth rate and order books. But we are clearly at the point of having defend our market position at the expense of the price cost dynamic, which will be detrimental to near-term margins, but not material, slightly detrimental. And we expect Fueling Solutions to provide organic growth for the full year above our initial expectations on the back of growth in systems and software, recovering underground demand and vehicle wash. Recall that above ground business as a tough second half due to the North American EMV volumes. Margins in Fueling Solutions will be up for the full year, though we expect modest margin compression in the second half relative to the first half on slightly lower volumes and negative product and geographic mix, which I think that we covered at the end of Q1 as with less North America volume due to EMV and more international volume that's slightly dilutive. Trading conditions in Imaging & ID are expected to continue their positive trajectory for the remainder of the year. Our core marking & coding business is expected to maintain its growth trajectory with services and serialization products positively impacting performance. Digital textile printing is recovering, and we expect the end of the year, we will well above 2020, but below its 2019 high watermark. We expect operating margins to remain stable in the second half. Pumps & Process Solutions should see a solid second half. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remain robust with customers now placing orders into 2022. We are strategically investing an additional clean room capacity for this platform to support its growth. Trading conditions in industrial pumps are strong and driven by robust and customer demand as opposed to channel stocking. Plastics and polymers is expected to be steady though this business faces a difficult comparable period due to a strong performance last year. Precision Components will return to growth in the second half as OEM new-builds will supplant increased activities at refineries and petrochemical plants. We expect margins to remain strong in the segment, but we may see some minor dilution due to mix on the back half as our Precision Components business recovers, but the absolute profit trajectory of this segment is in very good shape. With its large backlog and high sustained order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment will finish the year strong, with double-digit growth expected for all operating businesses. New orders in core food retail business have been healthy across the product segments and the tailwinds from our leadership position and natural refrigerants are driving outside growth for our systems business. We expect to begin to significantly ramp up shipments of our new digital door product. Belvac continues to work through its record backlogs. They are now taking orders for late 2022 and even into 2023. Heat exchanger business is positioned well as they are seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We have been investing in capacity and new capabilities in these two businesses and are well positioned to capture the growth. Foodservice equipment demand is normalized and returned to growth at restaurant chains and institutional business continues to improve. We expect this business to post solid growth in the second half albeit against a low comparable. We expect margins to continue their seasonally adjusted upward trajectory for the remainder of the year. Improved volume leverage, productivity gains and positive product mix and business mix should more than offset operational challenges related to component and labor shortages, increased logistics costs and input cost inflation. Moving to Slide 10. We remain on the front foot investing behind our business to support the growth, productivity and long-term portfolio enhancement. Organic high return on investment projects remain our top priority for capital allocation. On the left hand, you can see a sample of the current growth and productivity CapEx projects that we are working on, that add up to $75 million of spend. The project mix is balanced between growth and productivity with a skew towards new capacity and supporting long-term growth in key priority portions of our portfolio. Our next priority in capital allocation is strategic bolt-on acquisitions and enhance the long-term growth profile and attractiveness of our portfolio. You can see that with that all four of our recent acquisitions were in either digital or high growth single use pumps markets. These are small additions, but we are very excited about scaling up these highly innovative technologies as part of our G&A portfolio. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions, have a solid M&A pipeline as we enter the second half. Our current dry powder on a full year '21 basis is approximately $3.3 billion. Our revised annual guidance is on Page 11. We are increasing our top-line forecast to reflect the durability and demand trends that we are seeing. We now expect to achieve 15% to 17% all-in revenue growth this year. Our $0.55 adjusted EPS guidance increase is mindful of the supply chain, and input challenges we summarized earlier in the presentation and we expect free cash flow generation to edge higher as well due to margin improvements. On the bottom of the page, we show our expected '21 performance in a multi-year perspective. We remain on track to deliver strong returns through a combination of robust organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and disciplined capital allocation. Before wrapping up, I want to thank everybody at Dover for their perseverance and accomplishments executing in today's challenging environment. And with that, Andrey, we'll open it up to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys, Rich, nice quarter.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Rich, can you give more color into what you're seeing in terms of margin progression in Pumps & Process and Refrigeration. I know you just talked about it, but if you look at Pumps & Process, you've been sustaining that 30% level, can you keep doing that, and I know you talked about a little dilution there? And then on the refrigeration side, like how would you assess the sort of march toward that mid-teens margin goal that you've talked about?\nRichard Tobin: On the Pumps & Process Solutions side of the portfolio, nothing deteriorates in the second half, it's just pure mix. So what I'm -- what I was trying to make clear is one of the businesses that suffered greatly last year and is beginning to improve now is our Precision Components business that is slightly dilutive to margins, but in terms of absolute profit, it's a positive, so I wouldn't get overly chuffed about that. On the refrigeration side, we expect third quarter margins to be the highest of the year just based on seasonality and the size of our backlog and everything else. Quite frankly, we're a bit disappointed in the margin in Q2, but I don't think that's the fault of management, but we've had a really difficult time with freight costs and components and labor availability. So on one hand, I think the effort on their part to get the product out the door was excellent. The bottom line is we disappointed a bunch of customers in our ability to get the product out because of the supply chain issue. So the trajectory is good and as you can see from the backlogs, this is more of a 2022 story now more than a 2021 story.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then we know you want to be conservative given all the crosscurrents out there, but you're obviously forecasting revenue to come off a bit from Q2 with a backlog up 70%, you talked about EMV coming down, supply chain, the virus is still out there, but you didn't mention in your release that you have visibility already into '22. So maybe you can just talk about that visibility, and obviously it's in refrigeration, but is it across all the businesses, so that organic growth could actually be quite strong as you go into '22?\nRichard Tobin: Well, look, I mean, I'm not going to complain about the size of our backlog, and if you'd run the calc and -- if you'd run the calcs on that we couldn't get it out the door over the balance of the year if we wanted to. So it's up to execution, number one. And with the exception of Belvac and Maag, most of our business is short cycle. So we'll see at the end of Q2 [ph]. I mean, look at the end of the day and it's the same discussion we had at the end of Q1. The demand is there, it's up to us to get it out the door. I think that when all is said and done, I think that we probably are going to do better on average because of our -- because I think that we're advantaged from a supply chain point of view versus some of our competitors, and that's what's going to be winning in the marketplace. It's not so much a pricing dynamic right now, it's whether you can get the product out the door. So we -- I think that right now I don't in my tenure here, we've never had backlogs like this and it's a good problem to have.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thank you, Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just kind of digging into Andy's question a little bit of a different way. I think normally you guys convert your first half orders relatively close as a percentage into sales from first half to second half. Obviously, that suggests like a kind of a stupidly high revenue number for the year relative to your guidance like $700 million higher. Obviously, there is supply constraints and things may be getting pushed into '22. Can you maybe just talk about like the mechanics of this backlog, what's converting, what's different when it comes to the conversion from orders into sales this cycle, if you will? I mean I'm sure it's much more extended obviously, this cycle or maybe like just mechanically, is there double ordering going on, is there our guys pushing deliveries into '22, just a little more of the mechanics around that?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. I think that we discussed it a little bit at the end of Q1. Clearly, based on our backlogs of exit in Q1 and then Q2 because of the demand function was going to be higher than kind of what a normal seasonality would be just because of where the demand was. So it's just purely a function of where you could get it out the door or not at the end of the day. So that's the good news. So I don't think you can look at Q2 and just say, well, I'm going to go back and look at history and then Q3 is this much higher than Q2 and then that it's going to spit out a number as you said, that's just not realistic quite frankly. So as point number one, so I'd be careful about calculating seasonality based on history just because of the strength of the first half just because of the recovery coming out of the pandemic. In terms of the backlog, yes, we'd have to break it down because we've got some long cycle backlog, I mean we mentioned Belvac, which is booking into 2023 now is a piece of that, that we'll just convert over time. We don't believe that there's double ordering going on right now. From what we can tell, it looks like it's just a recognition by the customer base of the constraints that are out in the system that in previous periods you just didn't have to put the orders in, you want to get in line. So that is what is expanding the backlog. I mean, I think you asked the question at the end of Q1 about this whole issue of channel stocking, destocking, and we took a close look, I mean, we grew our industrial pumps business by 20% in the quarter. So we took a or over that actually, but so we took a close look at channel checks and we don't see that inventory building up at our distributors, it's just passing right through. So that's good news at the end of the day, because it means it's fundamental demand. So I think it's two issues. We've got some long cycle businesses that are booking out well further than historically they used to and then I think on our short cycle businesses, I think there is a recognition of the constraints in the supply chain that's just making everybody get in line further out than they normally would have.\nSteve Tusa: And I guess on that front on the working capital side, is there any unwind of this big inventory and receivables, I guess not receivables because your sales are going to continue to grow, but on the inventory side, I mean, any flush you see in the second half, I know you raised your free cash flow guidance, but if there is anything to nitpick at this quarter would be the working capital build was kind of sizable, any unwind there in the second half?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, I think the working capital build has been to our advantage and we'll see after everybody reports in terms of top-line, I mean, having the product available or having the components available that convert has been an advantage to us. I don't see anything fundamentally deteriorating in our working capital. We will see in the second half. I would expect to see some -- to see liquidation in Q4. And if we don't on the industrial working capital side, that means that the demand outlook for '22 is robust and what we may carry it again, but I don't think that just means higher earnings and the out -- and the outside period. So right now sitting here, we would expect free cash flow to be up, no real deterioration in terms of the metrics of working capital. We'll leave it at that to see how order rates progress over the balance of the year.\nSteve Tusa: Great, thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thanks, good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Rich, maybe just touch a little bit more on M&A, right, I mean you've been doing some bolt-ons, but as you know, we've got a kind of multi-billion dollar capacity here, activity seems to be picking up in your neighborhood, right. I wonder if a, you see things kind of trading away from you that you are interested in or just kind of the action ability of what you might have in your pipeline?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, without getting into the specifics, I think that we lost out on one deal that we chased pretty hard due to valuation, some of the other ones that you've seen transact, we're well aware of those assets and we're not participating in them. Bottom line is, it's a good news, bad news story. I mean, the bad news is, is valuations are what they are and I'll leave it at that. The good news is because valuations are what they are, then there is a lot building up that wants to come to market, because I think this is a recognition of, these are the salad days for multiples of not even earnings anymore, but of whatever you want to choose to be the multiple. So we're looking at a lot of stuff right now and we're going to remain disciplined. I mean, I think the things that we've got there are small, but we think that the network effect on the leverage of those small products is, our expectation, the returns are going to be very high in the deals that we did and we'll see in the second half.\nJeff Sprague: And a unrelated different question, just back to kind of price and how you're managing all this, what are you doing differently, I'm sure you can use the demand pulse to just extract price that people want the product bad enough, but are you able to on a drive deposits do other things to just kind of improve the commercial terms of how you're transacting with folks?\nRichard Tobin: It depends, I think because demand is high and capacity is tight. You can manage profitability by customer probably a little bit more efficiently than in the past, but I think in certain of our businesses and I'll go back to what I talked about at Engineered Products, when you get to the third price increase, do you actually go for the fourth price increase because the fact of the matter is, you run the risk of demand destruction in the short-term, and that's not good. So part of my comment about Engineered Products, especially around ESG and VSG is at a certain point if we go negative in terms of price cost, but the volume remains robust and the installed base goes up, that's a better trade because we believe that some of these supply chain constraints and raw materials will roll off hopefully sooner than later. And you know what, do you really go back to your core customers and say sorry, but here comes another price increase. So I think that we're managing differently across the portfolio, but we don't want to force short-term demand destruction by trying to just be draconian.\nJeff Sprague: Great, makes sense, active management. Appreciate it, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, yes, good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, how are you? Just a question just to sort of to continue sort of to talk about capital allocation. You did sort of highlight over $3 billion in dry powder. How should we think, you sort of clearly have established yourself as one of the most consistent operators post COVID. So how do you think about sort of the pace that you would like, right, get assume that valuation stay where they are, but how do you see the pace of capital allocation per year in a normalized environment assuming that prices stay where they are?\nRichard Tobin: I don't know how to answer that. I -- look well, I'll put it in this way, Andrew, where we realistically looking at right now is about two-thirds of our dry powder. Now do we execute on that or not, I'm not sure, but I just in terms of the amount of targets and a realistic view of what the value of those targets are is about two-thirds of our dry powder. So it's quite a bit at the end of the day. But it's a realistic view and there are some deals that we just can't get there. I mean, this notion that return on invested capital made a quantum leap from three years to five years over the last 12 months, I find an interesting dynamic. And I'm not here to criticize anybody's deals, everybody has got their own strategy to a certain extent. So my -- like I said before to Jeff's question, the bad news is valuation, the good news is there's a lot of assets that see valuations of transactions in the marketplace. So the amount of opportunities that are out there and ones that are rumored to come is actually proactive to capital deployment.\nAndrew Obin: That's a great answer. Thank you. And then the other question maybe I missed it, but did you comment on what the price increase was in the second quarter and what are you modeling for second half of the year?\nRichard Tobin: The price to raw materials improves in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. The outlier is logistics costs and line stoppages, which is really the negative headwind, but priced cost on a raw material side, it's actually better in the second half than the first half.\nAndrew Obin: But what was the price component of organic growth in second quarter?\nBrad Cerepak: [Indiscernible] around that number, not that significant.\nAndrew Obin: And then...\nBrad Cerepak: It really comes down to, Andrew, it comes down to the timing of when those price increases. Rich is saying there is multiple times that price is being put in. So it's not one big bang at January 1, it kind of spreads across the year. So you get that effect.\nAndrew Obin: Now, now I got it. Looking at your price reaction today, I don't think anybody is complaining about your execution. Thanks so much.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Scott.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi, Scott.\nScott Davis: Is there any way to kind of convert, Rich, you made the comment of disappointing customers, I mean, do you -- can you convert that to kind of an on-time delivery number to us and kind of what's normal and what you're at now and or any way to kind of think about it other than subjectively?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, there's really two dynamics. I think that our lead times are disappointing to our customers, because you go for years where you can convert orders within with intra-month in some of our businesses where that's just not possible. And that -- and that's where you get this function of now everybody seen it for six months and so it's got a knock-on effect of backlogs because there is a recognition of this is -- this -- this is more durable than maybe everybody thought. So the positive is it builds your backlogs at the end of the day, the negative is our lead times have stretched out. Now, you couple that with in certain of our businesses where we've had some pretty difficult logistics constraints and in some cases labor availability and then you've got disappointment of we say we're going to deliver the product on X date and we miss it and that's happened. So we can quant -- we quantify it more in dollars and cents. I'd have to go look up in terms of on-time delivery. I think across the board, it's probably okay, but there is, as I mentioned before, a business like VSG that's got probably our longest extended supply chain is suffering the most as opposed to Printing and ID that just doesn't have to deal with the reality of that.\nScott Davis: Okay, now that's fair point. So just to follow-up, I mean, all the questions on M&A I think are appropriate just given where your leverage ratio is. But you could flip it over and just say well valuations are crazy, why not sell some assets here because you do have a fairly broad portfolio and some things seemed a bit better than others and is there any appetite to doing so?\nRichard Tobin: No, I think that -- I think that's a fair comment. I guess that's all I can say about that, but you're right, right, valuations inbound and outbound are what they are and you can manage that both ways.\nScott Davis: Yes. Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back maybe to Slide 9. So just to try and understand essentially is the point here that sort of this is largely relating to a half on half margin outlook and so sort of company-wide second half segment margins may be down slightly versus the first half, and then within that you've sort of got DEP and DFS may be down a bit DRFE flattish, and then DII and DPPS flat to up half on half. Is that the right sort of summary of that slide, just to make sure it's sort of half on half we're looking at?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I think that if you overlay the, my comments on to the slide, they're going to match, right. I think that we're just giving you an honest assessment based on the prevailing market conditions of where we have headwinds operationally, price cost and then some commentary on mix, which is a commentary H1 to H2. So as I mentioned in my comments, I don't think we have to be overly dramatic about it. We've managed it quite well in -- in the first half and I don't expect us to manage it differently in the second half, but we have to recognize that there are certain decisions that we're making, like if you look at DEP in terms of price cost which whether from an absolute profit point of view may be in good shape with slightly dilutive margins because we're just making a choice to chase the -- to chase the volume, which I think is appropriate in that case.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very clear. And then, secondly looking at the cash flow, you've addressed the working capital point once or twice. Capital spending is up a decent amount this year, I think the sort of low double-digit type increase year-on-year. Just trying to think about sort of the outlook from here, how much does that reflect the sort of catch-up spend, you laid out some projects in the deck after a weaker CapEx number last year for obvious reasons, and how much is this sort of a sustainably higher level, just trying to understand how your capital intensity looks on the CapEx front beyond 2021, should we see CapEx normalize lower again or will be flat when we look at next year?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, I think that '20 we can just throw out, right. I mean, at the end of the day everybody reacted to the change in market conditions appropriately. So, like as a percent of revenue and we'll see where we end up and I don't want to do the calculations here, but as a percent of revenue, '19 to '21 is probably flattish and I would expect that to be the same going into '22. I mean, we -- one of these days we're going to do a presentation on our returns for organic investment and they absolutely blow away anything that we do inorganically. So to the extent that we find the projects going into '22, we'll spend it internally, but right now sitting here today, do I expect as a percent of our revenue to go up dramatically in '22, no.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Because I think -- yes, there is a lot of sort of broader chats about CapEx super cycles and this and that, which I think is a bit odd. It doesn't sound like from Dover's sort of internal outlook that there is anything game changing in terms of CapEx intensity as we look out?\nRichard Tobin: Well, you know, I think that there is an interesting argument and I would agree with it that to the extent that labor inflation is durable and that supply chains, the issues that we're having supply chains will improve, but not dramatically. There is an argument to be made that the returns on automation are going to be better than they've been over the last five years to six years, and I would agree with that.\nJulian Mitchell: Interesting. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Joe.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So, I'm going to -- I'm going to ask Julian's question maybe a little bit more explicitly on the margins for the second half of the year. And so it sounds like, Rich, you guys have done a great job managing those historically. When I look at Slide 9, it basically what I'm hearing from you is that incremental margins are probably going to be pretty comparable to the kind of 30% range that you just put up in the second quarter, maybe there is some slight pressure, but that's kind of how you're thinking about those in the second half, is that fair?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I think that we're just trying to be transparent, Joe, right. It's very -- we could have put up the second quarter results and said everything is great and see at next quarter and then gotten away with it, but I think that we have to recognize that there are some issues that need to be overcome. To us, I don't think that we should get overly excited about it. It's just the facts are the facts we've dealt with them in H1, if anything, it becomes more of a mix issue in Q2 and that's not problematic. So as I mentioned before, DRFE is going to have its best quarter of the year from a revenue and an operating margin point of view. So that's great in terms of absolute profit, but it is dilutive to overall Group margins. So am I going to tell them to slow down to protect the margin, no at the end of the day. And that's the case -- and there's a couple of other, a couple of our businesses. I mean, if Precision Components on the back half revenue increases, but it's slightly dilutive to a, let's call it a very robust margin that we're clocking at Pumps and Process Solutions, again, I don't think it's overly problematic, but we're just trying to guide everybody of a look at the margin in Q2, but from a seasonality point of view, if I go back and look in history, Q3 is X percent higher than Q2. So let me just model that and run down the field. I think that would -- would give you a number that we would like to get to, but I'm not entirely sure just because of the pull-forward in terms of the demand and the operating leverage that we're getting in Q2.\nBrad Cerepak: Right. We got to be a little bit careful with the conversion to the back half as well because price materials does impact conversion. So just keep that in mind is that, that has nothing to do with absolute profits per se as Rich has talked about, but the conversion rate is influenced by that.\nJoe Ritchie: Sure. Now that makes sense and fully appreciate all the color you guys are providing. I guess my one follow-up and maybe just kind of focus on the near-term for a second. When you think about third quarter from a pure revenue and EPS perspective, would you expect it to be up versus the second quarter or similar? I'm just curious like how you guys are thinking about it with the way that the backlog is kind of converting into your business?\nRichard Tobin: Similar, I guess is the answer.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird.\nMig Dobre: Yes, thank you for taking the question. I also want to ask a question about Slide 9. You've got...\nBrad Cerepak: That's cool.\nMig Dobre: Yes.\nRichard Tobin: Next quarter, I'm going to look at slides. All right, go ahead.\nBrad Cerepak: You're going to kill that slide, but let's go ahead.\nMig Dobre: You've got a -- you've got positive commentary on price cost for DII and DPPS, and just kind of looking through your disclosures in the queue, these were the segments with frankly the smallest pricing gains in the quarter, both of them a little over 1%. So I find that to be a little bit counter-intuitive right, you've got less of a pricing tailwind in these two yes you -- yet you expect better price cost dynamic. Can you may be put a finer point on this as to what's happening with these two?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I think Brad addressed it in an earlier question. Everybody -- we don't do our pricing on January 1st, right. It's done differently. There's signaling effect to manage backlogs. So you basically in certain businesses will say, we're going to do a price increase at the end of Q1, meaning so you lose that clocking period in Q1. So it actually ramps over the balance of the year on the comp. So again it is just a reflection of the timing of those price increases and the age kind of the H1, H2 effect of that.\nMig Dobre: Okay, got it. Sorry, I missed that. Then I guess my follow up just sort of looking at your order intake, right, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, Pumps & Process Solutions, in both these segments, you're running well ahead of what we saw pre-COVID. And I guess my question is, if we're not talking about some kind of a CapEx super cycle here, what is really happening with these end markets, and is it fair for us to think that this is sustainable to some degree into 2022 or is there a hangover to be expected here as things normalize? Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: We see -- I think I've tried to answer this about 15 different ways. I think that, that backlogs are building which is a reflection of constraints in the system. So I think when we get to next year, it's going to be an interesting dynamic because as those constraints come down, then lead times are going to come down, which is going to be negative to backlogs to a certain extent. But that I think that Steve asked the question or maybe wrote it earlier today, I think we're going to get -- we got to be careful with absolute backlogs and doing math on it and trying to extrapolate revenues into the future. I mean, the bottom line is that backlogs build and shrink based on lead times and market conditions and everything else. So could I envision a scenario where backlogs come down, yes. Do I think that's overly problematic, no, because to a certain extent, that means the headwinds that we have on supply chain logistics are getting better, which is better for margins at the end of the day.\nMig Dobre: Yes. So Rich, to clarify I wasn't talking about backlog because I totally agree with what you're saying. I was wondering more about your bookings, right, which have been very, very strong year-to-date even relative to pre-COVID?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, well, look, I mean I think that we are executing really, really well in Pumps & Process Solutions. I mean we made a presentation on that on what we thought was coming at the end of '20. And look and as I mentioned at the end of Q1, we think that we are in at minimum a three-year cycle of the demand function on DRFE which is positive. And it's not just -- it's across the board, it's not just door cases, it's systems business, it's SWEP on the heat exchangers and it's Belvac, all of which we believe are in a multi-year cycle.\nMig Dobre: Great, thanks for the color.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nBrad Cerepak: Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: Hey, I know we covered a lot of ground here. It came up multiple times about component and labor shortages. So Rich, if you could just take us through like where is it most acute today on the component side, is it semiconductors, printed circuit boards, are you qualifying new suppliers. So that's the component side, and then on the labor side, any color there, unfilled positions are you expecting a significant step-up in labor costs as this needs to adjust. So take us through that if you could?\nRichard Tobin: Hope boy, well, we've got a pretty wide portfolio, I'll make some general comments about the components. They're all tied. They are more problematic if they're large and imported, because if you take a look at what's going on when the logistics supply chain in the Port of Los Angeles and all that, it is a bloody mess right now, which only impacts a small portion of our portfolio, because as I mentioned in my comments at the end of the day, we think that we are winning in the marketplace because we don't have a lot of instances of that. If you've got very long supply chains and it's containerized freight coming out of Asia back to North America to fulfill demand, you are suffering quite frankly. On the labor side, it's purely in our operations that I have a higher propensity of assembly labor, and for all the reasons that we can understand that's been difficult. I think it's not getting worse as we move through the second quarter, which is a good news. So, hopefully in September, when some of these government influence in terms of the labor market begins to roll off that it will get better and everybody is going to go back to school in September. So our view right now is it's probably going to remain difficult through August, and I think that we're hopeful in September that the situation is fine.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. And then last one for me, just you talked about this last quarter and how did it play out where you said you were going to give the business units more autonomy in managing their own working capital that you gave them the green light, go ahead and build inventory, and I know there were some surprise there because you hadn't done that before, but how has that worked out, is that going to be a permanent, was that a one-time event just you needed to get in front of this demand, but just some color there would be helpful? Thanks.\nRichard Tobin: I mean, if the demand holds up then we'll continue to kind of given that latitude because the absolute profit versus the carrying cost of the working capital, the math works, I guess the best way I can say it. I would expect if we get improvement in the logistics supply chain that it will come down naturally, because that's what's really driving it at the end of the day. We're basically given the green light to everybody of, you've got the backlog, don't be reticent of trying to get the sub components in because we want to convert.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period, and Dover's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6 of the presentation deck, on the top of the -- on the top of the page is the revenue bridge. Our top-line organic revenue increased by 30% in the quarter with all five segments posting growth with particular strength in our Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited the top-line by about 5% or $68 million. Acquisitions added $19 million of revenue in the quarter. There were no year over impacts from dispositions. The revenue breakdown by geography reflect strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our three largest regions. The U.S., our largest market posted 25% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions in retail fueling, marking & coding, biopharma, food retail and can making. Europe grew by 30% on strong shipments in vehicle aftermarket, biopharma and industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia was up 38% organically on growth in biopharma, marking & coding, plastics and polymers, heat exchangers and retail fueling demand outside of China. China, which represents a little over half of our business in Asia was up 33% organically in the quarter. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were up 61% organically, reflecting continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all five segments. Going to the earnings bridges now on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted EBIT was up $173 million and margin improved 400 basis points, as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. Adjusted segment EBITDA was up 350 basis points. Going to the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $135 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes, as well as higher corporate expenses primarily relating to compensation accruals and deal expenses. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.6% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $11 million in the quarter or $9 million higher than 2020 for approximately $0.07 of a year-over-year EPS impact. Rightsizing and other costs were $11 million in the quarter or $8 million after-tax. Now, on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance thus far this year, with free cash flow of $364 million, a $96 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 9% of revenue for the first half of the year, 80 basis points higher than the comparable period last year, despite a significant investment in working capital and the impact of prior year tax deferrals that did not repeat this year. Also as we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers' strong order rates and build inventory to ensure we can meet the current demand in the second half of the year. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Hi. [Indiscernible] around that number, not that significant. It really comes down to, Andrew, it comes down to the timing of when those price increases. Rich is saying there is multiple times that price is being put in. So it's not one big bang at January 1, it kind of spreads across the year. So you get that effect. Hi, Scott. Thanks, Joe. Right. We got to be a little bit careful with the conversion to the back half as well because price materials does impact conversion. So just keep that in mind is that, that has nothing to do with absolute profits per se as Rich has talked about, but the conversion rate is influenced by that. That's cool. You're going to kill that slide, but let's go ahead. Good morning."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were strong across the board and we are especially pleased with the top-line performance considering the complicated operating environment. The demand environment in the quarter was robust and continued the momentum from the first quarter and despite posting a 30% organic top-line growth, we exit Q2 with a sequentially higher order backlog. I'll focus on the bigger picture here and highlight again what we believe is underappreciated aspect of our portfolio, it's organic growth potential. Our revenue in the second quarter was above the pre-pandemic comparable quarter in 2019 and resulted in the highest revenue first half of the year in recent Dover history, meaning that the majority of our markets are not simply recovering but are operating in a growth environment. New order bookings remain robust with all segments posting book-to-bill above one; resulting in sequential comparable growth in backlog as I mentioned earlier. Operating margin conversion was solid for the quarter as a result of good execution at the operating level on healthy mix of products delivered in the quarter. All of this is well and good, but make no mistake, the operating environment remains very challenging. It's been 90 days since the last time we were asked the question about the duration of \"transitory inflation\". As we've discussed after the first quarter, we had some line of sight of raw materials cost trajectory coming into the year, which allowed us to get in front from a price cost perspective. We have also proactively given our operating companies some leeway on working capital decisions to build inventories based on the backlog trajectory. What we underestimated was the -- was the total cost impacts of a strained logistics system and tight labor market that shows no signs of abating. This has had two knock-on effects on our results. First, the absolute costs of inbound and outbound freight were materially higher, and second and more important, the costs associated with production line stoppages due to lack of labor and components caused by trends and time uncertainty and overall supply chain tightness. I'll deal with the market dynamics and supply chain impact by business later in the presentation, but based on our experience so far, I'm concerned about the notion that the current economy needs to be further stimulated and second order implications of that line of thinking and I'll leave it at that. Our teams have done a commendable job navigating these choppy waters and continue shipping products and driving robust margin conversion and strong cash flow. Overall, we believe that our operating model has been an advantage to us as we are largely a localized producer and are not overly reliant on extended supply chains. This is clearly reflected in our top-line performance in the quarter. As we look to the second half of the year, our order backlogs make us confident in our top-line trajectory. Our forecast do not incorporate much in the way of an improvement nor deterioration of the operating challenges that we've witnessed during the first half. We're just going to have to power through and work with our suppliers and customers to adapt to the prevailing conditions. We are raising our annual revenue growth guidance to 15% to 17%, and our adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30 a share to $7.40 a share. We also expect stronger cash flow as a result of the improved margin performance. Skip to Slide 4, which provides a more detailed overview of our results in the quarter. Engineered Products revenue was up 25% organically. Vehicle services which is strong across all geographies and product lines and had record bookings during the quarter. Industrial automation demand was strong across the automotive sector and in China. Aerospace and defense posted an all-time record revenue during the second quarter. Waste hauling was flat year-over-year as the business continues to wrestle with component and labor availability issues that are constraining product shipments. Importantly, waste handling bookings were robust and the backlog was up nearly 75% versus the prior year. Engineered Products is our most exposed segment to input and logistics cost inflation due to materials intensity, contractual pricing dynamics and relatively higher share of international sourcing in vehicle services. You can see it in the margin -- the segment's margin was flat year-over-year as strong volume leverage and pricing increases were offset by input cost and freight inflation, as well as labor and component availability challenges. Fueling Solutions was up 25% organically in the quarter on the strength of the above ground and below ground retail fueling globally, including some remaining tailwinds from the EMV opportunity in the U.S. following the April deadline. Vehicle wash has had -- has been strong this year and our recent ICS acquisition integration and performance is ahead of plan. Activity in China in fuel transport remains subdued, but there are signs of Chinese operators reopening their tendering activity. Order backlogs were up 29%, and we expect our software and service business hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance-driven underground product offerings to help offset the anticipated headwinds from the EMV roll-off. The segment posted another strong sequential margin performance on higher volumes, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity actions and mix. Sales in Imaging & ID improved 20% organically. The core marking & coding business grew well on strong printer demand across all geographies with China and India driving particularly strong performance. Serialization software also grew ahead of expectations. The digital textile printing business was up significantly against the comparable quarter when much of their operations were locked down in Northern Italy last year, but nevertheless, the business remains impacted though we are beginning to see growth in demand for large printers, particularly in Asia and continued growth in ink consumable volumes. Margins improved by 420 basis points on volume leverage, pricing and productivity initiatives. Pumps & Process Solution posted another banner quarter at 34% organic growth on improved volumes across all businesses except Precision Components. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps are intended to be -- to be strong driven by vaccine and non-COVID related pharmaceutical tailwinds. Industrial pumps grew by over 20% on robust end customer demand with particular strength in China. Polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year and continued strength in Asia and is gaining momentum in the U.S. market. Precision Components was slightly down in the quarter though demand conditions have stabilized and are recovering well in some end markets and geography giving us confidence in the second half trajectory. Margins in the quarter expanded by 910 basis points on strong volumes, favorable mix and pricing. Top-line growth in Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its impressive clip posting a 44% organic growth. Revenue in the beverage can making doubled in the quarter and bookings nearly doubled as well. The business is now booked into late 2022. Food retail saw broad-based growth across its product lines, door cases are now booking into 2022, and the demand for natural refrigerants is driving outside growth in our systems business in the U.S. and in Europe. Backlog in food retail is now double where it was last year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in all geographies with rebounding order rates and commercial HVAC in North America and record order intake in EMEA extending lead times for heat pumps and boilers. Foodservice equipment was up in the quarter on a tough comp, chain -- no, actually on an easy comp, and chain restaurant demand is robust, but the institutional market is still recovering. Margins in the segment improved by 580 basis points, driven by strong volumes and productivity actions partially offset by availability issues with installation raw materials and labor and food retail operations, we expect -- which we expect to subside in the second half. And I'll pass it on to Brad here. Okay, thanks, Brad. Let's try to pause here for a moment, because this is a complicated slide, but I think it's a transparent view of what we think is going to happen over the second half of the year and includes our current view of the outlook of the second half by segment provides context of how we are thinking about full year guidance, which I'll get to shortly. Remember, the demand environment is strong across the portfolio, so let's not try to get overexcited about headwinds or mix commentary. We managed it in H1 and we will do it again in H2, but this is the reality of the situation in terms of the dynamic of the business. We expect top-line growth -- top-line in Engineered Products to remain robust through the remainder of the year based on solid backlog and good bookings trajectory. Momentum in the vehicle aftermarket, industrial automation should continue, while we expect the improved order rates and backlogs and solid waste handling and industrial winches to drive solid year-over-year growth in the second half. Aerospace and defense is expected to be modestly down largely as a result of a difficult year-over-year comparison on -- on project deliveries. Supply chain constraints and cost inflation are expected to continue to have a material impact on the segment. Waste handling and automotive aftermarket businesses are our largest business exposed to the trifecta of raw materials inflation, extended supply chains and a larger proportion of assembly labor. Our management teams are winning in the marketplace considering the headwinds which is reflected in the growth rate and order books. But we are clearly at the point of having defend our market position at the expense of the price cost dynamic, which will be detrimental to near-term margins, but not material, slightly detrimental. And we expect Fueling Solutions to provide organic growth for the full year above our initial expectations on the back of growth in systems and software, recovering underground demand and vehicle wash. Recall that above ground business as a tough second half due to the North American EMV volumes. Margins in Fueling Solutions will be up for the full year, though we expect modest margin compression in the second half relative to the first half on slightly lower volumes and negative product and geographic mix, which I think that we covered at the end of Q1 as with less North America volume due to EMV and more international volume that's slightly dilutive. Trading conditions in Imaging & ID are expected to continue their positive trajectory for the remainder of the year. Our core marking & coding business is expected to maintain its growth trajectory with services and serialization products positively impacting performance. Digital textile printing is recovering, and we expect the end of the year, we will well above 2020, but below its 2019 high watermark. We expect operating margins to remain stable in the second half. Pumps & Process Solutions should see a solid second half. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remain robust with customers now placing orders into 2022. We are strategically investing an additional clean room capacity for this platform to support its growth. Trading conditions in industrial pumps are strong and driven by robust and customer demand as opposed to channel stocking. Plastics and polymers is expected to be steady though this business faces a difficult comparable period due to a strong performance last year. Precision Components will return to growth in the second half as OEM new-builds will supplant increased activities at refineries and petrochemical plants. We expect margins to remain strong in the segment, but we may see some minor dilution due to mix on the back half as our Precision Components business recovers, but the absolute profit trajectory of this segment is in very good shape. With its large backlog and high sustained order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment will finish the year strong, with double-digit growth expected for all operating businesses. New orders in core food retail business have been healthy across the product segments and the tailwinds from our leadership position and natural refrigerants are driving outside growth for our systems business. We expect to begin to significantly ramp up shipments of our new digital door product. Belvac continues to work through its record backlogs. They are now taking orders for late 2022 and even into 2023. Heat exchanger business is positioned well as they are seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We have been investing in capacity and new capabilities in these two businesses and are well positioned to capture the growth. Foodservice equipment demand is normalized and returned to growth at restaurant chains and institutional business continues to improve. We expect this business to post solid growth in the second half albeit against a low comparable. We expect margins to continue their seasonally adjusted upward trajectory for the remainder of the year. Improved volume leverage, productivity gains and positive product mix and business mix should more than offset operational challenges related to component and labor shortages, increased logistics costs and input cost inflation. Moving to Slide 10. We remain on the front foot investing behind our business to support the growth, productivity and long-term portfolio enhancement. Organic high return on investment projects remain our top priority for capital allocation. On the left hand, you can see a sample of the current growth and productivity CapEx projects that we are working on, that add up to $75 million of spend. The project mix is balanced between growth and productivity with a skew towards new capacity and supporting long-term growth in key priority portions of our portfolio. Our next priority in capital allocation is strategic bolt-on acquisitions and enhance the long-term growth profile and attractiveness of our portfolio. You can see that with that all four of our recent acquisitions were in either digital or high growth single use pumps markets. These are small additions, but we are very excited about scaling up these highly innovative technologies as part of our G&A portfolio. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions, have a solid M&A pipeline as we enter the second half. Our current dry powder on a full year '21 basis is approximately $3.3 billion. Our revised annual guidance is on Page 11. We are increasing our top-line forecast to reflect the durability and demand trends that we are seeing. We now expect to achieve 15% to 17% all-in revenue growth this year. Our $0.55 adjusted EPS guidance increase is mindful of the supply chain, and input challenges we summarized earlier in the presentation and we expect free cash flow generation to edge higher as well due to margin improvements. On the bottom of the page, we show our expected '21 performance in a multi-year perspective. We remain on track to deliver strong returns through a combination of robust organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and disciplined capital allocation. Before wrapping up, I want to thank everybody at Dover for their perseverance and accomplishments executing in today's challenging environment. And with that, Andrey, we'll open it up to Q&A. Thanks, Andy. On the Pumps & Process Solutions side of the portfolio, nothing deteriorates in the second half, it's just pure mix. So what I'm -- what I was trying to make clear is one of the businesses that suffered greatly last year and is beginning to improve now is our Precision Components business that is slightly dilutive to margins, but in terms of absolute profit, it's a positive, so I wouldn't get overly chuffed about that. On the refrigeration side, we expect third quarter margins to be the highest of the year just based on seasonality and the size of our backlog and everything else. Quite frankly, we're a bit disappointed in the margin in Q2, but I don't think that's the fault of management, but we've had a really difficult time with freight costs and components and labor availability. So on one hand, I think the effort on their part to get the product out the door was excellent. The bottom line is we disappointed a bunch of customers in our ability to get the product out because of the supply chain issue. So the trajectory is good and as you can see from the backlogs, this is more of a 2022 story now more than a 2021 story. Well, look, I mean, I'm not going to complain about the size of our backlog, and if you'd run the calc and -- if you'd run the calcs on that we couldn't get it out the door over the balance of the year if we wanted to. So it's up to execution, number one. And with the exception of Belvac and Maag, most of our business is short cycle. So we'll see at the end of Q2 [ph]. I mean, look at the end of the day and it's the same discussion we had at the end of Q1. The demand is there, it's up to us to get it out the door. I think that when all is said and done, I think that we probably are going to do better on average because of our -- because I think that we're advantaged from a supply chain point of view versus some of our competitors, and that's what's going to be winning in the marketplace. It's not so much a pricing dynamic right now, it's whether you can get the product out the door. So we -- I think that right now I don't in my tenure here, we've never had backlogs like this and it's a good problem to have. Thanks. Good morning, Steve. Sure. I think that we discussed it a little bit at the end of Q1. Clearly, based on our backlogs of exit in Q1 and then Q2 because of the demand function was going to be higher than kind of what a normal seasonality would be just because of where the demand was. So it's just purely a function of where you could get it out the door or not at the end of the day. So that's the good news. So I don't think you can look at Q2 and just say, well, I'm going to go back and look at history and then Q3 is this much higher than Q2 and then that it's going to spit out a number as you said, that's just not realistic quite frankly. So as point number one, so I'd be careful about calculating seasonality based on history just because of the strength of the first half just because of the recovery coming out of the pandemic. In terms of the backlog, yes, we'd have to break it down because we've got some long cycle backlog, I mean we mentioned Belvac, which is booking into 2023 now is a piece of that, that we'll just convert over time. We don't believe that there's double ordering going on right now. From what we can tell, it looks like it's just a recognition by the customer base of the constraints that are out in the system that in previous periods you just didn't have to put the orders in, you want to get in line. So that is what is expanding the backlog. I mean, I think you asked the question at the end of Q1 about this whole issue of channel stocking, destocking, and we took a close look, I mean, we grew our industrial pumps business by 20% in the quarter. So we took a or over that actually, but so we took a close look at channel checks and we don't see that inventory building up at our distributors, it's just passing right through. So that's good news at the end of the day, because it means it's fundamental demand. So I think it's two issues. We've got some long cycle businesses that are booking out well further than historically they used to and then I think on our short cycle businesses, I think there is a recognition of the constraints in the supply chain that's just making everybody get in line further out than they normally would have. Well, I mean, I think the working capital build has been to our advantage and we'll see after everybody reports in terms of top-line, I mean, having the product available or having the components available that convert has been an advantage to us. I don't see anything fundamentally deteriorating in our working capital. We will see in the second half. I would expect to see some -- to see liquidation in Q4. And if we don't on the industrial working capital side, that means that the demand outlook for '22 is robust and what we may carry it again, but I don't think that just means higher earnings and the out -- and the outside period. So right now sitting here, we would expect free cash flow to be up, no real deterioration in terms of the metrics of working capital. We'll leave it at that to see how order rates progress over the balance of the year. Thanks. Hey, Jeff. Yes, without getting into the specifics, I think that we lost out on one deal that we chased pretty hard due to valuation, some of the other ones that you've seen transact, we're well aware of those assets and we're not participating in them. Bottom line is, it's a good news, bad news story. I mean, the bad news is, is valuations are what they are and I'll leave it at that. The good news is because valuations are what they are, then there is a lot building up that wants to come to market, because I think this is a recognition of, these are the salad days for multiples of not even earnings anymore, but of whatever you want to choose to be the multiple. So we're looking at a lot of stuff right now and we're going to remain disciplined. I mean, I think the things that we've got there are small, but we think that the network effect on the leverage of those small products is, our expectation, the returns are going to be very high in the deals that we did and we'll see in the second half. It depends, I think because demand is high and capacity is tight. You can manage profitability by customer probably a little bit more efficiently than in the past, but I think in certain of our businesses and I'll go back to what I talked about at Engineered Products, when you get to the third price increase, do you actually go for the fourth price increase because the fact of the matter is, you run the risk of demand destruction in the short-term, and that's not good. So part of my comment about Engineered Products, especially around ESG and VSG is at a certain point if we go negative in terms of price cost, but the volume remains robust and the installed base goes up, that's a better trade because we believe that some of these supply chain constraints and raw materials will roll off hopefully sooner than later. And you know what, do you really go back to your core customers and say sorry, but here comes another price increase. So I think that we're managing differently across the portfolio, but we don't want to force short-term demand destruction by trying to just be draconian. Andrew. I don't know how to answer that. I -- look well, I'll put it in this way, Andrew, where we realistically looking at right now is about two-thirds of our dry powder. Now do we execute on that or not, I'm not sure, but I just in terms of the amount of targets and a realistic view of what the value of those targets are is about two-thirds of our dry powder. So it's quite a bit at the end of the day. But it's a realistic view and there are some deals that we just can't get there. I mean, this notion that return on invested capital made a quantum leap from three years to five years over the last 12 months, I find an interesting dynamic. And I'm not here to criticize anybody's deals, everybody has got their own strategy to a certain extent. So my -- like I said before to Jeff's question, the bad news is valuation, the good news is there's a lot of assets that see valuations of transactions in the marketplace. So the amount of opportunities that are out there and ones that are rumored to come is actually proactive to capital deployment. The price to raw materials improves in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. The outlier is logistics costs and line stoppages, which is really the negative headwind, but priced cost on a raw material side, it's actually better in the second half than the first half. Thanks. Hi, Scott. Well, I mean, there's really two dynamics. I think that our lead times are disappointing to our customers, because you go for years where you can convert orders within with intra-month in some of our businesses where that's just not possible. And that -- and that's where you get this function of now everybody seen it for six months and so it's got a knock-on effect of backlogs because there is a recognition of this is -- this -- this is more durable than maybe everybody thought. So the positive is it builds your backlogs at the end of the day, the negative is our lead times have stretched out. Now, you couple that with in certain of our businesses where we've had some pretty difficult logistics constraints and in some cases labor availability and then you've got disappointment of we say we're going to deliver the product on X date and we miss it and that's happened. So we can quant -- we quantify it more in dollars and cents. I'd have to go look up in terms of on-time delivery. I think across the board, it's probably okay, but there is, as I mentioned before, a business like VSG that's got probably our longest extended supply chain is suffering the most as opposed to Printing and ID that just doesn't have to deal with the reality of that. No, I think that -- I think that's a fair comment. I guess that's all I can say about that, but you're right, right, valuations inbound and outbound are what they are and you can manage that both ways. Thanks. Yes, I think that if you overlay the, my comments on to the slide, they're going to match, right. I think that we're just giving you an honest assessment based on the prevailing market conditions of where we have headwinds operationally, price cost and then some commentary on mix, which is a commentary H1 to H2. So as I mentioned in my comments, I don't think we have to be overly dramatic about it. We've managed it quite well in -- in the first half and I don't expect us to manage it differently in the second half, but we have to recognize that there are certain decisions that we're making, like if you look at DEP in terms of price cost which whether from an absolute profit point of view may be in good shape with slightly dilutive margins because we're just making a choice to chase the -- to chase the volume, which I think is appropriate in that case. Well, I mean, I think that '20 we can just throw out, right. I mean, at the end of the day everybody reacted to the change in market conditions appropriately. So, like as a percent of revenue and we'll see where we end up and I don't want to do the calculations here, but as a percent of revenue, '19 to '21 is probably flattish and I would expect that to be the same going into '22. I mean, we -- one of these days we're going to do a presentation on our returns for organic investment and they absolutely blow away anything that we do inorganically. So to the extent that we find the projects going into '22, we'll spend it internally, but right now sitting here today, do I expect as a percent of our revenue to go up dramatically in '22, no. Well, you know, I think that there is an interesting argument and I would agree with it that to the extent that labor inflation is durable and that supply chains, the issues that we're having supply chains will improve, but not dramatically. There is an argument to be made that the returns on automation are going to be better than they've been over the last five years to six years, and I would agree with that. Thanks, Joe. Yes, I think that we're just trying to be transparent, Joe, right. It's very -- we could have put up the second quarter results and said everything is great and see at next quarter and then gotten away with it, but I think that we have to recognize that there are some issues that need to be overcome. To us, I don't think that we should get overly excited about it. It's just the facts are the facts we've dealt with them in H1, if anything, it becomes more of a mix issue in Q2 and that's not problematic. So as I mentioned before, DRFE is going to have its best quarter of the year from a revenue and an operating margin point of view. So that's great in terms of absolute profit, but it is dilutive to overall Group margins. So am I going to tell them to slow down to protect the margin, no at the end of the day. And that's the case -- and there's a couple of other, a couple of our businesses. I mean, if Precision Components on the back half revenue increases, but it's slightly dilutive to a, let's call it a very robust margin that we're clocking at Pumps and Process Solutions, again, I don't think it's overly problematic, but we're just trying to guide everybody of a look at the margin in Q2, but from a seasonality point of view, if I go back and look in history, Q3 is X percent higher than Q2. So let me just model that and run down the field. I think that would -- would give you a number that we would like to get to, but I'm not entirely sure just because of the pull-forward in terms of the demand and the operating leverage that we're getting in Q2. Similar, I guess is the answer. Next quarter, I'm going to look at slides. All right, go ahead. Well, I think Brad addressed it in an earlier question. Everybody -- we don't do our pricing on January 1st, right. It's done differently. There's signaling effect to manage backlogs. So you basically in certain businesses will say, we're going to do a price increase at the end of Q1, meaning so you lose that clocking period in Q1. So it actually ramps over the balance of the year on the comp. So again it is just a reflection of the timing of those price increases and the age kind of the H1, H2 effect of that. We see -- I think I've tried to answer this about 15 different ways. I think that, that backlogs are building which is a reflection of constraints in the system. So I think when we get to next year, it's going to be an interesting dynamic because as those constraints come down, then lead times are going to come down, which is going to be negative to backlogs to a certain extent. But that I think that Steve asked the question or maybe wrote it earlier today, I think we're going to get -- we got to be careful with absolute backlogs and doing math on it and trying to extrapolate revenues into the future. I mean, the bottom line is that backlogs build and shrink based on lead times and market conditions and everything else. So could I envision a scenario where backlogs come down, yes. Do I think that's overly problematic, no, because to a certain extent, that means the headwinds that we have on supply chain logistics are getting better, which is better for margins at the end of the day. Yes, well, look, I mean I think that we are executing really, really well in Pumps & Process Solutions. I mean we made a presentation on that on what we thought was coming at the end of '20. And look and as I mentioned at the end of Q1, we think that we are in at minimum a three-year cycle of the demand function on DRFE which is positive. And it's not just -- it's across the board, it's not just door cases, it's systems business, it's SWEP on the heat exchangers and it's Belvac, all of which we believe are in a multi-year cycle. Thanks. Good morning. Hope boy, well, we've got a pretty wide portfolio, I'll make some general comments about the components. They're all tied. They are more problematic if they're large and imported, because if you take a look at what's going on when the logistics supply chain in the Port of Los Angeles and all that, it is a bloody mess right now, which only impacts a small portion of our portfolio, because as I mentioned in my comments at the end of the day, we think that we are winning in the marketplace because we don't have a lot of instances of that. If you've got very long supply chains and it's containerized freight coming out of Asia back to North America to fulfill demand, you are suffering quite frankly. On the labor side, it's purely in our operations that I have a higher propensity of assembly labor, and for all the reasons that we can understand that's been difficult. I think it's not getting worse as we move through the second quarter, which is a good news. So, hopefully in September, when some of these government influence in terms of the labor market begins to roll off that it will get better and everybody is going to go back to school in September. So our view right now is it's probably going to remain difficult through August, and I think that we're hopeful in September that the situation is fine. I mean, if the demand holds up then we'll continue to kind of given that latitude because the absolute profit versus the carrying cost of the working capital, the math works, I guess the best way I can say it. I would expect if we get improvement in the logistics supply chain that it will come down naturally, because that's what's really driving it at the end of the day. We're basically given the green light to everybody of, you've got the backlog, don't be reticent of trying to get the sub components in because we want to convert. Thanks."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrey Galiuk: Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available for playback through May 4 and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months.  Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website.  We want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to uncertainties and risks, including the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers, suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity and cash flow. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the first quarter for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.  With that, I will turn this call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thank you, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. We have a big group this morning. So we're going to have a robust Q&A session.  So, let's move to page three. The business challenge moving into Q1 was twofold for Dover. First, we exited 2020 with a healthy backlog of business which we needed to operationally deliver against. Back end, we had to work closely with our distributors and customers to seize opportunities in the marketplace despite a complex set of challenges with raw materials, components, logistics and labor availability. We are pleased with our first quarter performance on both counts, which is reflected in our robust revenue growth and the increase in our order backlog as we move into Q2.  Let's take a look at the metrics. Total revenue is up 13%, 9% organic to the comparable period. Clearly, the quarter benefited from a good order, backlog position and the willingness of the channels to receive product deliveries as market demand accelerated, resulting in the highest volume quarter since 2014 and the largest first quarter volume since 2012 for the company.  This performance is a clear indication that our product portfolio is attractive and often underappreciated growth avenues and that the work that we have done on operational excellence is gaining traction.  Order rates outpaced revenue in the quarter, posting bookings of $2.3 billion, a 27% comparable organic increase. The growth was broad based with all five segments contributing to the increase. This resulted in the seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion, an increase of 39%.  Since our earnings are issued among the first in the industrial sector, I suppose it's on us to explain the drivers of growth and their impact on seasonality and full-year demand. I'm going to try to be careful with my choice of terms and comments not to cast unwarranted shade on a clearly positive market demand environment.  There are several factors driving healthy customer activity, including pent up demand from last year as a result of low starting channel inventories in certain sectors. As I also mentioned in my opening remarks, this was further influenced by tight supply chains and materials inflation, positively contributing to seasonal demand and backlog build as our customers and channels positioned themselves to meet their forecasted demand.  Importantly, before we get all wound up trying to quantify the impact of channel inventory stocking and inflationary prebuy and how it impacts quarterly demand, let's not lose sight of the fact that total marketplace demand is robust, which is reflected on our backlog and which also leads us to revise our revenue growth guidance upward for the full year to 10% to 12%. So put succinctly, it's not prebuy if we don't remove it from the full year revenue estimates.  Still early in the year and we will continue to produce to meet customer demands and watch our backlog and order patterns. We'll have more color on the drivers of demand, and our revenue performance, including contribution of market share gains as we progress through the year.  For now, we are focused on executing operationally in demanding conditions to win in the marketplace. But we clearly believe that favorable demand conditions remain durable through the year.  Let's move to profitability. Q1 was solid with consolidated adjusted segment margin at 19.1%, 320 basis points higher versus the comparable quarter. This was supported by strong volumes, favorable mix of products delivered, positive price [technical difficulty] continued operational discipline and efficiency initiatives, which more than offset input cost headwinds.  Strong profitability and continued focus on working capital management resulted in seasonally strong free cash flow, which was up $110 million compared to last year's first quarter or the comparable period.  With a solid Q1 under our belt, we look at the remainder of 2020 with constructive optimism. Strong order trends and a record backlog portend a robust top line outlook and we have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges.  With that, we are raising our guidance for the year to 10% to 12%, all-in revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, a substantial step up compared to our prior guidance.  I will skip slide 4 which provides a more detailed overview of our results for the first quarter. So, let's move to slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 2% organically as demand conditions improved modestly [technical difficulty] comparable period. Vehicle services entered the year with a strong order book and faced solid demand across all geographies and product lines. Industrial automation grew on automotive recovery and channel restocking and aerospace and defense shipments were solid. The business remains booked well into the second half of the year.  As expected, waste hauling was down year-over-year, given a lower starting backlog entering Q1, which was further impacted by component availability issues that constrain shipments in the quarter. We have forecasted this business to be levered towards H2 and order trends and backlog reflect that. Same dynamic for industrial winches, with revenue down in the quarter, but recovery in order rates. We expect a continued gradual recovery in this business over the year.  Margin performance in the quarter was flat year-over-year as volume leverage and pricing offset the negative fixed cost absorption in the capital goods portion of the portfolio. And Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on the strength of North American retail fueling as well as our software and systems business. Activity in China remained subdued. Order backlogs are up 13% and we expect our hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance driven underground product offerings to contribute positively due to an increase in miles driven and construction seasonality as we make our way through the year.  The segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on higher volumes, productivity actions and mix, which is a continuation of the trajectory that we exited in 2020.  Sales in Imaging & Identification improved 4% organically, the core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer and services demand in North America and Asia, and was partially offset by a decline in consumables against the comparable quarter where customers stocked up on inks at the onset of the pandemic.  We also saw a nice pickup in serialization software sales. Textile printer sales remain soft as global apparel and retail remains impacted by COVID. Ink consumable volumes were up as we significantly improved ink attachment rates and we saw encouraging improvement in the pipeline and new printer sales as the quarter progressed.  Margins improved slightly in the segment on higher volumes and we were able to offset material cost inflation with strategic pricing during the quarter.  Pumps & Process Solutions posted 18% organic growth in the quarter on improved volumes across all businesses except precision components. Order rates and shipments for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong. Industrial pumps had a solid quarter, driven by improved end market conditions and distributor demand. And polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year on robust demand in Asia and the US.  Precision components was down in the quarter though demand conditions stabilized in hydrodynamic bearings and compression parts, as well as broadly in China through new OEM builds remains impacted.  Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded by 890 basis points on strong volume, favorable mix and pricing. This team has moved this segment to best in class top line and bottom line metrics through a dedication to operational excellence, robust product development, and innovation management, and proactive and purposeful inorganic actions. It's a world class collection of assets that we will continue to invest behind.  Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its solid momentum from the second half of last year, posting 18% organic growth. Revenue on new orders in beverage can making more than doubled year-over-year. Food retail saw broad-based increases across its product lines as key retailers resumed capital investment in product programs, plus we've seen good demand for some of our new product introductions and customer wins. Our natural refrigerant systems business in particular experienced robust demand in Europe and the US as customers are adopting more environmentally friendly solutions. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in Asia and Europe across all end markets. Foodservice equipment was down in the quarter, but saw a stabilization in chain restaurant demand.  Despite operational challenges in food retail due to availability issues with insulation raw materials, adjusted margin performance improved by 450 basis points, supported by stronger volumes, productivity initiatives and cost actions we took in the middle of 2020, partially offset by input cost inflation.  I'll pass it to Brad from here. \nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 6. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our top line benefited from organic growth across all five segments, with particular strength in Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments.  FX benefited top line by 3% or $51 million. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $15 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters.  The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our three largest geographic regions. The US, our largest market, posted 7% organic growth in the quarter on solid order rates and retail fueling, marking, coating, biopharma connectors, food retail and can making among others, and was partially offset by delayed shipments and waste hauling.  Europe grew by 13% in the quarter on strong shipments and vehicle aftermarket, biopharma, industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia returned to growth and was up 20% organically, driven by China, which was up 60% against the COVID impacted comparable quarter in the prior year.  Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 27% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum we are seeing across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic bookings growth across all five segments. Overall, our backlog is currently up $626 million or 39% versus this time last year, positioning us well for the remainder of the year.  Let's go to the earnings bridges on slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted segment. EBIT was up nearly $100 million and margin improved several 100 basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. Going through the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $60 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes, as well as higher corporate expenses, primarily related to compensation accruals and deal expenses.  The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $6 million in the quarter or approximately $3 million lower than in 2020. Right-sizing and other costs were $4 million in the quarter or $3 million after tax.  Now on slide 8. We were pleased with the cash flow performance in the first quarter with free cash flow of $146 million or $110 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 8% of revenue in the first quarter, which is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of our production. Let me turn it back to Rich. \nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Brad. Let's go to slide [technical difficulty]. We expect demand in Engineered Products to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year, which is supported by a robust backlog. We continue to see strong bookings trends in vehicle services and industrial automation. Aerospace and defense have significant revenue visibility through its government programs and is booked well into the second half of the year.  Order rates on waste handling improved significantly during the first quarter, though the shipment schedule will be levered towards the second half and we're watching the supply chain here closely, which is a stabilizer we expect a gradual recovery through the second half of the year.  As communicated on our investor meeting in November, we expect Fueling Solutions to post moderate organic growth for the year. There was a known headwind from EMB roll off in the US, but order trends support a number of positives offsetting it, including growth in systems and software, recovery in underground businesses and growth in vehicle wash. We also expect that Asia, China in particular, should stabilize and become a net positive for us in the second half. The ICS acquisition which we closed at the end of last year is off to a very good start as vehicle wash market is recovering healthily.  Imaging & ID is expected to perform well this year. Our core marking and coating business, stalwarts in 2020, is expected to continue to deliver low to mid-single digit growth with services and serialization products positively impacting performance.  Digital textile printing remains slow, although we saw a year-over-year improvement in ink tonnage sales in Q1 as we continue executing our strategy to attach consumables to machine sales. We expect recovery here in the second half.  Pumps & Process Solutions should have another solid year. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remains robust and trading conditions in industrial pumps rebounded quickly in the first quarter, and momentum should continue. Our recent investments in biopharma capacity were prescient, and we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on the secular growth story.  Plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance as a global shortage of plastic and rubber as well as petrochemical investments are driving increased investment in processing plants. Precision components have stabilized and we expect it to contribute to year-over-year growth again in the second half of the year.  With its large backlog and high order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to have a strong year. New orders in the core food retail businesses have been healthy in the last few quarters as retailers that had paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic are restarting these strategic initiatives.  Additionally, we are capitalizing on our leadership position in natural refrigerant systems both in Europe and also in the US, where we believe the recent mandate in California will foretell a trend among the other 49 states to mandate the transition to more environmentally friendly solutions. We also see good growth in our specialty product line and small format customers segment.  Belvac continues to work through a record backlog and had another significant bookings quarter in Q1. They are booked for the year. Our heat exchanger business is seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We are investing in capacity and new capabilities in these two businesses and are well positioned to capture growth.  Demand is stabilized in food service equipment at restaurant chains and we expect the institutional business to recover in the second half as students return to schools and traffic improves at stadiums and hotels. Our revised annual guidance is on page 10. We covered the most pertinent of these items [technical difficulty] and we summarized them here for your reference.  Finally, slide 11 puts expected 2021 performance in a multi-year perspective. Our 2019 investor presentation, we highlighted how the changes to Dover's portfolio over the prior decade shaped a less cyclical business and provided attractive through cycle returns. 2020 was proof of lower top line cyclicality in a demanding environment and our ability to protect profitability.  Operational excellence and operating margin expansion has been our priority over the last couple of years and we are on track to deliver more than 100 basis points of average margin expansion over that period. And we have the playbook and tools for this to continue.  Dover is positioned to deliver attractive double-digit EPS growth, in line with our long-term corporate targets communicated in 2019.  Before wrapping up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their hard work delivering these results and their continued perseverance.  And that's the end of the presentation. So, Andrey, we can open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan.\nSteve Tusa: Rich, this is the most excited I've heard you in a while. Way to jump out of your shoes there. The kind of rest of the year guidance, I just wanted to kind of get an idea of \u2013 you mentioned there, these kind of like \u2013 I think they were bookings tailwinds this quarter, but not necessarily revenue tailwinds. But when I look at kind of the rest of the year and I just kind of simply divide the rest of the year guide to quarterly just to get to a quarterly number, and keeping in mind the first quarter is usually like a pretty low number seasonally, it seems like sequentially to the rest of the year quarterly that you have EPS, EBIT kind of softening and actually down sequentially and sales basically kind of flattish for the rest of the year just on a quarterly \u2013 kind of simple quarterly divided by three, rest of the year divided by three. So, is there something like a fundamental that will drop off other than EMB? You'd mentioned a lot of these businesses have a second half that actually looks pretty good. Anything we're missing on this one? \nRichard Tobin: No. Look, at the end of the day, Q1 was stronger than we expected. So, I think that we're quite pleased in our ability to pivot operationally to get the product out the door. I think that we're probably being arguably conservative to get another quarter under our belt to see how much of that backlog and demand is being influenced by channel restocking and trying to get in front of raw material perceived price increases in the future. And I'm not entirely clear right now how much of Q1 overperformance was taken from Q2, which is seasonally when we kind of ramp. So, it's usually a low Q1, big move in Q2, Q3 and then kind of run for cash in Q4. You just can't do the math and say, well, historically, it's been this percentage of revenue and operating profit and this is what the seasonality is, and if I take Q1 as a proxy and I run my spreadsheet, it kicks out an extraordinarily high number, both on the revenue side and the operating margin side.  So, from the revenue side, I think fair enough, we may be a little conservative. We'd like to see our bookings go through Q2. I'll tell you sitting here in April that it's not deteriorating, which is a good news. So, that portends a pretty decent Q3 that we've got coming up, but we'd like to see how that develops over time.  Because make no mistake, there's a couple of things here. Operationally, it is getting kind of difficult out there in terms of sourcing raw materials, labor availability, a variety of different things out there. We had some headwinds in the first quarter, but I'll tell you that operationally, we plowed through. We're not out of the woods yet. Right now, we missed shipments in both ESG and in retail refrigeration because of component availability. I don't really know yet whether that's going to get better or worse.  My final comment, and I know this is a long answer, but you're at the head of the line and this is going to be the question we knew we were going to get, is from a margin point of view, and I think that I discussed this at the end of 2020, the incremental margin expectation for Q2, because the comp is so good, has been overstated on margin because of our ability to use furlough mechanisms that were subsidized by the government, meaning we can take production people off of our payroll because we had subsidies in place to account for it. So, you actually have a snap back of costs. Now, we're in pretty good shape because our revenue is up so much, so we should be able to absorb it. But I think, by and large, what I've seen that there's an expectation in industrial world where the incremental in Q2 margin performance is a lot higher than we would expect.  The second answer on the margin performance in the balance of the year is we really expect to accelerate in refrigeration over the balance of the year. So, we've got this big backlog. It's up to us to get it out. So, out of the growth that we expect in the balance of the year, a lot more of that growth is going to \u2013 from refrigeration than it was in Q1. And as you know, that is dilutive to margins as they go forward. So, I would caution you not to take Q1 incremental margins and just multiply it by three.\nSteve Tusa: One last question. Q2 EPS, will they actually grow sequentially? \nRichard Tobin: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Without question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Rich, maybe following up on margin. You've been asked before about achieving a 20% adjusted segment operating margin many times. You did just record over 19%. Obviously, a strong quarter there. And we know one quarter doesn't dictate a trend. But is 20% as a long-term target, maybe too low at this point, given how well you're operating in the businesses?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I didn't expect that one today, Andy. Look, I'll put it this way. We're pleased with the operational performance and we're pleased with the mix impact on the operating margin, clearly reaching 19% at the segment level in Q1 of 2021. The 20%, I guess, is earlier in reach than even we had been modeling it in the past. Now, that is going to be \u2013 I'm not going to do this big mix discussion again. I guess over the balance of the year \u2013 so number one, the answer is we're going to get to 20% earlier than we thought based on current trajectory. So, what that means \u2013 I'm not putting a target out there yet. We'll give you one maybe in Q3.  What we are going to fight against between now and the end of the year, we've discussed the mix impact of margins, is inflationary input costs between raw materials, labor, and price costs. As we discussed, at the end of 2020, we were on the front foot in terms of getting price out there. Think about it in terms of inventory change, the inflation on the raw materials was not in our inventory. So, you get positive price cost early in the transition as long as you stay on the front foot. Now, we're going to be really closely watching price cost over the balance of the year in terms of net realization. So, we would have expected to get the biggest benefit in Q1. By and large, that's where we expect it. The way it's looking, we may have to intervene on price, again, in certain of the businesses over the balance of the year. And that will impact the margin performance.  So, yeah, look, 2020 when we put the target out there was 400 basis points improvement, I think, from the time period we put it out there. Clearly, I think we'll be revisiting those longer-term targets sometime this year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Just following up on he sort of the confidence level in DRFE in the sense that you've got now a couple quarters of revenue and backlog. I did notice you talked about increasing capacity at Belvac in heat exchangers. So, you've said before, Rich, that it could be a multi-year cycle in this business. Does the confidence level go up around that sort of comment in the past? Do you see potential for double-digit growth, mid-teens margins? Is the confidence level around that higher now?\nRichard Tobin: Well, it's getting higher with every passing month of the backlog build. So if you go back and look at the comments, refrigeration gets a lot of the color, it's the biggest piece of the segment, their backlog continued to build. That's the one that we said that we're relatively confident that we're in kind of a secular growth period for, we would say, 36 months [indiscernible] see it. I think it's been augmented now by transition to CO2 which should be somewhat of a tailwind that we didn't really recognize maybe even six months ago. So I think that's helpful. And how long the transition from expanding capacity in can making and the transition from PEP to aluminum, how long that goes, remains to be seen. As Brad mentioned I think in his comments, we're booking well into 2022 now.  On the heat exchanger side, I think that we are outgrowing the market quite frankly. I think that we've got some unique positioning, especially in heat pumps. We are expanding capacity now. So, based on new product launches and expanded capacity, I think that we can outgrow the market. But generally speaking, that's a low-single digit growing market over time. We'd like to see if we can push through and kind of outperform. \nOperator: Your next question comes from one of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: On the supply chain stuff, it doesn't sound like it's the stuff that's front and center in everybody's mind, i.e. semiconductors. It sounds like it might be kind of more basic sort of stuff. Could you actually elaborate a little bit on the on the types of pressures you're seeing and how widespread they are?\nRichard Tobin: I think we have some exposure on electronic components. It's not huge, but it does impact a few of our businesses. And that is more not chip bait. That is logistics supply chain based. So, you can go take a look at what's going on in the Port of Los Angeles right now. I'm hoping that that will unbuckle now that COVID seems to be passing. But a lot of that is just moving the materials that are sourced out of Asia.  But the whole freight logistics chain is kind of \u2013 I guess it's tight right now. And it's tight. And it's reflected in the logistics costs that we've had to bear. And it's tight in terms of getting the deliveries we want.  But then, like anything else at Dover, becomes very anecdotal because we're not vertically integrated industrial, making one product. So, we've had issues with hydraulic components in ESG. We'd have issue with lighting systems in refrigeration. So, there's a laundry list of things. But for the most part, it's, let's call it, supply chain logistics constraints that are impacting us.\nJeff Sprague: Pump & Process margins did look, I guess I could say, awesome. I would assume there's an unusually rich mix in the quarter. But maybe you could just provide a little bit of color on what you think kind of normalized margin rates are in that business?\nRichard Tobin: It is a very good mix in the quarter. We made that presentation last year about our biopharma and single use pumps business. I kind of tried to give everybody idea what that business was capable of delivering at. So, that was a business because of its capacity utilization is running \u2013 is converting at gross margin level right now, which is very healthy. We're watching it closely. Right now, it is actually a short cycle business. We're trying to build our backlog, but we really don't have a lot of visibility. So I think that we're being prudent in terms of our second half estimates, in terms of how long that goes.  On the industrial pump side, it's actually been quite robust also, but that's more channel inventory. Interestingly, we had a very good performance in China in the pump business in Q1, and it's been some time since we've seen that, and the margins were quite healthy. And you have to recall that the management had been very proactive in taking costs out in 2020. And so, we have the roll forward benefit on the industrial pump side on the margin moving into 2021. So, that was quite healthy. I think on pumps and polymers, this is a business that I think that the management team has effectively doubled the margin in the last three years. So, gross margins in that business are healthy again.  So, overall, what's going to impact the margin the most is going to be mix. Even when precision components does come back in the second half, it's not overtly dilutive to it. Slightly so. The bigger issue is going to be how does demand hold up on single use pumps in the second half of the year?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just a first question around just the organic sales outlook. So, heard you loud and clear on the RFP getting better as you go through the year. I just wondered if you could revisit perhaps the organic growth outlook by segment. You gave numbers on the Q4 call for each one. Just wondered in the context of your higher organic growth guide, it looks like about two points maybe firm-wide, which were the divisions that really led that organic growth increase for the company overall?\nRichard Tobin: Let's start at the top. If our capital goods businesses return in the second half, as we would expect, that would meet our original forecasts, I think it's \u2013 vehicle services group looks to be poised to get a \u2013 probably a full point of organic growth that we did not expect at the beginning of the year.  The printing and ID business is performing as expected. Clearly, the upside is if textile comes back in a robust fashion in the second half. Right now, we don't have the backlog that would support that thesis. But if it turns, we'll probably have a lot more color on that one at the end of the second quarter.  DFS looks like it may have a point, if not two. One of those points is based on the acquisitions that we've made. So, you get a point of growth there. When that rolls into organic or not, I have to look in the calendarization of blah, blah, blah. But just in terms of total, that's why we gave out total growth early on here and didn't try to parse it between organic and inorganic, but we may get a point of growth. We'd like to take a real close look on OPW or the undergrad portion of it and see how it develops on hanging hardware. But we'd expect that to get better over the year, offsetting what's likely to be the negative EMB headwind that we have on the above ground side in the second half. I answered Jeff Sprague's question about Pumps & Process Solutions. So I've gone through that one.  And look, our backlog in DRFE, Belvac adding to its backlog doesn't do anything with the revenue. They're going to pause, it's purely execution now, how much of that backlog they can realize. And we just expanded capacity there to help them do it. I think the outlier is going to be refrigeration. So, we've got a real robust backlog. That is a short cycle business. So, we don't have \u2013 I think we may be eating into the beginning of Q3 right now in terms of orders. So we don't have anything for Q4. I think we probably need another quarter to kind of get that tightened down.\nJulian Mitchell: Definitely, the operating margin, you sound very confident in that 30-percent-ish conversion range off a higher sales number. The free cash flow margin guide is similar to before, higher free cash flow, I suppose in dollars because of the revenue guide increase. The capex guide is unchanged. So, you're just kind of dialing in, maybe \u2013 look, it's a very complicated operating environment that may put some extra strain on working capital over next six months. Maybe just help us understand what impacts we see in the cash flow from these constraints on components and so forth? Not so much the P&L.\nRichard Tobin: Okay, a couple of things. We are giving latitude to our businesses to build working capital to compete for market share at this point, number one. And number two, I think that we mentioned, at the end of the year, we've given some latitude on working capital to prebuy their own raw materials to get in front of what we expect it to be inflationary environment.  The fact of the matter is, in Q1, the performance is based on a couple things. Number one, we did not \u2013 our payables balance exiting 2020 was not as high as it had been in previous quarters. So, there wasn't a snap back in terms of making those payables in Q1 that we've seen in the past. And quite frankly, our conversion or velocity of working capital in Q1, because the revenue was what it was, was a lot higher than we would normally see. So, look, [indiscernible] hit your nail on the head. In absolute terms, if we're guiding the revenue up and the margin looks like it's proactive, then in absolute dollars, then free cash flow should move at the same. We're working really hard on it. And I think that we probably like a quarter or two can revisit the metric as a percent of revenue. But for right now, I think we're confident that absolute dollar cash flow would be quite healthy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Just a follow-up question on sustainability of margin in Pumps & Process Solutions? Do you guys have a sense on dynamic between, particularly in biopharma, between the base business, diagnostics, and other COVID related stuff? Just sort of thinking, if you look at life science companies, right, some companies are more exposed to tests. So, those may turn negative next year. But then other companies say, hey, going into 2022, there's enough base year building that it's going to be sort of sustainable growth into 2022. So how should we think about that business?\nRichard Tobin: Well, you basically have the Q&A that we give to the person that runs that business for us, and we try to unpack that. The only recent data that we do have is that development for follow-on vaccines looks like it's quite robust, number one, and that there was a view at some point that you are going to move from skid development to much larger incubators over time and that transition is negative to single use and we don't see it right now. Now, does that change between now and the end of the year? Our view? I'm sure it will change every quarter as we work through it. And that's why we're being a bit cautious in terms of the duration of the demand that we have in that particular sector. Because if it goes to large incubation, then the volume or the demand, this is a business that's been growing in the high teens for 24 months now. When that begins to roll over, right now we don't see it. I can tell you that right now, we're expanding at capacity again in the case that it's durable. But it's hard to say right now.\nAndrew Obin: Just sort of thinking about refrigeration. This sort of, A, what I'm trying to get at sort of thinking about normalized margins for refrigeration. When do you think we will hit normalized volumes? And how should we think about incrementals in refrigeration? You did say it's going to be negative for the mix. But given all the restructuring, could these guys have high incrementals and corporate average for the rest of the year? So, two questions.\nRichard Tobin: I don't know. I'd have to go do the sums for corporate average, but our expectation that they will be a larger contributor to year-over-year profits in at minimum Q2 and Q3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch: Rich, I'm wondering if we could just maybe provide a little bit more context around your strategic pricing, whatever you'd like to offer. So, sort of what businesses \u2013 are you raising prices? What businesses do you still have to raise prices for? And what's the channel reception? Is everybody else doing it too? And just any kind of context you could provide us? Is this also going to get worse as they go throughout the year? You think it's going to kind of hold where things are?\nRichard Tobin: Can I say hard to say, John? Look, we're raising prices \u2013 this all started with raw materials. So, you can go through our portfolio. Clearly, the capital goods side has got the biggest exposure to the raw materials and they were on the front foot at the beginning. And from what we can see, so far, it looks like the entire complex is following along. Now it takes 90 to 180 days to see what realization is because you get pricing out there, then you got inventory turns, and blah, blah, blah. So, that's where it started.  But the fact of the matter is, I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation. But there is inflation. And it's not just the raw materials because raw materials are in the sub-components that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly, at the assembly level, on labor, availability is becoming a problem. And that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from \u2013 it's the capital good sides that are buying a lot of raw materials. Now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business, that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year.  On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs, we ship a lot of product that's FOB. It's more inbound logistics costs than it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because \u2013 God forbid you have to air freight anything right now, it's a bit of a negative. So, we are going to be on it in terms of price costs. And it's hard for us because of the disparity of the SKUs that we have in this portfolio. It's not like we're making cars. So we're going to be on it. And it's a trailing number and we're going to have to do it as a combination of as the numbers come out and our intuition going in. But at worst, it's going to have to be a scenario of net neutral.\nJohn Inch: At worst, okay. Interestingly enough, does this provide a framework or opportunity for Dover if this tentacle of inflation or these tentacles of inflation really kind of proliferate to start to raise prices, perhaps not on so much a surgical basis? So, it's sort of implied in your answers, the channel is not really resisting. People aren't saying, excuse me, you can't raise prices in this regard, we'll go to competitor B or whatever. None of us want to see rampant inflation. But if there's mild inflation that's across the board, can Dover start to raise pricing in other areas that maybe aren't quite as affected, but still help your profitability, particularly if the channel is kind of more willing to accept because of general inflation, blah, blah, blah?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I guess the answer is yes. But let me give you an example. We have raised prices in refrigeration and lost volume because of it. Because we're more interested in that particular business to raising the operating margin. And as a material component of the market structure, it's up to us to lead the market and stop complaining about the fact that there's no pricing power in it. So, that's an example there.  We've got certain other businesses where our gross margins are significantly higher. And there, we may waive it off because if we've got an opportunity to grab share, now's the time to do it. So, we don't manage the portfolio and giving a \u2013 here's the three bullet points and everybody go execute it. We do it based on market structure, competitive environment, and a variety of other things. So, it's a combination of a variety of things. Whether it's price cost, positive defaults to the bottom line, or market share gains and gross margins that fall to the bottom line, we'll take it either way.\nOperator: Your next question coming from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Rich, I don't think you mentioned in your prepared remarks anything about the M&A pipeline. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel with the higher valuations that you're seeing out there or availability of assets?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I guess the good news, Scott, is that as our margins move up, we can be more expansive in terms of what the multiple was willing to pay because if we wound the clock back a couple years ago, a lot of what we looked at was trading at a much higher multiple that we're trading at and we've gone a long way of fixing it. So, yeah, we're looking at some interesting things in the pipeline. Look at the cash flow this year, is proactive. So, as I mentioned at the end of last year that we're going to make some quicker decisions probably this year in terms of capital deployment or capital return. So, yeah, I think that \u2013 look, the management team here was challenged to deliver margin accretion over time on the base portfolio. And the trade-off was, if you do so, then we're going to reinvest in your businesses. We've done that on an organic basis in a meaningful way. I think that we've got certain portions of the portfolio that have earned the right now to be a little bit more expansive inorganically. So, we're probably more on the front foot today than we've been in my tenure here.\nScott Davis: You'd mentioned, I think, at one of the conferences a couple of new automation projects that you guys are doing, I think, in vehicle and waste. But can you give us a little bit of color on those projects? And any sense of how do you cadence stuff like that into an up cycle when you're trying to manage high demand, but also you might have some downtime and such to implement projects?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah, you've got to be careful. I think that we've done a few of them here now. So I think that we're getting better at them in terms of how much inventory do we have to prebuild to accommodate for execution risk. I'm confident that I think that the two bigger ones that we have going on right now, we've got \u2013 just like we did in refrigeration \u2013 the floor space to accommodate kind of the CapEx portion of the project, to run on the installed base. So you've got a transitory period, but it's not as if you have to shut down to redo the plant and do it that way. It's kind of you build it on the side and you just open it up over time.  A lot of what else we're doing now is we're doing a lot of work on the machining centers. And that's productivity related that we're spending pretty heavily in right now. And that's some of our lower gross margin businesses. We're trying to kind of bring those up over time. And we've got some real interesting ones going on in some of our higher volume throughput businesses on inspection technology that is allowing us to increase capacity without expanding the physical footprint. And that's the one I referenced before on the biopharma side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. \nJoe Ritchie: Rich, we talked a little bit about inventory levels being low and the demand environment remaining robust. So, it's clearly like not a pull forward in demand. I'm just wondering, like, when you think about raw material availability in 1Q and some of the supply chain disruption that you saw, was there a certain amount of revenues that you couldn't book in 1Q that got pushed out into 2Q? Maybe some color around that would be helpful. \nRichard Tobin: No, overall, as a corporation, we overdeliver. I would have expected that we could have forced through the funnel. If I told you about the meetings we were having around here in early January about our Q1 forecasts, we were yelling at everybody about moving them up. And then we've got a lot of demand. And I would have expected that we would have had \u2013 we had anecdotal issues that I referenced, but the fact of the matter is, in total, we over delivered. So, what went on in Pumps & Process Solutions as a whole, their ability to get that amount of product out in an intra-quarter period where they actually didn't even have all those orders, I think, was impressive. So, we did lose some volume in ESG. We lost some volume in refrigeration. But overall, we over deliver them what I would have expected if I looked at kind of backlog conversion expectation going into the year.\nJoe Ritchie: I guess maybe just kind of following on that conversation with John on price cost. It looks like you've got about 80 basis points of price this quarter. You made some comments around \u2013 not all the costs are inflationary costs that would be in your inventory. So, I'm just curious to see whether it's discussing the price cost impact in 1Q or how you see that playing out for the rest of the year. I'm just curious to hear how you're thinking this is going to \u2013 the trajectory is going to look like going forward?\nRichard Tobin: I think that we would have expected to be positive in Q1 just because of the timing of the action that we took on pricing, which actually started in Q4 of last year. And then it gives then between what's stuck in inventory and then what is pre-announced kind of these \u2013 the price increases effective April 1 and how does that drive backlog and whether you can reprice that backlog. I think that we're vigilant about it. But bottom line is, the only way we're really going to know is over time. So, I don't know Q2 right now, whether we're going to be price cost, whether it's going to be a credit or debit. I think it's going to be a credit, right? But between announced price increases and price realization, and all of the noise around the subcomponents because you can't measure inflation and you can do it for raw materials and castings because it's kind of bulk orders and you only have a few suppliers, but you're talking about subcomponents across this portfolio, it's quite difficult to measure. So, Brad and I were discussing it this morning. It's the one thing that we've got to really keep our eyes on. And look, we'll have more color on it by the time we close Q2.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. \nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just taking a step back on kind of the recovery as a whole here, Rich, you guys are going to be back to pre-COVID levels pretty soon and certainly before year end, it looks like. Where are you seeing evidence that this is maybe a stronger recovery versus the line that you used earlier that you had some pent up demand from 2020? Like, is this a stronger cycle? Or is this sort of catch up on stuff that really should have gotten done last year?\nRichard Tobin: All of the above, Josh, I guess. Look, if we go back to 2019, we've introduced a lot of new products, believe it or not, between our 2019 base and our 2021 trajectory. We've also been, I want to say, overly active in M&A, but we did some inorganic investments from 2019 through 2021. So, those end up being topline credits. Forget what the total aggregate demand environment is.  Look, the recovery looks like it's broad based at the end of the day. There are trade-offs were, in 2019, certain geographies are stronger, and now they're weaker, but they have their own reasons why. I think that the only one that we can really point to where there's an inflection of the demand environment is refrigeration. But we talked about that, leading into 2021, where we went through a three to four year period where the capital base was under invested by big box retail and now we're going into a cycle. We're calling it a three year cycle. Let's hope it's four. And then you've got some interesting changes in in \u2013 structural changes like that are impacting things like Belvac where this transition to aluminum cans is kind of cyclical where you know that business hasn't grown in a very long time. And now it's making a pretty sweeping transition for COVID reasons and environmental reasons. So, the 2019 base is important, but we would have expected that if we rebased 2019 for new product launches and acquisitions, that base would have been higher anyway at the end of the day, if that answers your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: We've sort of beaten some of the backlog discussion to death, but maybe just one more for good measure. You mentioned that you were able to get a lot of product out the door in the first quarter. Wasn't really a lot of bottlenecks on your side. But a lot of the commentary about backlog seems kind of second half focused. Is there a point at which lead times sort of temper the order intake that folks say, hey, I'm not going to get this for a while, so I'm going to hold off and see what life is like? Or is it the inverse? Because it just seems like there's an awful lot of backlog pretty early in the year. \nRichard Tobin: It depends on the business at the end of the day and the market structure. We tend to compete in some pretty concentrated market structures where unless there's a disparity between us and an individual competitor, that's what we're competing with. I think it remains to be seen whether the distribution demand begins to \u2013 that rate of increase slows down because if it's not liquidating \u2013 it's not liquidating out of distribution inventory at the same pace that it's coming in, then, obviously, it's going to slow down. It's a bit too early to tell, quite frankly. So, the long lead time items where markets are concentrated, I don't think it's going to have a negative impact on the short cycle side. What we're trying to do on the short cycle side is forcefully build the backlog because generally speaking, the bigger backlog that we are, the more efficient we are as producers, but that is going to be tied up on the competitive environment and product availability and everything else. So we'll see. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 6. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our top line benefited from organic growth across all five segments, with particular strength in Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments.  FX benefited top line by 3% or $51 million. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $15 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters.  The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our three largest geographic regions. The US, our largest market, posted 7% organic growth in the quarter on solid order rates and retail fueling, marking, coating, biopharma connectors, food retail and can making among others, and was partially offset by delayed shipments and waste hauling.  Europe grew by 13% in the quarter on strong shipments and vehicle aftermarket, biopharma, industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia returned to growth and was up 20% organically, driven by China, which was up 60% against the COVID impacted comparable quarter in the prior year.  Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 27% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum we are seeing across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic bookings growth across all five segments. Overall, our backlog is currently up $626 million or 39% versus this time last year, positioning us well for the remainder of the year.  Let's go to the earnings bridges on slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted segment. EBIT was up nearly $100 million and margin improved several 100 basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. Going through the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $60 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes, as well as higher corporate expenses, primarily related to compensation accruals and deal expenses.  The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $6 million in the quarter or approximately $3 million lower than in 2020. Right-sizing and other costs were $4 million in the quarter or $3 million after tax.  Now on slide 8. We were pleased with the cash flow performance in the first quarter with free cash flow of $146 million or $110 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 8% of revenue in the first quarter, which is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of our production. Let me turn it back to Rich."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. We have a big group this morning. So we're going to have a robust Q&A session.  So, let's move to page three. The business challenge moving into Q1 was twofold for Dover. First, we exited 2020 with a healthy backlog of business which we needed to operationally deliver against. Back end, we had to work closely with our distributors and customers to seize opportunities in the marketplace despite a complex set of challenges with raw materials, components, logistics and labor availability. We are pleased with our first quarter performance on both counts, which is reflected in our robust revenue growth and the increase in our order backlog as we move into Q2.  Let's take a look at the metrics. Total revenue is up 13%, 9% organic to the comparable period. Clearly, the quarter benefited from a good order, backlog position and the willingness of the channels to receive product deliveries as market demand accelerated, resulting in the highest volume quarter since 2014 and the largest first quarter volume since 2012 for the company.  This performance is a clear indication that our product portfolio is attractive and often underappreciated growth avenues and that the work that we have done on operational excellence is gaining traction.  Order rates outpaced revenue in the quarter, posting bookings of $2.3 billion, a 27% comparable organic increase. The growth was broad based with all five segments contributing to the increase. This resulted in the seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion, an increase of 39%.  Since our earnings are issued among the first in the industrial sector, I suppose it's on us to explain the drivers of growth and their impact on seasonality and full-year demand. I'm going to try to be careful with my choice of terms and comments not to cast unwarranted shade on a clearly positive market demand environment.  There are several factors driving healthy customer activity, including pent up demand from last year as a result of low starting channel inventories in certain sectors. As I also mentioned in my opening remarks, this was further influenced by tight supply chains and materials inflation, positively contributing to seasonal demand and backlog build as our customers and channels positioned themselves to meet their forecasted demand.  Importantly, before we get all wound up trying to quantify the impact of channel inventory stocking and inflationary prebuy and how it impacts quarterly demand, let's not lose sight of the fact that total marketplace demand is robust, which is reflected on our backlog and which also leads us to revise our revenue growth guidance upward for the full year to 10% to 12%. So put succinctly, it's not prebuy if we don't remove it from the full year revenue estimates.  Still early in the year and we will continue to produce to meet customer demands and watch our backlog and order patterns. We'll have more color on the drivers of demand, and our revenue performance, including contribution of market share gains as we progress through the year.  For now, we are focused on executing operationally in demanding conditions to win in the marketplace. But we clearly believe that favorable demand conditions remain durable through the year.  Let's move to profitability. Q1 was solid with consolidated adjusted segment margin at 19.1%, 320 basis points higher versus the comparable quarter. This was supported by strong volumes, favorable mix of products delivered, positive price [technical difficulty] continued operational discipline and efficiency initiatives, which more than offset input cost headwinds.  Strong profitability and continued focus on working capital management resulted in seasonally strong free cash flow, which was up $110 million compared to last year's first quarter or the comparable period.  With a solid Q1 under our belt, we look at the remainder of 2020 with constructive optimism. Strong order trends and a record backlog portend a robust top line outlook and we have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges.  With that, we are raising our guidance for the year to 10% to 12%, all-in revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, a substantial step up compared to our prior guidance.  I will skip slide 4 which provides a more detailed overview of our results for the first quarter. So, let's move to slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 2% organically as demand conditions improved modestly [technical difficulty] comparable period. Vehicle services entered the year with a strong order book and faced solid demand across all geographies and product lines. Industrial automation grew on automotive recovery and channel restocking and aerospace and defense shipments were solid. The business remains booked well into the second half of the year.  As expected, waste hauling was down year-over-year, given a lower starting backlog entering Q1, which was further impacted by component availability issues that constrain shipments in the quarter. We have forecasted this business to be levered towards H2 and order trends and backlog reflect that. Same dynamic for industrial winches, with revenue down in the quarter, but recovery in order rates. We expect a continued gradual recovery in this business over the year.  Margin performance in the quarter was flat year-over-year as volume leverage and pricing offset the negative fixed cost absorption in the capital goods portion of the portfolio. And Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on the strength of North American retail fueling as well as our software and systems business. Activity in China remained subdued. Order backlogs are up 13% and we expect our hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance driven underground product offerings to contribute positively due to an increase in miles driven and construction seasonality as we make our way through the year.  The segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on higher volumes, productivity actions and mix, which is a continuation of the trajectory that we exited in 2020.  Sales in Imaging & Identification improved 4% organically, the core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer and services demand in North America and Asia, and was partially offset by a decline in consumables against the comparable quarter where customers stocked up on inks at the onset of the pandemic.  We also saw a nice pickup in serialization software sales. Textile printer sales remain soft as global apparel and retail remains impacted by COVID. Ink consumable volumes were up as we significantly improved ink attachment rates and we saw encouraging improvement in the pipeline and new printer sales as the quarter progressed.  Margins improved slightly in the segment on higher volumes and we were able to offset material cost inflation with strategic pricing during the quarter.  Pumps & Process Solutions posted 18% organic growth in the quarter on improved volumes across all businesses except precision components. Order rates and shipments for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong. Industrial pumps had a solid quarter, driven by improved end market conditions and distributor demand. And polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year on robust demand in Asia and the US.  Precision components was down in the quarter though demand conditions stabilized in hydrodynamic bearings and compression parts, as well as broadly in China through new OEM builds remains impacted.  Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded by 890 basis points on strong volume, favorable mix and pricing. This team has moved this segment to best in class top line and bottom line metrics through a dedication to operational excellence, robust product development, and innovation management, and proactive and purposeful inorganic actions. It's a world class collection of assets that we will continue to invest behind.  Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its solid momentum from the second half of last year, posting 18% organic growth. Revenue on new orders in beverage can making more than doubled year-over-year. Food retail saw broad-based increases across its product lines as key retailers resumed capital investment in product programs, plus we've seen good demand for some of our new product introductions and customer wins. Our natural refrigerant systems business in particular experienced robust demand in Europe and the US as customers are adopting more environmentally friendly solutions. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in Asia and Europe across all end markets. Foodservice equipment was down in the quarter, but saw a stabilization in chain restaurant demand.  Despite operational challenges in food retail due to availability issues with insulation raw materials, adjusted margin performance improved by 450 basis points, supported by stronger volumes, productivity initiatives and cost actions we took in the middle of 2020, partially offset by input cost inflation.  I'll pass it to Brad from here. Thanks, Brad. Let's go to slide [technical difficulty]. We expect demand in Engineered Products to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year, which is supported by a robust backlog. We continue to see strong bookings trends in vehicle services and industrial automation. Aerospace and defense have significant revenue visibility through its government programs and is booked well into the second half of the year.  Order rates on waste handling improved significantly during the first quarter, though the shipment schedule will be levered towards the second half and we're watching the supply chain here closely, which is a stabilizer we expect a gradual recovery through the second half of the year.  As communicated on our investor meeting in November, we expect Fueling Solutions to post moderate organic growth for the year. There was a known headwind from EMB roll off in the US, but order trends support a number of positives offsetting it, including growth in systems and software, recovery in underground businesses and growth in vehicle wash. We also expect that Asia, China in particular, should stabilize and become a net positive for us in the second half. The ICS acquisition which we closed at the end of last year is off to a very good start as vehicle wash market is recovering healthily.  Imaging & ID is expected to perform well this year. Our core marking and coating business, stalwarts in 2020, is expected to continue to deliver low to mid-single digit growth with services and serialization products positively impacting performance.  Digital textile printing remains slow, although we saw a year-over-year improvement in ink tonnage sales in Q1 as we continue executing our strategy to attach consumables to machine sales. We expect recovery here in the second half.  Pumps & Process Solutions should have another solid year. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remains robust and trading conditions in industrial pumps rebounded quickly in the first quarter, and momentum should continue. Our recent investments in biopharma capacity were prescient, and we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on the secular growth story.  Plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance as a global shortage of plastic and rubber as well as petrochemical investments are driving increased investment in processing plants. Precision components have stabilized and we expect it to contribute to year-over-year growth again in the second half of the year.  With its large backlog and high order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to have a strong year. New orders in the core food retail businesses have been healthy in the last few quarters as retailers that had paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic are restarting these strategic initiatives.  Additionally, we are capitalizing on our leadership position in natural refrigerant systems both in Europe and also in the US, where we believe the recent mandate in California will foretell a trend among the other 49 states to mandate the transition to more environmentally friendly solutions. We also see good growth in our specialty product line and small format customers segment.  Belvac continues to work through a record backlog and had another significant bookings quarter in Q1. They are booked for the year. Our heat exchanger business is seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We are investing in capacity and new capabilities in these two businesses and are well positioned to capture growth.  Demand is stabilized in food service equipment at restaurant chains and we expect the institutional business to recover in the second half as students return to schools and traffic improves at stadiums and hotels. Our revised annual guidance is on page 10. We covered the most pertinent of these items [technical difficulty] and we summarized them here for your reference.  Finally, slide 11 puts expected 2021 performance in a multi-year perspective. Our 2019 investor presentation, we highlighted how the changes to Dover's portfolio over the prior decade shaped a less cyclical business and provided attractive through cycle returns. 2020 was proof of lower top line cyclicality in a demanding environment and our ability to protect profitability.  Operational excellence and operating margin expansion has been our priority over the last couple of years and we are on track to deliver more than 100 basis points of average margin expansion over that period. And we have the playbook and tools for this to continue.  Dover is positioned to deliver attractive double-digit EPS growth, in line with our long-term corporate targets communicated in 2019.  Before wrapping up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their hard work delivering these results and their continued perseverance.  And that's the end of the presentation. So, Andrey, we can open it up for Q&A. No. Look, at the end of the day, Q1 was stronger than we expected. So, I think that we're quite pleased in our ability to pivot operationally to get the product out the door. I think that we're probably being arguably conservative to get another quarter under our belt to see how much of that backlog and demand is being influenced by channel restocking and trying to get in front of raw material perceived price increases in the future. And I'm not entirely clear right now how much of Q1 overperformance was taken from Q2, which is seasonally when we kind of ramp. So, it's usually a low Q1, big move in Q2, Q3 and then kind of run for cash in Q4. You just can't do the math and say, well, historically, it's been this percentage of revenue and operating profit and this is what the seasonality is, and if I take Q1 as a proxy and I run my spreadsheet, it kicks out an extraordinarily high number, both on the revenue side and the operating margin side.  So, from the revenue side, I think fair enough, we may be a little conservative. We'd like to see our bookings go through Q2. I'll tell you sitting here in April that it's not deteriorating, which is a good news. So, that portends a pretty decent Q3 that we've got coming up, but we'd like to see how that develops over time.  Because make no mistake, there's a couple of things here. Operationally, it is getting kind of difficult out there in terms of sourcing raw materials, labor availability, a variety of different things out there. We had some headwinds in the first quarter, but I'll tell you that operationally, we plowed through. We're not out of the woods yet. Right now, we missed shipments in both ESG and in retail refrigeration because of component availability. I don't really know yet whether that's going to get better or worse.  My final comment, and I know this is a long answer, but you're at the head of the line and this is going to be the question we knew we were going to get, is from a margin point of view, and I think that I discussed this at the end of 2020, the incremental margin expectation for Q2, because the comp is so good, has been overstated on margin because of our ability to use furlough mechanisms that were subsidized by the government, meaning we can take production people off of our payroll because we had subsidies in place to account for it. So, you actually have a snap back of costs. Now, we're in pretty good shape because our revenue is up so much, so we should be able to absorb it. But I think, by and large, what I've seen that there's an expectation in industrial world where the incremental in Q2 margin performance is a lot higher than we would expect.  The second answer on the margin performance in the balance of the year is we really expect to accelerate in refrigeration over the balance of the year. So, we've got this big backlog. It's up to us to get it out. So, out of the growth that we expect in the balance of the year, a lot more of that growth is going to \u2013 from refrigeration than it was in Q1. And as you know, that is dilutive to margins as they go forward. So, I would caution you not to take Q1 incremental margins and just multiply it by three. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Without question. Well, I didn't expect that one today, Andy. Look, I'll put it this way. We're pleased with the operational performance and we're pleased with the mix impact on the operating margin, clearly reaching 19% at the segment level in Q1 of 2021. The 20%, I guess, is earlier in reach than even we had been modeling it in the past. Now, that is going to be \u2013 I'm not going to do this big mix discussion again. I guess over the balance of the year \u2013 so number one, the answer is we're going to get to 20% earlier than we thought based on current trajectory. So, what that means \u2013 I'm not putting a target out there yet. We'll give you one maybe in Q3.  What we are going to fight against between now and the end of the year, we've discussed the mix impact of margins, is inflationary input costs between raw materials, labor, and price costs. As we discussed, at the end of 2020, we were on the front foot in terms of getting price out there. Think about it in terms of inventory change, the inflation on the raw materials was not in our inventory. So, you get positive price cost early in the transition as long as you stay on the front foot. Now, we're going to be really closely watching price cost over the balance of the year in terms of net realization. So, we would have expected to get the biggest benefit in Q1. By and large, that's where we expect it. The way it's looking, we may have to intervene on price, again, in certain of the businesses over the balance of the year. And that will impact the margin performance.  So, yeah, look, 2020 when we put the target out there was 400 basis points improvement, I think, from the time period we put it out there. Clearly, I think we'll be revisiting those longer-term targets sometime this year. Well, it's getting higher with every passing month of the backlog build. So if you go back and look at the comments, refrigeration gets a lot of the color, it's the biggest piece of the segment, their backlog continued to build. That's the one that we said that we're relatively confident that we're in kind of a secular growth period for, we would say, 36 months [indiscernible] see it. I think it's been augmented now by transition to CO2 which should be somewhat of a tailwind that we didn't really recognize maybe even six months ago. So I think that's helpful. And how long the transition from expanding capacity in can making and the transition from PEP to aluminum, how long that goes, remains to be seen. As Brad mentioned I think in his comments, we're booking well into 2022 now.  On the heat exchanger side, I think that we are outgrowing the market quite frankly. I think that we've got some unique positioning, especially in heat pumps. We are expanding capacity now. So, based on new product launches and expanded capacity, I think that we can outgrow the market. But generally speaking, that's a low-single digit growing market over time. We'd like to see if we can push through and kind of outperform. I think we have some exposure on electronic components. It's not huge, but it does impact a few of our businesses. And that is more not chip bait. That is logistics supply chain based. So, you can go take a look at what's going on in the Port of Los Angeles right now. I'm hoping that that will unbuckle now that COVID seems to be passing. But a lot of that is just moving the materials that are sourced out of Asia.  But the whole freight logistics chain is kind of \u2013 I guess it's tight right now. And it's tight. And it's reflected in the logistics costs that we've had to bear. And it's tight in terms of getting the deliveries we want.  But then, like anything else at Dover, becomes very anecdotal because we're not vertically integrated industrial, making one product. So, we've had issues with hydraulic components in ESG. We'd have issue with lighting systems in refrigeration. So, there's a laundry list of things. But for the most part, it's, let's call it, supply chain logistics constraints that are impacting us. It is a very good mix in the quarter. We made that presentation last year about our biopharma and single use pumps business. I kind of tried to give everybody idea what that business was capable of delivering at. So, that was a business because of its capacity utilization is running \u2013 is converting at gross margin level right now, which is very healthy. We're watching it closely. Right now, it is actually a short cycle business. We're trying to build our backlog, but we really don't have a lot of visibility. So I think that we're being prudent in terms of our second half estimates, in terms of how long that goes.  On the industrial pump side, it's actually been quite robust also, but that's more channel inventory. Interestingly, we had a very good performance in China in the pump business in Q1, and it's been some time since we've seen that, and the margins were quite healthy. And you have to recall that the management had been very proactive in taking costs out in 2020. And so, we have the roll forward benefit on the industrial pump side on the margin moving into 2021. So, that was quite healthy. I think on pumps and polymers, this is a business that I think that the management team has effectively doubled the margin in the last three years. So, gross margins in that business are healthy again.  So, overall, what's going to impact the margin the most is going to be mix. Even when precision components does come back in the second half, it's not overtly dilutive to it. Slightly so. The bigger issue is going to be how does demand hold up on single use pumps in the second half of the year? Let's start at the top. If our capital goods businesses return in the second half, as we would expect, that would meet our original forecasts, I think it's \u2013 vehicle services group looks to be poised to get a \u2013 probably a full point of organic growth that we did not expect at the beginning of the year.  The printing and ID business is performing as expected. Clearly, the upside is if textile comes back in a robust fashion in the second half. Right now, we don't have the backlog that would support that thesis. But if it turns, we'll probably have a lot more color on that one at the end of the second quarter.  DFS looks like it may have a point, if not two. One of those points is based on the acquisitions that we've made. So, you get a point of growth there. When that rolls into organic or not, I have to look in the calendarization of blah, blah, blah. But just in terms of total, that's why we gave out total growth early on here and didn't try to parse it between organic and inorganic, but we may get a point of growth. We'd like to take a real close look on OPW or the undergrad portion of it and see how it develops on hanging hardware. But we'd expect that to get better over the year, offsetting what's likely to be the negative EMB headwind that we have on the above ground side in the second half. I answered Jeff Sprague's question about Pumps & Process Solutions. So I've gone through that one.  And look, our backlog in DRFE, Belvac adding to its backlog doesn't do anything with the revenue. They're going to pause, it's purely execution now, how much of that backlog they can realize. And we just expanded capacity there to help them do it. I think the outlier is going to be refrigeration. So, we've got a real robust backlog. That is a short cycle business. So, we don't have \u2013 I think we may be eating into the beginning of Q3 right now in terms of orders. So we don't have anything for Q4. I think we probably need another quarter to kind of get that tightened down. Okay, a couple of things. We are giving latitude to our businesses to build working capital to compete for market share at this point, number one. And number two, I think that we mentioned, at the end of the year, we've given some latitude on working capital to prebuy their own raw materials to get in front of what we expect it to be inflationary environment.  The fact of the matter is, in Q1, the performance is based on a couple things. Number one, we did not \u2013 our payables balance exiting 2020 was not as high as it had been in previous quarters. So, there wasn't a snap back in terms of making those payables in Q1 that we've seen in the past. And quite frankly, our conversion or velocity of working capital in Q1, because the revenue was what it was, was a lot higher than we would normally see. So, look, [indiscernible] hit your nail on the head. In absolute terms, if we're guiding the revenue up and the margin looks like it's proactive, then in absolute dollars, then free cash flow should move at the same. We're working really hard on it. And I think that we probably like a quarter or two can revisit the metric as a percent of revenue. But for right now, I think we're confident that absolute dollar cash flow would be quite healthy. Well, you basically have the Q&A that we give to the person that runs that business for us, and we try to unpack that. The only recent data that we do have is that development for follow-on vaccines looks like it's quite robust, number one, and that there was a view at some point that you are going to move from skid development to much larger incubators over time and that transition is negative to single use and we don't see it right now. Now, does that change between now and the end of the year? Our view? I'm sure it will change every quarter as we work through it. And that's why we're being a bit cautious in terms of the duration of the demand that we have in that particular sector. Because if it goes to large incubation, then the volume or the demand, this is a business that's been growing in the high teens for 24 months now. When that begins to roll over, right now we don't see it. I can tell you that right now, we're expanding at capacity again in the case that it's durable. But it's hard to say right now. I don't know. I'd have to go do the sums for corporate average, but our expectation that they will be a larger contributor to year-over-year profits in at minimum Q2 and Q3. Can I say hard to say, John? Look, we're raising prices \u2013 this all started with raw materials. So, you can go through our portfolio. Clearly, the capital goods side has got the biggest exposure to the raw materials and they were on the front foot at the beginning. And from what we can see, so far, it looks like the entire complex is following along. Now it takes 90 to 180 days to see what realization is because you get pricing out there, then you got inventory turns, and blah, blah, blah. So, that's where it started.  But the fact of the matter is, I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation. But there is inflation. And it's not just the raw materials because raw materials are in the sub-components that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly, at the assembly level, on labor, availability is becoming a problem. And that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from \u2013 it's the capital good sides that are buying a lot of raw materials. Now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business, that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year.  On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs, we ship a lot of product that's FOB. It's more inbound logistics costs than it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because \u2013 God forbid you have to air freight anything right now, it's a bit of a negative. So, we are going to be on it in terms of price costs. And it's hard for us because of the disparity of the SKUs that we have in this portfolio. It's not like we're making cars. So we're going to be on it. And it's a trailing number and we're going to have to do it as a combination of as the numbers come out and our intuition going in. But at worst, it's going to have to be a scenario of net neutral. Well, I guess the answer is yes. But let me give you an example. We have raised prices in refrigeration and lost volume because of it. Because we're more interested in that particular business to raising the operating margin. And as a material component of the market structure, it's up to us to lead the market and stop complaining about the fact that there's no pricing power in it. So, that's an example there.  We've got certain other businesses where our gross margins are significantly higher. And there, we may waive it off because if we've got an opportunity to grab share, now's the time to do it. So, we don't manage the portfolio and giving a \u2013 here's the three bullet points and everybody go execute it. We do it based on market structure, competitive environment, and a variety of other things. So, it's a combination of a variety of things. Whether it's price cost, positive defaults to the bottom line, or market share gains and gross margins that fall to the bottom line, we'll take it either way. Well, I guess the good news, Scott, is that as our margins move up, we can be more expansive in terms of what the multiple was willing to pay because if we wound the clock back a couple years ago, a lot of what we looked at was trading at a much higher multiple that we're trading at and we've gone a long way of fixing it. So, yeah, we're looking at some interesting things in the pipeline. Look at the cash flow this year, is proactive. So, as I mentioned at the end of last year that we're going to make some quicker decisions probably this year in terms of capital deployment or capital return. So, yeah, I think that \u2013 look, the management team here was challenged to deliver margin accretion over time on the base portfolio. And the trade-off was, if you do so, then we're going to reinvest in your businesses. We've done that on an organic basis in a meaningful way. I think that we've got certain portions of the portfolio that have earned the right now to be a little bit more expansive inorganically. So, we're probably more on the front foot today than we've been in my tenure here. Yeah, you've got to be careful. I think that we've done a few of them here now. So I think that we're getting better at them in terms of how much inventory do we have to prebuild to accommodate for execution risk. I'm confident that I think that the two bigger ones that we have going on right now, we've got \u2013 just like we did in refrigeration \u2013 the floor space to accommodate kind of the CapEx portion of the project, to run on the installed base. So you've got a transitory period, but it's not as if you have to shut down to redo the plant and do it that way. It's kind of you build it on the side and you just open it up over time.  A lot of what else we're doing now is we're doing a lot of work on the machining centers. And that's productivity related that we're spending pretty heavily in right now. And that's some of our lower gross margin businesses. We're trying to kind of bring those up over time. And we've got some real interesting ones going on in some of our higher volume throughput businesses on inspection technology that is allowing us to increase capacity without expanding the physical footprint. And that's the one I referenced before on the biopharma side. No, overall, as a corporation, we overdeliver. I would have expected that we could have forced through the funnel. If I told you about the meetings we were having around here in early January about our Q1 forecasts, we were yelling at everybody about moving them up. And then we've got a lot of demand. And I would have expected that we would have had \u2013 we had anecdotal issues that I referenced, but the fact of the matter is, in total, we over delivered. So, what went on in Pumps & Process Solutions as a whole, their ability to get that amount of product out in an intra-quarter period where they actually didn't even have all those orders, I think, was impressive. So, we did lose some volume in ESG. We lost some volume in refrigeration. But overall, we over deliver them what I would have expected if I looked at kind of backlog conversion expectation going into the year. I think that we would have expected to be positive in Q1 just because of the timing of the action that we took on pricing, which actually started in Q4 of last year. And then it gives then between what's stuck in inventory and then what is pre-announced kind of these \u2013 the price increases effective April 1 and how does that drive backlog and whether you can reprice that backlog. I think that we're vigilant about it. But bottom line is, the only way we're really going to know is over time. So, I don't know Q2 right now, whether we're going to be price cost, whether it's going to be a credit or debit. I think it's going to be a credit, right? But between announced price increases and price realization, and all of the noise around the subcomponents because you can't measure inflation and you can do it for raw materials and castings because it's kind of bulk orders and you only have a few suppliers, but you're talking about subcomponents across this portfolio, it's quite difficult to measure. So, Brad and I were discussing it this morning. It's the one thing that we've got to really keep our eyes on. And look, we'll have more color on it by the time we close Q2. All of the above, Josh, I guess. Look, if we go back to 2019, we've introduced a lot of new products, believe it or not, between our 2019 base and our 2021 trajectory. We've also been, I want to say, overly active in M&A, but we did some inorganic investments from 2019 through 2021. So, those end up being topline credits. Forget what the total aggregate demand environment is.  Look, the recovery looks like it's broad based at the end of the day. There are trade-offs were, in 2019, certain geographies are stronger, and now they're weaker, but they have their own reasons why. I think that the only one that we can really point to where there's an inflection of the demand environment is refrigeration. But we talked about that, leading into 2021, where we went through a three to four year period where the capital base was under invested by big box retail and now we're going into a cycle. We're calling it a three year cycle. Let's hope it's four. And then you've got some interesting changes in in \u2013 structural changes like that are impacting things like Belvac where this transition to aluminum cans is kind of cyclical where you know that business hasn't grown in a very long time. And now it's making a pretty sweeping transition for COVID reasons and environmental reasons. So, the 2019 base is important, but we would have expected that if we rebased 2019 for new product launches and acquisitions, that base would have been higher anyway at the end of the day, if that answers your question. It depends on the business at the end of the day and the market structure. We tend to compete in some pretty concentrated market structures where unless there's a disparity between us and an individual competitor, that's what we're competing with. I think it remains to be seen whether the distribution demand begins to \u2013 that rate of increase slows down because if it's not liquidating \u2013 it's not liquidating out of distribution inventory at the same pace that it's coming in, then, obviously, it's going to slow down. It's a bit too early to tell, quite frankly. So, the long lead time items where markets are concentrated, I don't think it's going to have a negative impact on the short cycle side. What we're trying to do on the short cycle side is forcefully build the backlog because generally speaking, the bigger backlog that we are, the more efficient we are as producers, but that is going to be tied up on the competitive environment and product availability and everything else. So we'll see."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir.\nJack Dickens: Thank you, Gretchen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through February 21, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Dover provides non-GAAP information, and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks Jack. Let\u2019s get started with the performance highlights on Slide 3. Dover delivered strong organic revenue growth of 9% and margin improvement of 150 basis points in the fourth quarter. Volume mix, price cost and prior period cost reduction actions all contributed to the positive performance. As we've been forecasting throughout 2021, the relationship between supply chain constraints and bookings has continued to play out into Q4. The majority of the labor and component availability and logistics constraints have dissipated resulting in production lead times returning to pre pandemic levels. Importantly, our 4% annualized through cycle organic bookings growth rate reflects the continued secular demand strength across our businesses. Our order backlog remains elevated compared to normal levels, and provides us with a good topline visibility going into [Indiscernible]. Our continuous efforts to improve productivity and efficiency principally enabled by advances we achieved in e-commerce adoption, back office consolidation and SKU or SKU complexity reduction, resulted in robust margin accretion in the quarter. We expect benefits from our research efforts to further accrue in 2023. We continue to deploy capital toward portfolio improvement, organic growth and production efficiency in 2022. Our capital expenditures in 2022 were the highest in recent Dover history and we continue to invest in manufacturing productivity projects and proactive capacity expansions to fuel our top line growth and margin improvement capabilities. We also completed five attractive bolt-on acquisitions in 2022 that provide exposure to high growth technologies and end markets and finally, we took the opportunity to return capital to our shareholders, including the completion of our 500 million accelerated share repurchase, which was completed in quarter four. We entered 2023 with a constructive stance. Demand trends remain healthy across a portfolio and we have a significant volume of business in backlog entering to the New Year. Expected revenue growth price actions and productivity measures from 2022 lay the foundation for margin accretion in 2023 have high confidence in Dover's end markets, flexible business model and proven execution playbook continuing to deliver earnings growth. Our strategy for robust through cycle shareholder value creation remains unchanged, to combine solid and consistent growth above GDP, strong operational execution generating meaningful margin accretion over time, and value added discipline capital deployment. As a result of this, we are forecasting for -- guided revenue guidance of 3% to 5% Organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $8.85 to $9.05. I'll skip slide 4, and let's move on to Slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 16% in the quarter continuing the trend of double-digit top line growth through the year. Revenue growth was broad based across the portfolio of particular strength in North America. Margins continued the sequential build throughout the year finishing -- 20% at 620 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by improving supply chains and price cost dynamics products mix as well as events investments and productivity initiatives. Clean Energy & Fueling finished the quarter and the year roughly flat on organic basis. Revenue performance for the quarter was up and clean energy components. Vehicle wash, fuel transport and below-ground retail fuel, offsetting the comparable declined a dispenser and EMV card readers in the period. Margins in the quarter were up 170 basis points on positive price cost and the mix impact from both organic, inorganic investments that we made in clean energy components and vehicle wash. This was augmented by further cost reduction actions initiatives in the third quarter, and the full, the full year carry over these actions will continue to accrue in 2023. In Imaging & Identification, volumes for our marking and coding printers, spare parts and consumables were strong in all geographies, with the exception of near term softness in China due to the COVID impact. Our software businesses continue to perform well with penetration of key customer brand accounts with strong growth in SaaS portion of our serialization software. FX remained negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in the segment given its large base of non-US dollar revenue. Q4 margins in Imaging & ID were very strong at 25% improving 250 basis points on stronger volumes, pricing actions and products product mix richness. This business has delivered exemplary margin improvement in the last few year years as it utilizes our productivity tools for e-commerce back office consolidation and offshore engineering. Pumps & Process Solutions was up 4% organically for the year but posted a 4% decline in the fourth quarter driven principally by post-COVID transition in the biopharma space. The non-COVID biopharma business has continued to grow and our overall biopharma business as well above its pre-pandemic level. New orders for biopharma connectors reflected positively in the fourth quarter after several quarters of sequential declines. All other business this segment posted solid organic growth in the fourth quarter with particular strength in polymer processing equipment and precision components in the back of improved conditions in energy markets. Operating margin for the quarter was 29% is comparable revenue mix of products delivered. Top line in Climate & Sustainability technologies continued its double digit growth in the fourth quarter posted 27% organic growth across all business geographies. Demand trends remain particularly robust in heat exchangers and CO2 refrigeration systems driven by the global investments in sustainability. Our capacity expansion programs in both these businesses remain on schedule and will continue to allow us to continue to meet growing customer demand. Margins are up 450 basis points in the quarter and over 300 basis points for the full year on improved productivity in food, retail and strong volume growth and good mix of product delivered. I\u2019ll pass it on to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. The top bridge shows our quarterly organic revenue growth of 9% driven by increases in four of our five segments. As expected FX was a substantial headwind at 5% or $94 million and impacted both revenue growth and profitability. FX headwinds resulted in Q4 and full year 2022 negative EPS impacts of $0.10 and $0.35 respectively. Recent euro gains against dollar have reduced our forecasted FX headwinds in 2023, which we currently estimate at $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year EPS. M&A contributed $58 million to the top line in the quarter, a product of $80 million from acquisitions partially offset by $22 million from divestitures late in 2021. We saw a strong organic growth across most of our geographies in the quarter. The U.S. our largest market was up 7% organically, Europe was up 19% organically driven by particular strength in polymer processing, beverage can making, natural refrigerate systems and heat exchangers. All of Asia was down 1%. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia declined by about 10% in Q4, driven by short term impacts from the COVID resurgence. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to foreign exchange, translation and normalizing lead times across several businesses. Now on our cash flow statement on page, slide 7. Free cash flow for the year came in at $585 million, down year-over-year on increased capital expenditures, onetime tax payments and investments and working capital supporting growth. At our current earnings margin, we would expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 13% of revenue in an average year. 2022 free cash flow lagged behind that level, due primarily to elevate a working capital investment striving two thirds of the gap. As previously discussed, our view -- we view incremental investment in inventory over the past two years as productive despite its carrying cost enabling us to deliver 17% cumulative organic top line growth and over 30% growth in absolute EBITDA between 2019 and 2022. We are now focused on extracting back cash invested in inventory. As supply chain is improved in the fourth quarter, we began reducing inventory particularly finished goods. The majority of excess we carry into 2023 is in raw materials and we expect to consume a significant portion of that excess in the first half of the year. In addition to inventory reductions, we expect to collect elevated receivables from the fourth quarter and normalize our payable balances driving significant improvement in working capital in 2023. We also forecast lower CapEx followed following a stepped up cap next year in 2022. As a result, our forecast for 2023 free cash flow is between 15% and 17% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay, I'm on slide 8. I'll be brief on this slide since we've been discussing the linkages between bookings, backlog and revenue and expected trajectory of these metrics for nearly two years. First to remind everyone that in 2021 bookings of $9.4 billion driven by post-COVID demand surge, as well as constrained supply chains the required customers drew order in advance were roughly 20% higher than our revenue that year resulting in an unprecedented backlog that requires time to ship and unwind while bookings normalize. Importantly, concerns about double ordering and cancellations did not materialize. And we have been depleting the backlog in an orderly fashion as product lead times improved. If we smooth out the post pandemic surge in bookings our bookings CAGR has been 4% from 2019 to 2022. Let's go to Slide 9 here, we show the growth and margin outlook by segment for 2023. that underpin our guidance. We expect Engineered Products to remain solid. Pent-up demand and automation initiatives and waste hauling support our robust outlook. Despite high demand, our refuse collection vehicles shipments in 2022 is still has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to chassis availability. After an excellent performance in vehicle services group in Q4 we expect a slower start in 2023 and Engineered Products is forecast to improve margins in 2023 on solid volumes benefits from our recent productivity capital investments taking hold and positive call price cost tailwinds. Clean Energy & Fueling is expected to grow single digits organically which we expect to be second half weighted due to demand for dispensers during the year. Dispenser bookings beginning to normalize, we expect Q1 to be the trough for the business with gradual recovery through the remainder of the year. All other businesses in the segment are positioned well for growth in 2023, with particular strength in our clean energy components. For the year we expect margin improvements in Clean Energy & Fueling and volume recovery, improved mix and recently enacted restructuring actions and above ground fueling. Imaging & ID is expected to continue its trajectory steady GDP growth and attractive margins. We see robust demand for new printers and components and consumables and professional services the outlook for the bulk serialization and brand protection software is also strong. Margin as business are robust and we expect them to remain as such to 2023. We project flat organic growth in pumps and process solutions. Our industrial pumps and plastics and polymers, precision components and thermo connector businesses are all positioned for solid growth. The biopharma components business is expect to hit its bottom in volume and margin in the first quarter as customers worked through and repurpose excess inventory. We are beginning to see encouraging signs and bookings for our biopharma connectors, and our full year forecasts may prove to be conservative. The long-term tailwinds of single use components for biological drug manufacture remain compelling. And importantly, our products are specified for regulated manufacturing of therapies with attractive growth outlook. And we continue to win new specifications and an active pipeline of new biologic and cell and gene therapies. Margin performance is expected to be roughly flat for the year with a sequentially lower level in the first and second quarters on unfavorable product mix from slower biopharma and geographic mix from higher sales in China, for plastics and polymers. Growth outlook for climate and sustainability technologies remain solid as our businesses continue to ship against strong backlog levels. We are forecasting continued double-digit growth in both natural refrigerant systems and heat exchangers for heat pumps. Our beverage can making businesses booked well into 2023 and expect continued margin improvement in 2023 on volume conversion, productivity gains and mix. Move on to Slide 10. Here we show our recent performance against our capital allocation priorities, our priorities to reinvest in our business, which represents the highest return on investment. 2022 represented a recent record for CapEx with numerous capacity expansions and productivity investments completed. We will continue our efforts to add attractive bolt-on acquisitions to improve our portfolio by entering new markets with secular growth. We invested $325 million into five highly attractive acquisitions in 2022. We're carrying significant firepower in a compelling M&A pipeline into 2023. Finally, as we did in 2022, we will return excess liquidity to our shareholders through increased dividends and opportunistic. Let\u2019s move onto Slide 11. For the wrap up, before we get into our full year guidance I\u2019ll make a few comments on our view of the macro environment and how we believe the year may develop. First and foremost, we hope that the Fed is cautious going forward from here. We support the efforts to tackle inflation, which had had a large hand in causing but we are in the camp that believes the Fed has gone far enough and the lagged effect of the further actions can be problematic to economic growth. Market participants are likely to be cautious with the timing of their demand generating decisions as there is a recognition that manufacturing lead times and logistics constraints have been largely repaired. And as such, we expect first quarter demand to reflect this cautious stance. We expect seasonality to the year to be weighted towards quarters two and three in revenue and earnings and weighted to H1 for cash flow as our balance sheet reflects liquidation of inventory and receivables from 2022. Despite the uncertain macro, our goals remain ambitious, we will push hard to win our share of demand. We have done a lot of work to improve the performance of our products and we believe we would have the right to win. We have proactively expanded capacity to meet projected demand and areas of the portfolio with significant secular growth opportunities. So now let me put our guide in EPS performance of the longer term perspective. Our objectives delivered double-digit through cycle EPS growth for our investors through a balanced mix of healthy revenue growth, margin accretion, value creative capital deployment. We have been delivering on that equipment that had led to that commitment, and we drive will continue to drive to continue to do so. I want to thank our customers for trusting Dover businesses to deliver on their important needs. And I'm grateful to Dover teams across the world for continuing to serve our customers and execute well despite various challenges along the road. That's completes the comments. So Jack, let's go to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning, this is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. And so there are different reasons, reasons for each segment. But the guidance assumes better second half growth in three of the five segments. What's kind of the underlying demand assumption? Are you assuming things are fairly stable? Or do you embed kind of a deterioration in underlying demand given you're seeing better second half growth in several segments?\nRichard Tobin: I think that the feedback that we're getting from our customers is to start off the year cautiously. I think that there's in a lot of portions of the marketplace, there's inventory that needs to be depleted. And I think that there's a concern about the macro. There also is this view that inflation is coming down, and that being prudent about when to start projects is probably going to put them in the money. Furthermore, I think they have a difficult comp in Q1 just because of FX alone. So I don't think there's anything other than as we mentioned, biopharma meeting, getting to the bottom where we expect orders to inflect positively from there. I think it's just an overly cautious stance going into the New Year. Everybody knows that lead times have been prepared -- have been repaired. So it's not as if they have to put the orders in and take and take the deliveries in Q1. So it will actually go back to what had been historically the seasonality of the Dover portfolio, where a little bit of a slow start second quarter and third quarter quite high and then we run for cash in Q4.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then a quick one on China, I heard you that you'd seen some demand disruptions, given the COVID resurgence. Any concern about labor related disruptions of your operations, were -- are suppliers showing up later this year?\nRichard Tobin: No. I mean, from a supply standpoint, we are not overly levered towards China with the exception of electronic components, which don't make a disproportionate high amount of our purchases. So no, I don't I think that China, we the stance is it's going to get better from here, not worse.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.\nRichard Tobin: Welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey Rich, just on the order normalization agreement and talking about this for a long time, do you kind of expect things to revert back to that kind of historical balance for your backlog as, call it 20% or so forward sales by the end of the year? Or do you think this takes a bit longer than normalize?\nRichard Tobin: Well, a lot of that depends on the macro, Jeff at the end of the day. But yes, I mean, yes, we would expect to go back there. I would call your attention to the slide that we had at the end of Q3 that showed normal backlogs by segment. We would expect to go back there. If 19 is normal. Let's say, I think that's what the comparison, comparative number there is. We would expect it to go back there.\nJeff Sprague: And then Rick given\u2026\nRichard Tobin: But it may flex over time. And well, again, I'll leave it at that. It will go back to I would call your attention to that slide. And that's where we're going to end up.\nJeff Sprague: Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, you're the comments to this prior question kind of touched on this a little bit. The nature of my follow up here is what is the price discussion, like on orders now, now that as you say, as to why chains are normalizing, and there's the expectation that inflation does begin to fade. Do you see downward pressure on price and maybe put that in the context of what your own cost equation looks like in 2023?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, we've been pretty disciplined in terms of not repricing our backlog. For sure. So I don't expect any issues there that are not manageable. I think that what we can expect at the beginning of this year is everybody having a view -- we're not and this includes us when we deal with our own suppliers that inflation is coming down. And if I, if I spend some time in Q1 renegotiating maybe I can force the issue to a certain extent. So in our estimates, we don't have any unannounced pricing that's not out in the marketplace, meaning that\u2019s not baked into our numbers, another price increase in the June time period. But it's going to be it's, it's going to be interesting to see how it develops over time. I think it's going to be reflected more in a delay in terms of the order rates, until we get into a position of back and forth of do you -- when do you need the product and when do you have to stop negotiating the price?\nJeff Sprague: And that algorithm leaves your price cost positive for the year as it stands?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Yes. Our estimates are price cost positive for the year based on roll forward, what basically what you see in Q4.\nJeff Sprague: Right, thank you.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys, good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: So it just if you have these backlogs, right, and expect them to expect to work them down over the course of the year. Why wouldn't that mean that, assuming that those lead times I mean, they are extended, but I wouldn't think too extended given the nature of your business. Why wouldn't that, liquidation of backlog help kind of the normal seasonality, assuming that you -- your the trend line is what it is, but you're delivering at a backlog which should help sales in the near term. Why are customers not taking this stuff earlier?\nRichard Tobin: Well, a lot of them are based on their own CapEx plan. So as we as we talked about in the end of Q4 about the decline in dispensers it was kind of interesting to us because we were shipping heavily in the below ground and hardly shipping anything and above ground. And that was a reflection of the delay in getting these projects done because of supply chain constraints and labor and everything else. I think that we're going to see a little, that's an example. We're going to see a little bit of that more in Q1. Right? So despite having the backlog, the customers are not saying, what, deliver it on January 1, and I'll go put it in the warehouse, and I'll pull it out when I want. They just don't feel the need. That's what was kind of going on in the marketplace to a certain extent, for a period of time. As that accordion effect is beginning to unwind. Yes, the backlog is there, but they're saying, what, here's the timing of my project, and I may want it in March. I may want it in April. So the depletion will be orderly over the balance of the year.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then how much price are you, are you assuming this year in the organic?\nRichard Tobin: I don't think that we disclose that, but it's a good portion of the organic growth is price.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, and then one last one for you just on orders. I think to get to that level of backlog at the end of the year looks like it's roughly I don't know, like a $2 billion backlog assuming a mid-single digit growth rate, which would imply roughly 6 billion of orders. Is that does that feel about right?\nRichard Tobin: Let me do it in my head. Yes, that's, that's close. Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And\u2026\nRichard Tobin: It gets very much it's going to be very much contingent of what happens in the long cycle portion of the business, right? The Maags and the Belvac and to a certain extent, SWEP, which is becoming a long-cycle business, because we're beginning to rather than sell the products and selling capacity. So if those three hang in there, then yes, that's what that's all be.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay. That, and those would be the toughest comps in the first half.\nRichard Tobin: Correct.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay. Great. Thanks.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hey Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So, Rich I just want to make sure I understand your seasonality comments as it relates to the first quarter. Because if I go back to like prior seasonality, you could see, the first quarter being kind of like a high teens percentage of the full year to kind of mid 20s. I mean, if I use the midpoint, it kind of puts me around the $2 range. If I'm doing the math, right. For the first quarter, I just want to make sure that I'm level setting correctly.\nRichard Tobin: Joe, I don't have Excel open here in front of me. I'd like to just -- look at the end of the day this is just a general statement about the feedback that we're getting from the marketplace, right. Everybody's concerned about recession. And so there's a bias towards being very careful with inventory also included. So we just think that the take off is back to the question that Steve asked before is that the backlog is there, but the take rate on that backlog should start out slowly, right, until everybody gets in place where we can, a lot of what we deliver goes right to the project site. And a lot of cases least the businesses that are tethered to distribution. So I'm, I'm not calling for a collapse in Q1 by any stretch of the margin. But, but we don't want to do it, the only reason that we're calling it out is we're coming out of periods where we had very strong Q1s in the seasonality versus the past got a little bit out of whack. So we're just telling you to just be careful with Q1, the full year is the full year. And we're confident in that. But I think they just we have to be, we have to recognize that is an amount of caution in the marketplace. And everybody's going to be very careful about how much inventory they lay in until they can see what's going on with kind of the macro, per se.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. No, that makes sense. I guess maybe my quick follow up, I think last quarter, you guys had called out I think like a roughly $0.23 benefit in DC from the cost actions. And you're continuing to highlight, kind of margin improvement this year. Can you maybe so, firstly, we still on track for that $0.23. And then secondly, across the rest of the portfolio, where are you seeing opportunities for margin expansion in 2023?\nRichard Tobin: I think all of the $0.23 was not in clean energy. I think $0.19 of the $0.23 if I remember correctly, more or less is in there. Yes.\nJoe Ritchie: And some of that was in the fourth quarter too.\nRichard Tobin: And some of that was in the fourth quarter also because we actually took the cost actions in Q3 But everything is on track. What you do as you get -- you get a bad comp in that business because it was still delivering pretty heavily in Q1, but we expect that to be offset by clean energy components and below ground and car wash, which are margin accretive. So you get basically over the year, a positive inflection of mix on the portfolio, but I think you just have to be a little bit careful in Q1 just because the above ground is a bad comp.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Rich, could you give us a little more color regarding your expectations for DPPS in 2023. What's your conviction level in terms of biopharma connectors destock ending in Q1? I know you mentioned book is inflected sequentially. And then you're -- just in terms of margin, I know you're forecasting flattish for the year in this segment. Given where Q4 2022 left off, it's not that easy to get there. So maybe you could elaborate on your cost controls and productivity actions in that segment that gets you back to those 2022 levels?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Well, we did take cost out as volume came out of the sector for sure, and we did that progressively through the year. And I think we took a further action in the end of Q3, Q4, more or less. Look, orders are beginning to inflect. We are paying a lot of attention to the commentary of our customers out there who are basically saying it's an H1 event and then expect to have all the inventory cleared. I will tell you that we have not been overly ambitious in our estimates for the full year. So I think if we're going to -- I think that we may have a little bit more difficult H1, but I think that we've got a better and even chance to have a better-than-expected performance in the second half of the year. But what we'd like to see is the order rates come up and us start expanding capacity to deal with it, which I think we can turn around to do it. So yes, the flat margins year-over-year. We're going to have to be really careful with our cost controls, and we're going to have to deliver polymers and plastics and precision components are going to have to deliver on the volume that we expect to get out of those businesses. But it's not like we're being overly ambitious in volume in biopharma for the year.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Great. And then, Rich, I know you don't want to tell us all about your Investor Day in March. But maybe in terms of -- you've talked about portfolio management a little more frequently lately, so maybe update us on that. And then obviously, you talked at the beginning of your prepared comments around SKU management. We know you've been really focused on costs. So in terms of longer-term margin targets, anything to sort of talk about their preview there? I assume margins can rise pretty significantly from where they ended in 2022?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean that's going to be part of it Andy, at the end of the day. So let's not the card before the horse, but we're going to basically do what we did back in 2019 and try to give you a 3-year forward role by segment and what we think the contributing factors to it. I mean a lot of it is going to be on-going productivity, but I think what's underestimated is that the organic revenue potential is underestimated. And I think we've done a lot of work in terms of mix here. So the mix of the products that we have today versus what we started with in 2020 is, I think, a lot different than that was back then. So it's not some ambitious we're going to grow completely out of the order. I think we'll grow higher than basically the market expects us because we generally get bottom quartile expected growth rates and revenue, but I think mix is going to be the most important aspect of it.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Do you expect to give a specific target around organic growth? Or is it like GDP plus?\nRichard Tobin: I don't know yet.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Fair enough. Thanks Rich.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hey good morning guys.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: The -- I probably asked this a couple of quarters ago, but the M&A markets, Richard, they come down to kind of more realistic levels for you guys and expect to be a little bit more active in 2023?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I guess taking on any leverage to do a deal has not been well received by anybody. So I guess we'd have to be careful with a larger deal presently for whatever reason, the capital markets are not looking kindly on leverage for, I guess, the reasons we can understand about unsurety of the macro going forward. But yes, I think that what we've seen so far is that a realistic multiples are now becoming -- are reflective of what's going on in the capital markets. So you always have -- most of our deals are private, as you know, private companies. There's always a lag between the public capital markets at a private valuation. I think that, that has narrowed towards to the public capital markets.\nScott Davis: Okay. And I don't like the traffic of minutia [ph], but is there such a thing as a can-making cycle? I mean what -- it seems like we've had pretty high demand year for several years in a row. What -- what's in the other side of it? Is there a big investment cycle now and that it's just kind of air pockets after that? Or is there some new dynamic involved in that world?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I'm not allowed to say that the AP, right because the CTAs love to pick up on that step. But yes, look, I mean, it is a cyclical business and there are investment cycles and part and parcel is to not over capacitize yourself as the cycle goes up and the recapture on the spare parts, which are margin accretive on the way down. So that's the way that we look at the business. Now having said that, it will be interesting to see what happens with PET in drinks going forward. I know that there's been a little bit of a pushback on ESG lately. But the fact of the matter is that PET from an environmental point of view is not a preferred option. So to the extent that the cost plus ESG aspect of PET over time make aluminum more attractive, then we could -- that is by far the largest portion of the market. So even if a recapture rate of 15% of PET market would drive another cycle. So that's kind of where we are right now.\nScott Davis: All right. Good luck guys in 2023.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Hey good morning guys.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Rich, so you've been sort of holographing what's happened with orders and backlog and kind of watching the Fed movements for a while now and been more concerned about them we're doing it. Does your view of kind of downturn management look different because of some of the scarcity that we've had the last 2 years in terms of hiring folks, looking for new suppliers, maybe honoring existing agreements? Does any of that look different with the recovery on the other side we kind of have more of the same scarcity that we've had in the past.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I wouldn't expect to run into the logistics constraints that we've seen. I think that was a one-off. I mean, you had just such a collapse of the macro and then a restart and then add a lot of the energy markets went haywire which drove the logistics market say, well, I don't expect that to happen. I mean I think that capacity was brought on. And if you look at logistics costs and the forward curves there, I don't expect that to repeat under any reasonable macro scenario from here. I think there is a lot of liquidity that's being taken from the general market. I think that lending is very low right now. It's very difficult to get loans and secure loans -- secure liquidity to run businesses out there. I'm not making it a Dover comment. I'm talking in total. So I'm concerned about that. And if that's the case, and there's the only way that if you're a private company, the only way you can generate liquidity in order to continue to fund yourself is to draw down inventory balances to extremely low levels, and that's negative to orders and revenue going forward. So that's our overall concern of -- I don't see the point of bringing out another 50 basis points only to turn around and give the 50 basis points back into Q4. Why bother? Why can't we just sit where we're standing right here because liquidity in the market is incredibly tight right now. So that's the fear. At the end of the day is that you have a delayed CapEx cycle, which we ascribe to the fact that there is a CapEx need out there because of productivity to offset higher labor costs, and then you've got all the stimulus money out there. But fact of the matter is there's no liquidity to accompany that I think that you have a delay effect that could be problematic.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the 4Q orders, any sense from you guys as lead times have improved that this is sort of the quarter where customers kind of squeeze the accordion on, hey, we don't need things 16 weeks earlier than normal anymore. So let's get back to maybe more normal ordering pace. Like -- is there an artificial low that you go through on orders as lead times normalize? Or is that something that's kind of barely perceptible over the medium term?\nRichard Tobin: No, that's exactly what we think, and we think it's going to continue through Q1. And then from there, we expect based on our view of the demand cycle that it will inflect positively from there. But I think you're going to get another quarter of exactly how you described it, right? I know I can get the product. I have enough inventory to carry me through the quarter. I'm going to take the chance of depleting it because I know you can deliver into Q2.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Very helpful. Thanks. Best of luck guys.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Guy Hardwick from Credit Suisse.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, good morning.\nGuy Hardwick: Rich, I think on the last call, you talked about a fundamental change in the business model in DCF. Are you ready to talk a bit more about that today?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I would leave that to the Investor Day, right? I mean, I think that my comment was is that -- we went through this period of EMV and then we went through this period of the overhype EV taking over the world, and we were basically saying that we believe that we can position this business to harvest profits for 20 years. And I think that we're -- we've made the moves in Q3 of this year to begin to position ourselves appropriately there, right? So there was no sense of doing it in advance of a rising revenue curve. But now that it flattens out, we've got to run the business differently on one hand. And on the other hand, we've been a pretty active acquirer in that particular segment as we transition to clean energy exposure, particularly in the hydrogen space. So we're doing it -- but I would -- if you're looking for, what does that mean going forward from here in a holistic way, why don't we wait until March and we'll surely talk about it.\nGuy Hardwick: And just a follow-up. Could you clarify that backlog math? Where do you think you could be at the end of the year?\nRichard Tobin: Why don't we take this off-line because everybody's got a different calculation of if it's -- I think that there was 20% of the annual revenue should be in backlog in a normal time. So we got what our forecast is for revenue for this year. So it's a relatively easy calculation.\nGuy Hardwick: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Hi, good morning everyone. So Rich, a couple of ground here. But just going back to the caution. You seem to talk about inventory and your inventory management more so than projects. I'm just wondering if you have to generalize, would you say the cautions more on CapEx? Or is it more the channel partners managing inventory levels very tightly. And would you say it's U.S. versus Europe? Would you say both are in the same camp? Or would you say the U.S. is right now where you've seen the more caution?\nRichard Tobin: I think it's a U.S.-centric comment. I mean if you look at our growth rate in Europe, I don't think anybody would have modeled that considering kind of the overall caution about Europe in total, but frankly, a lot of what we do out of our production base in Europe gets -- we recognize the revenue in Europe, but it may end up around the world at the end of the day. But I think -- it's more -- we don't -- our exposure in terms of -- our exposure is larger in North America, so it's largely a North American comment. I don't -- I think that Europe, any kind of let's call it destocking would have happened during this past year because they were on the front end of the curve.\nNigel Coe: Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just you mentioned free cash flow more loaded to the first half of the year, which is obviously very unusual. You mentioned that the bulk of your excess inventories were material. So that doesn't seem to have an impact on your fixed cost absorption. But I'm wondering as you go through the inventory management, are you expecting there to be some margin penalty as you build inventories?\nRichard Tobin: No. Actually, I think that in our models, it's a margin credit as we liquidate it because if you look at forwards based on when we bought that inventory sequentially grew 2022. It's actually -- and you can see it in our margins in some of the sectors, that's part and parcel to this price cost. Look, at the end of the day, yes. If I go back and look over the last couple of years, we made a significant investment in inventory and that allowed us to deliver revenue growth that was above expectation. So now lead times and availability and capacity is repaired itself. So we get almost a triple effect of -- we liquidate kind of the excess raw materials that we've been carrying to meet demand because we slowed down production in Q4, our payables balance dropped significantly. So from a net working capital point of view, we got the negative of shipping heavily in Q4. So there's a big receivable balance that gets liquidated build probably in the latter half of Q1, but more in Q2, our payables expand and then we collect on that receivables balance. So all three come in, in the first half.\nNigel Coe: Makes sense. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe, Rich, you'd mentioned mix once or twice as a factor, and we can obviously see that impact in DPPS as well documented. I just wanted to circle back to the DII segment. There was a mixed tailwind, I think, in fourth quarter possible headwind in the year ahead guided and that's weighing on the margins there. Maybe expand a little bit on that. And DEP had an exceptional margin expansion, albeit off an easy base. Is there anything much moving around on mix in DEP?\nRichard Tobin: In DEP, no, I think rightly, I would look at DEP sequentially as opposed to comp, right? We all know what happened in Q4 of 2022. So that's why we had been saying all year that not to worry because as price cost rolls forward, you're going to get what you get. But I would look at DEP on a sequential basis as a precursor of what you can expect into 2023. And the other question you had was on marking and coding, right?\nJulian Mitchell: Yes.\nRichard Tobin: That is just a function of the amount of consumables we shipped in any given period, meaning the more that you ship in printers, that is negative to margins. The more that you ship in consumables, it's positive. It's going to bounce around. I think that our comment that we made on that particular business is that the margins are quite robust, and it's all about what kind of revenue growth we can get from here. We're not calling it down for 2023.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on kind of firm-wide Dover operating margin. So I think the operating margin overall was flattish in 2022. It's guided maybe to grow a little bit in 2023. I just wondered with that backdrop, is there the appetite maybe to accelerate restructuring spend. I saw in your guide, you've got kind of $0.10, I think, for 2023 after $0.20 last year. But I wondered just sort of thinking ahead, is there maybe the appetite to drive -- make sure that 2024, let's say, has stronger margin expansion and that might require more restructuring this year.\nRichard Tobin: Well, Julian, I mean, I think to the extent that we have flat margins despite the fact that our biopharma business, which is clearly our most profitable portion of the portfolio being down, one could argue that once we get to the strong -- we get through this destocking period, which we expect to be an H1 2023 event is that inflect back to the positive that the incremental margins that we're going to see there. And all things being equal, we hold and continuing to improve the balance of the portfolio that, that by itself is margin accretion. But I think I would call your attention to what we've done in Climate & Sustainability. We think that that's got room to run. We think that we've gotten DPPS we've just talked about. I think we've got some growth there. and we've got the return of biopharma in the second half of the year, which by I'll repeat myself, I don't think we've been overly ambitious with that. We think we're going to keep that in our back pocket and see how the market develops. And the roll forward on the Engineered Products, if we look at what our exit rate is and we roll that forward, I think that's quite healthy from a margin point of view. So back to the restructuring. Look, we're always scouring our fixed costs around here. Our management is incentivized to deliver fixed cost reduction and incremental margins. So I would expect we'll continue to do so, but I don't see any need to accelerate it to protect our performance going forward.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. The top bridge shows our quarterly organic revenue growth of 9% driven by increases in four of our five segments. As expected FX was a substantial headwind at 5% or $94 million and impacted both revenue growth and profitability. FX headwinds resulted in Q4 and full year 2022 negative EPS impacts of $0.10 and $0.35 respectively. Recent euro gains against dollar have reduced our forecasted FX headwinds in 2023, which we currently estimate at $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year EPS. M&A contributed $58 million to the top line in the quarter, a product of $80 million from acquisitions partially offset by $22 million from divestitures late in 2021. We saw a strong organic growth across most of our geographies in the quarter. The U.S. our largest market was up 7% organically, Europe was up 19% organically driven by particular strength in polymer processing, beverage can making, natural refrigerate systems and heat exchangers. All of Asia was down 1%. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia declined by about 10% in Q4, driven by short term impacts from the COVID resurgence. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to foreign exchange, translation and normalizing lead times across several businesses. Now on our cash flow statement on page, slide 7. Free cash flow for the year came in at $585 million, down year-over-year on increased capital expenditures, onetime tax payments and investments and working capital supporting growth. At our current earnings margin, we would expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 13% of revenue in an average year. 2022 free cash flow lagged behind that level, due primarily to elevate a working capital investment striving two thirds of the gap. As previously discussed, our view -- we view incremental investment in inventory over the past two years as productive despite its carrying cost enabling us to deliver 17% cumulative organic top line growth and over 30% growth in absolute EBITDA between 2019 and 2022. We are now focused on extracting back cash invested in inventory. As supply chain is improved in the fourth quarter, we began reducing inventory particularly finished goods. The majority of excess we carry into 2023 is in raw materials and we expect to consume a significant portion of that excess in the first half of the year. In addition to inventory reductions, we expect to collect elevated receivables from the fourth quarter and normalize our payable balances driving significant improvement in working capital in 2023. We also forecast lower CapEx followed following a stepped up cap next year in 2022. As a result, our forecast for 2023 free cash flow is between 15% and 17% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks Jack. Let's get started with the performance highlights on Slide 3. Dover delivered strong organic revenue growth of 9% and margin improvement of 150 basis points in the fourth quarter. Volume mix, price cost and prior period cost reduction actions all contributed to the positive performance. As we've been forecasting throughout 2021, the relationship between supply chain constraints and bookings has continued to play out into Q4. The majority of the labor and component availability and logistics constraints have dissipated resulting in production lead times returning to pre pandemic levels. Importantly, our 4% annualized through cycle organic bookings growth rate reflects the continued secular demand strength across our businesses. Our order backlog remains elevated compared to normal levels, and provides us with a good topline visibility going into [Indiscernible]. Our continuous efforts to improve productivity and efficiency principally enabled by advances we achieved in e-commerce adoption, back office consolidation and SKU or SKU complexity reduction, resulted in robust margin accretion in the quarter. We expect benefits from our research efforts to further accrue in 2023. We continue to deploy capital toward portfolio improvement, organic growth and production efficiency in 2022. Our capital expenditures in 2022 were the highest in recent Dover history and we continue to invest in manufacturing productivity projects and proactive capacity expansions to fuel our top line growth and margin improvement capabilities. We also completed five attractive bolt-on acquisitions in 2022 that provide exposure to high growth technologies and end markets and finally, we took the opportunity to return capital to our shareholders, including the completion of our 500 million accelerated share repurchase, which was completed in quarter four. We entered 2023 with a constructive stance. Demand trends remain healthy across a portfolio and we have a significant volume of business in backlog entering to the New Year. Expected revenue growth price actions and productivity measures from 2022 lay the foundation for margin accretion in 2023 have high confidence in Dover's end markets, flexible business model and proven execution playbook continuing to deliver earnings growth. Our strategy for robust through cycle shareholder value creation remains unchanged, to combine solid and consistent growth above GDP, strong operational execution generating meaningful margin accretion over time, and value added discipline capital deployment. As a result of this, we are forecasting for -- guided revenue guidance of 3% to 5% Organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $8.85 to $9.05. I'll skip slide 4, and let's move on to Slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 16% in the quarter continuing the trend of double-digit top line growth through the year. Revenue growth was broad based across the portfolio of particular strength in North America. Margins continued the sequential build throughout the year finishing -- 20% at 620 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by improving supply chains and price cost dynamics products mix as well as events investments and productivity initiatives. Clean Energy & Fueling finished the quarter and the year roughly flat on organic basis. Revenue performance for the quarter was up and clean energy components. Vehicle wash, fuel transport and below-ground retail fuel, offsetting the comparable declined a dispenser and EMV card readers in the period. Margins in the quarter were up 170 basis points on positive price cost and the mix impact from both organic, inorganic investments that we made in clean energy components and vehicle wash. This was augmented by further cost reduction actions initiatives in the third quarter, and the full, the full year carry over these actions will continue to accrue in 2023. In Imaging & Identification, volumes for our marking and coding printers, spare parts and consumables were strong in all geographies, with the exception of near term softness in China due to the COVID impact. Our software businesses continue to perform well with penetration of key customer brand accounts with strong growth in SaaS portion of our serialization software. FX remained negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in the segment given its large base of non-US dollar revenue. Q4 margins in Imaging & ID were very strong at 25% improving 250 basis points on stronger volumes, pricing actions and products product mix richness. This business has delivered exemplary margin improvement in the last few year years as it utilizes our productivity tools for e-commerce back office consolidation and offshore engineering. Pumps & Process Solutions was up 4% organically for the year but posted a 4% decline in the fourth quarter driven principally by post-COVID transition in the biopharma space. The non-COVID biopharma business has continued to grow and our overall biopharma business as well above its pre-pandemic level. New orders for biopharma connectors reflected positively in the fourth quarter after several quarters of sequential declines. All other business this segment posted solid organic growth in the fourth quarter with particular strength in polymer processing equipment and precision components in the back of improved conditions in energy markets. Operating margin for the quarter was 29% is comparable revenue mix of products delivered. Top line in Climate & Sustainability technologies continued its double digit growth in the fourth quarter posted 27% organic growth across all business geographies. Demand trends remain particularly robust in heat exchangers and CO2 refrigeration systems driven by the global investments in sustainability. Our capacity expansion programs in both these businesses remain on schedule and will continue to allow us to continue to meet growing customer demand. Margins are up 450 basis points in the quarter and over 300 basis points for the full year on improved productivity in food, retail and strong volume growth and good mix of product delivered. I'll pass it on to Brad here. Okay, I'm on slide 8. I'll be brief on this slide since we've been discussing the linkages between bookings, backlog and revenue and expected trajectory of these metrics for nearly two years. First to remind everyone that in 2021 bookings of $9.4 billion driven by post-COVID demand surge, as well as constrained supply chains the required customers drew order in advance were roughly 20% higher than our revenue that year resulting in an unprecedented backlog that requires time to ship and unwind while bookings normalize. Importantly, concerns about double ordering and cancellations did not materialize. And we have been depleting the backlog in an orderly fashion as product lead times improved. If we smooth out the post pandemic surge in bookings our bookings CAGR has been 4% from 2019 to 2022. Let's go to Slide 9 here, we show the growth and margin outlook by segment for 2023. that underpin our guidance. We expect Engineered Products to remain solid. Pent-up demand and automation initiatives and waste hauling support our robust outlook. Despite high demand, our refuse collection vehicles shipments in 2022 is still has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to chassis availability. After an excellent performance in vehicle services group in Q4 we expect a slower start in 2023 and Engineered Products is forecast to improve margins in 2023 on solid volumes benefits from our recent productivity capital investments taking hold and positive call price cost tailwinds. Clean Energy & Fueling is expected to grow single digits organically which we expect to be second half weighted due to demand for dispensers during the year. Dispenser bookings beginning to normalize, we expect Q1 to be the trough for the business with gradual recovery through the remainder of the year. All other businesses in the segment are positioned well for growth in 2023, with particular strength in our clean energy components. For the year we expect margin improvements in Clean Energy & Fueling and volume recovery, improved mix and recently enacted restructuring actions and above ground fueling. Imaging & ID is expected to continue its trajectory steady GDP growth and attractive margins. We see robust demand for new printers and components and consumables and professional services the outlook for the bulk serialization and brand protection software is also strong. Margin as business are robust and we expect them to remain as such to 2023. We project flat organic growth in pumps and process solutions. Our industrial pumps and plastics and polymers, precision components and thermo connector businesses are all positioned for solid growth. The biopharma components business is expect to hit its bottom in volume and margin in the first quarter as customers worked through and repurpose excess inventory. We are beginning to see encouraging signs and bookings for our biopharma connectors, and our full year forecasts may prove to be conservative. The long-term tailwinds of single use components for biological drug manufacture remain compelling. And importantly, our products are specified for regulated manufacturing of therapies with attractive growth outlook. And we continue to win new specifications and an active pipeline of new biologic and cell and gene therapies. Margin performance is expected to be roughly flat for the year with a sequentially lower level in the first and second quarters on unfavorable product mix from slower biopharma and geographic mix from higher sales in China, for plastics and polymers. Growth outlook for climate and sustainability technologies remain solid as our businesses continue to ship against strong backlog levels. We are forecasting continued double-digit growth in both natural refrigerant systems and heat exchangers for heat pumps. Our beverage can making businesses booked well into 2023 and expect continued margin improvement in 2023 on volume conversion, productivity gains and mix. Move on to Slide 10. Here we show our recent performance against our capital allocation priorities, our priorities to reinvest in our business, which represents the highest return on investment. 2022 represented a recent record for CapEx with numerous capacity expansions and productivity investments completed. We will continue our efforts to add attractive bolt-on acquisitions to improve our portfolio by entering new markets with secular growth. We invested $325 million into five highly attractive acquisitions in 2022. We're carrying significant firepower in a compelling M&A pipeline into 2023. Finally, as we did in 2022, we will return excess liquidity to our shareholders through increased dividends and opportunistic. Let's move onto Slide 11. For the wrap up, before we get into our full year guidance I'll make a few comments on our view of the macro environment and how we believe the year may develop. First and foremost, we hope that the Fed is cautious going forward from here. We support the efforts to tackle inflation, which had had a large hand in causing but we are in the camp that believes the Fed has gone far enough and the lagged effect of the further actions can be problematic to economic growth. Market participants are likely to be cautious with the timing of their demand generating decisions as there is a recognition that manufacturing lead times and logistics constraints have been largely repaired. And as such, we expect first quarter demand to reflect this cautious stance. We expect seasonality to the year to be weighted towards quarters two and three in revenue and earnings and weighted to H1 for cash flow as our balance sheet reflects liquidation of inventory and receivables from 2022. Despite the uncertain macro, our goals remain ambitious, we will push hard to win our share of demand. We have done a lot of work to improve the performance of our products and we believe we would have the right to win. We have proactively expanded capacity to meet projected demand and areas of the portfolio with significant secular growth opportunities. So now let me put our guide in EPS performance of the longer term perspective. Our objectives delivered double-digit through cycle EPS growth for our investors through a balanced mix of healthy revenue growth, margin accretion, value creative capital deployment. We have been delivering on that equipment that had led to that commitment, and we drive will continue to drive to continue to do so. I want to thank our customers for trusting Dover businesses to deliver on their important needs. And I'm grateful to Dover teams across the world for continuing to serve our customers and execute well despite various challenges along the road. That's completes the comments. So Jack, let's go to questions. I think that the feedback that we're getting from our customers is to start off the year cautiously. I think that there's in a lot of portions of the marketplace, there's inventory that needs to be depleted. And I think that there's a concern about the macro. There also is this view that inflation is coming down, and that being prudent about when to start projects is probably going to put them in the money. Furthermore, I think they have a difficult comp in Q1 just because of FX alone. So I don't think there's anything other than as we mentioned, biopharma meeting, getting to the bottom where we expect orders to inflect positively from there. I think it's just an overly cautious stance going into the New Year. Everybody knows that lead times have been prepared -- have been repaired. So it's not as if they have to put the orders in and take and take the deliveries in Q1. So it will actually go back to what had been historically the seasonality of the Dover portfolio, where a little bit of a slow start second quarter and third quarter quite high and then we run for cash in Q4. No. I mean, from a supply standpoint, we are not overly levered towards China with the exception of electronic components, which don't make a disproportionate high amount of our purchases. So no, I don't I think that China, we the stance is it's going to get better from here, not worse. Welcome. Well, a lot of that depends on the macro, Jeff at the end of the day. But yes, I mean, yes, we would expect to go back there. I would call your attention to the slide that we had at the end of Q3 that showed normal backlogs by segment. We would expect to go back there. If 19 is normal. Let's say, I think that's what the comparison, comparative number there is. We would expect it to go back there. But it may flex over time. And well, again, I'll leave it at that. It will go back to I would call your attention to that slide. And that's where we're going to end up. Yes, we've been pretty disciplined in terms of not repricing our backlog. For sure. So I don't expect any issues there that are not manageable. I think that what we can expect at the beginning of this year is everybody having a view -- we're not and this includes us when we deal with our own suppliers that inflation is coming down. And if I, if I spend some time in Q1 renegotiating maybe I can force the issue to a certain extent. So in our estimates, we don't have any unannounced pricing that's not out in the marketplace, meaning that's not baked into our numbers, another price increase in the June time period. But it's going to be it's, it's going to be interesting to see how it develops over time. I think it's going to be reflected more in a delay in terms of the order rates, until we get into a position of back and forth of do you -- when do you need the product and when do you have to stop negotiating the price? Yes. Yes. Our estimates are price cost positive for the year based on roll forward, what basically what you see in Q4. You're welcome. Good morning. Well, a lot of them are based on their own CapEx plan. So as we as we talked about in the end of Q4 about the decline in dispensers it was kind of interesting to us because we were shipping heavily in the below ground and hardly shipping anything and above ground. And that was a reflection of the delay in getting these projects done because of supply chain constraints and labor and everything else. I think that we're going to see a little, that's an example. We're going to see a little bit of that more in Q1. Right? So despite having the backlog, the customers are not saying, what, deliver it on January 1, and I'll go put it in the warehouse, and I'll pull it out when I want. They just don't feel the need. That's what was kind of going on in the marketplace to a certain extent, for a period of time. As that accordion effect is beginning to unwind. Yes, the backlog is there, but they're saying, what, here's the timing of my project, and I may want it in March. I may want it in April. So the depletion will be orderly over the balance of the year. I don't think that we disclose that, but it's a good portion of the organic growth is price. Let me do it in my head. Yes, that's, that's close. Yes. It gets very much it's going to be very much contingent of what happens in the long cycle portion of the business, right? The Maags and the Belvac and to a certain extent, SWEP, which is becoming a long-cycle business, because we're beginning to rather than sell the products and selling capacity. So if those three hang in there, then yes, that's what that's all be. Correct. Thanks. Hey Joe. Joe, I don't have Excel open here in front of me. I'd like to just -- look at the end of the day this is just a general statement about the feedback that we're getting from the marketplace, right. Everybody's concerned about recession. And so there's a bias towards being very careful with inventory also included. So we just think that the take off is back to the question that Steve asked before is that the backlog is there, but the take rate on that backlog should start out slowly, right, until everybody gets in place where we can, a lot of what we deliver goes right to the project site. And a lot of cases least the businesses that are tethered to distribution. So I'm, I'm not calling for a collapse in Q1 by any stretch of the margin. But, but we don't want to do it, the only reason that we're calling it out is we're coming out of periods where we had very strong Q1s in the seasonality versus the past got a little bit out of whack. So we're just telling you to just be careful with Q1, the full year is the full year. And we're confident in that. But I think they just we have to be, we have to recognize that is an amount of caution in the marketplace. And everybody's going to be very careful about how much inventory they lay in until they can see what's going on with kind of the macro, per se. I think all of the $0.23 was not in clean energy. I think $0.19 of the $0.23 if I remember correctly, more or less is in there. Yes. And some of that was in the fourth quarter also because we actually took the cost actions in Q3 But everything is on track. What you do as you get -- you get a bad comp in that business because it was still delivering pretty heavily in Q1, but we expect that to be offset by clean energy components and below ground and car wash, which are margin accretive. So you get basically over the year, a positive inflection of mix on the portfolio, but I think you just have to be a little bit careful in Q1 just because the above ground is a bad comp. Thanks. Yes. Well, we did take cost out as volume came out of the sector for sure, and we did that progressively through the year. And I think we took a further action in the end of Q3, Q4, more or less. Look, orders are beginning to inflect. We are paying a lot of attention to the commentary of our customers out there who are basically saying it's an H1 event and then expect to have all the inventory cleared. I will tell you that we have not been overly ambitious in our estimates for the full year. So I think if we're going to -- I think that we may have a little bit more difficult H1, but I think that we've got a better and even chance to have a better-than-expected performance in the second half of the year. But what we'd like to see is the order rates come up and us start expanding capacity to deal with it, which I think we can turn around to do it. So yes, the flat margins year-over-year. We're going to have to be really careful with our cost controls, and we're going to have to deliver polymers and plastics and precision components are going to have to deliver on the volume that we expect to get out of those businesses. But it's not like we're being overly ambitious in volume in biopharma for the year. Well, I mean that's going to be part of it Andy, at the end of the day. So let's not the card before the horse, but we're going to basically do what we did back in 2019 and try to give you a 3-year forward role by segment and what we think the contributing factors to it. I mean a lot of it is going to be on-going productivity, but I think what's underestimated is that the organic revenue potential is underestimated. And I think we've done a lot of work in terms of mix here. So the mix of the products that we have today versus what we started with in 2020 is, I think, a lot different than that was back then. So it's not some ambitious we're going to grow completely out of the order. I think we'll grow higher than basically the market expects us because we generally get bottom quartile expected growth rates and revenue, but I think mix is going to be the most important aspect of it. I don't know yet. Good morning, Scott. Well, I guess taking on any leverage to do a deal has not been well received by anybody. So I guess we'd have to be careful with a larger deal presently for whatever reason, the capital markets are not looking kindly on leverage for, I guess, the reasons we can understand about unsurety of the macro going forward. But yes, I think that what we've seen so far is that a realistic multiples are now becoming -- are reflective of what's going on in the capital markets. So you always have -- most of our deals are private, as you know, private companies. There's always a lag between the public capital markets at a private valuation. I think that, that has narrowed towards to the public capital markets. Yes, I'm not allowed to say that the AP, right because the CTAs love to pick up on that step. But yes, look, I mean, it is a cyclical business and there are investment cycles and part and parcel is to not over capacitize yourself as the cycle goes up and the recapture on the spare parts, which are margin accretive on the way down. So that's the way that we look at the business. Now having said that, it will be interesting to see what happens with PET in drinks going forward. I know that there's been a little bit of a pushback on ESG lately. But the fact of the matter is that PET from an environmental point of view is not a preferred option. So to the extent that the cost plus ESG aspect of PET over time make aluminum more attractive, then we could -- that is by far the largest portion of the market. So even if a recapture rate of 15% of PET market would drive another cycle. So that's kind of where we are right now. Thanks. Good morning. Yes. I wouldn't expect to run into the logistics constraints that we've seen. I think that was a one-off. I mean, you had just such a collapse of the macro and then a restart and then add a lot of the energy markets went haywire which drove the logistics market say, well, I don't expect that to happen. I mean I think that capacity was brought on. And if you look at logistics costs and the forward curves there, I don't expect that to repeat under any reasonable macro scenario from here. I think there is a lot of liquidity that's being taken from the general market. I think that lending is very low right now. It's very difficult to get loans and secure loans -- secure liquidity to run businesses out there. I'm not making it a Dover comment. I'm talking in total. So I'm concerned about that. And if that's the case, and there's the only way that if you're a private company, the only way you can generate liquidity in order to continue to fund yourself is to draw down inventory balances to extremely low levels, and that's negative to orders and revenue going forward. So that's our overall concern of -- I don't see the point of bringing out another 50 basis points only to turn around and give the 50 basis points back into Q4. Why bother? Why can't we just sit where we're standing right here because liquidity in the market is incredibly tight right now. So that's the fear. At the end of the day is that you have a delayed CapEx cycle, which we ascribe to the fact that there is a CapEx need out there because of productivity to offset higher labor costs, and then you've got all the stimulus money out there. But fact of the matter is there's no liquidity to accompany that I think that you have a delay effect that could be problematic. No, that's exactly what we think, and we think it's going to continue through Q1. And then from there, we expect based on our view of the demand cycle that it will inflect positively from there. But I think you're going to get another quarter of exactly how you described it, right? I know I can get the product. I have enough inventory to carry me through the quarter. I'm going to take the chance of depleting it because I know you can deliver into Q2. Thanks. Hi, good morning. Well, I would leave that to the Investor Day, right? I mean, I think that my comment was is that -- we went through this period of EMV and then we went through this period of the overhype EV taking over the world, and we were basically saying that we believe that we can position this business to harvest profits for 20 years. And I think that we're -- we've made the moves in Q3 of this year to begin to position ourselves appropriately there, right? So there was no sense of doing it in advance of a rising revenue curve. But now that it flattens out, we've got to run the business differently on one hand. And on the other hand, we've been a pretty active acquirer in that particular segment as we transition to clean energy exposure, particularly in the hydrogen space. So we're doing it -- but I would -- if you're looking for, what does that mean going forward from here in a holistic way, why don't we wait until March and we'll surely talk about it. Why don't we take this off-line because everybody's got a different calculation of if it's -- I think that there was 20% of the annual revenue should be in backlog in a normal time. So we got what our forecast is for revenue for this year. So it's a relatively easy calculation. I think it's a U.S.-centric comment. I mean if you look at our growth rate in Europe, I don't think anybody would have modeled that considering kind of the overall caution about Europe in total, but frankly, a lot of what we do out of our production base in Europe gets -- we recognize the revenue in Europe, but it may end up around the world at the end of the day. But I think -- it's more -- we don't -- our exposure in terms of -- our exposure is larger in North America, so it's largely a North American comment. I don't -- I think that Europe, any kind of let's call it destocking would have happened during this past year because they were on the front end of the curve. No. Actually, I think that in our models, it's a margin credit as we liquidate it because if you look at forwards based on when we bought that inventory sequentially grew 2022. It's actually -- and you can see it in our margins in some of the sectors, that's part and parcel to this price cost. Look, at the end of the day, yes. If I go back and look over the last couple of years, we made a significant investment in inventory and that allowed us to deliver revenue growth that was above expectation. So now lead times and availability and capacity is repaired itself. So we get almost a triple effect of -- we liquidate kind of the excess raw materials that we've been carrying to meet demand because we slowed down production in Q4, our payables balance dropped significantly. So from a net working capital point of view, we got the negative of shipping heavily in Q4. So there's a big receivable balance that gets liquidated build probably in the latter half of Q1, but more in Q2, our payables expand and then we collect on that receivables balance. So all three come in, in the first half. Thanks. In DEP, no, I think rightly, I would look at DEP sequentially as opposed to comp, right? We all know what happened in Q4 of 2022. So that's why we had been saying all year that not to worry because as price cost rolls forward, you're going to get what you get. But I would look at DEP on a sequential basis as a precursor of what you can expect into 2023. And the other question you had was on marking and coding, right? That is just a function of the amount of consumables we shipped in any given period, meaning the more that you ship in printers, that is negative to margins. The more that you ship in consumables, it's positive. It's going to bounce around. I think that our comment that we made on that particular business is that the margins are quite robust, and it's all about what kind of revenue growth we can get from here. We're not calling it down for 2023. Well, Julian, I mean, I think to the extent that we have flat margins despite the fact that our biopharma business, which is clearly our most profitable portion of the portfolio being down, one could argue that once we get to the strong -- we get through this destocking period, which we expect to be an H1 2023 event is that inflect back to the positive that the incremental margins that we're going to see there. And all things being equal, we hold and continuing to improve the balance of the portfolio that, that by itself is margin accretion. But I think I would call your attention to what we've done in Climate & Sustainability. We think that that's got room to run. We think that we've gotten DPPS we've just talked about. I think we've got some growth there. and we've got the return of biopharma in the second half of the year, which by I'll repeat myself, I don't think we've been overly ambitious with that. We think we're going to keep that in our back pocket and see how the market develops. And the roll forward on the Engineered Products, if we look at what our exit rate is and we roll that forward, I think that's quite healthy from a margin point of view. So back to the restructuring. Look, we're always scouring our fixed costs around here. Our management is incentivized to deliver fixed cost reduction and incremental margins. So I would expect we'll continue to do so, but I don't see any need to accelerate it to protect our performance going forward. You're welcome."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please, go ahead, sir.\nJack Dickens: Thank you, Gretchen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through November 10, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information, and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: All right. Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the performance highlights on slide three. Dover delivered revenue growth and margin improvement in the third quarter, driven by rigorous execution and improving price/cost dynamics that were offset -- that more than offset the impact of supply chain challenges, inflationary cost pressures and foreign currency translation. Demand remains constructive across most of the portfolio with four out of five segments posting organic growth in the quarter. Backlog at $3.2 billion was up 12% year-over-year and remains approximately double the historical levels relative to revenue, driven by continued strong demand across many end markets. The supply chain challenges that we've endured over the past 18 months continued to improve, which has allowed us to reduce our backlog this quarter through increased production performance. It is our expectation that this trend will continue for the balance of the year as supply chains and lead times normalize. Despite the building macroeconomic uncertainty, we are deploying capital to drive productivity and expand capacity in several businesses that are expected to deliver robust growth on secular tailwinds. We closed on the Malema Engineering acquisition in July, which adds a great technology to our biopharma portfolio, and we are continuing to pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions. During the quarter, we also announced an accelerated share repurchase program to return $500 million of excess capital to shareholders, while preserving sufficient liquidity for value-creating investments. While current demand conditions are solid, our management posture reflects growing caution with the macroeconomic outlook. As such, for the balance of the year, we'll be proactively reducing output in several businesses to draw down inventory balances and initiating cost-containment measures where appropriate. Our business model is flexible, as our 2020 performance has proven. We firmly believe that ongoing improvements in the supply chain and available production capacity will allow us to match production to meet demand within prevailing lead times in Q1 of 2023. We are adjusting our full year guidance to reflect the negative translation impact of foreign exchange on our revenue and earnings. The estimated full year impact of foreign exchange to EPS is approximately $0.37 per share with notable acceleration during the third quarter as the dollar rallied against most of our trading currencies. Let's skip slide 4 and move on to slide 5. All-in-all, the quarter developed as we expected. The capital goods portions of the portfolio delivered strong top line and margin expansion on the back of strong order books, lower input costs cycling through inventory, as well as pricing actions taking hold. Engineered Products revenue was up 18% organically in the quarter on broad-based strength across the portfolio in major geographies as well as pricing actions. Margins were up 250 basis points year-over-year as our capital investments and productivity begin to show results and our investments in e-commerce platforms drive aftermarket volume. We expect margins to continue their upward trajectory through the balance of the year on solid volumes and improving price/cost dynamics. Clean Energy & Fueling was roughly flat on an organic basis. Revenue performance was up in clean energy components, vehicle wash, fuel transport and below-ground retail fueling, but was offset by lower shipments and order trends in above ground retail fueling, driven by customer construction delays in North America, as well as overall caution among operators in Europe and Asia as a result of the weakening macro environment. Margins in the quarter were flat year-over-year as our clean energy margin mix and decisive cost actions were able to offset the reduced volumes and fixed cost absorption in the above ground dispenser business. During this quarter, we began to take fixed cost reduction actions in our dispenser business that were in part enabled by the global product platform harmonization and complexity reduction work that we've completed in the past 12 months, which enabled us to reduce our European dispenser SKUs offering by over 50%. These actions will continue through the first half of 2023 and will result in meaningfully improved operating margins going forward. In Imaging & Identification, volumes for our marking and coding printers and spare parts recovered well on improving electronics input availability as well as the roll-off of COVID lockdowns in China from the prior quarter. Pricing actions and consumables and service demand were positive contributors in the quarter. FX is a negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in this segment given its large base of non-US dollar revenue. Q3 margins in Imaging & ID were very strong, improving 230 basis points, driven by pricing actions, product mix richness and improved operational efficiency. Pumps & Process Solutions posted 2% organic growth. We saw solid performance in industrial pumps, medical and thermal connectors, polymer processing and recycling and precision components. As expected, the biopharma components business, which delivered peak revenue in Q3 last year on COVID vaccine demand, declined year-over-year in the quarter as the biopharma industry continues to pivot from COVID vaccines to a growing suite of biologic therapies. Our non-biomedical and thermal connector business has grown 30% year-to-date, driven largely by demand in data center and electrical vehicle charger cooling applications. On the back of this demand and forecasted demand, we are finalizing the commissioning of a new assembly plant in the Minneapolis area in Q4. Operating margin in the quarter remained robust at approximately 30% despite a larger proportion of revenues from industrial products and from improved volumes, pricing and efficiency programs across the segment. Top line in Climate & Sustainable Technologies continued to be strong, posting 19% organic growth on solid volume and pricing actions across all businesses and geographies. All three businesses have significant backlogs into 2023. Our capacity expansion programs and CO2 systems and heat exchangers remain on schedule as we continue to invest behind areas of secular growth beyond 2022. Margins were up 500 basis points in the quarter on price and strong volumes, materially improved productivity in food retail as a result of capital deployment projects and product complexity reduction and improved portfolio mix in can-making equipment and spares and heat exchangers. I'll pass it to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. The top bridge shows our organic revenue growth of 9%, driven by increases in four of our five segments. FX was substantial at 5% or a $97 million headwind to our revenue growth as well as our profitability, resulting in $0.11 of negative EPS impact in the quarter. Changes in foreign currency translation from our last guide in July until today are estimated to have an incremental impact of approximately $0.10 to our full year EPS. M&A contributed $55 million to the top line in the quarter, a product of $89 million from acquisitions, partially offset by $34 million from a divestiture late last year. We saw solid organic growth across our major geographies. The US, our largest market, was up 11% organically in the quarter. Europe was up 9%, and all of Asia was up 13%. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia, posted 8% organic growth this quarter, up from a 4% decline last quarter as our businesses recovered from COVID-driven lockdowns that impacted our ability to produce and sell in the country. On the bottom of the chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to foreign currency translation and improved lead times across several businesses. Our cash flow statement is on Slide 7. Free cash flow through the first three quarters of the year sits at approximately $300 million, down year-over-year on capital expenditures investment, timing of tax payments and performance payments, but mostly on planned investments in working capital. We have been carrying elevated raw materials and components inventory levels throughout the year, reflective of our high backlog levels and input shortages as well as higher receivable balances on growing sales. We are actively working to bring down our inventory through the balance of the year and expect to further liquidate our working capital position with the degree of cash generation also dependent on the timing of collection of receivables. We expect free cash flow generation to significantly improve in the fourth quarter, which is historically our highest cash flow quarter of the year. However, the exact timing of working capital liquidation may take into early 2023. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Thanks, Brad. Let's move to Slide 8. Let's discuss the battleground items for the balance of 2022 with a brand-new slide, demand trends and backlog. More than a year ago, we were clear that we expected comparable booking metrics to moderate when supply chains start normalizing, and that's the story of the quarter. Bookings were down on a year-to-year basis against a very high comparable quarter, and backlog declined this quarter as a result of improved production performance, which drove the top line. I call your attention to the middle column of the slide. Our backlog remains at historically high levels, about double where it was relative to sales prior to the pandemic. This is driven to a lesser extent now by extended lead times and customer placing post-pandemic orders much further in advance than normal as a result of supply chain and industrial capacity constraints, but more importantly, by strength of fundamental demand of our products and solutions in multiple markets that are indicated with green arrows on the slide. We've talked about secular growth drivers in some of these markets previously, and we continue to see robust near-term trends driving investment in these businesses. Despite strong demand, shipments were held back in the quarter in several businesses, most notably in Engineered Products, due to hydraulic component shortages and chassis availability and in Climate & Sustainability due to subcomponents availability and capacity constraints. We are currently expanding capacity in both CO2 systems in the United States and heat exchangers in four different geographies to meet projected demand. The portions highlighted in orange, we expected to some degree, but above ground fueling weakened in the third quarter as our customers have not been able to overcome short-term construction delays, pushing new builds into 2023. And the biopharma transition from the COVID vaccine production has taken longer than we would expect. We expect both to normalize as we move into 2023 based on inventory drawdowns and reconfirmed CapEx plans. All-in-all, our backlog remains elevated, and we will continue to support the top line. Additionally, our backlogs give us confidence and visibility to plan our production efficiently, and as I mentioned earlier, will allow us to manage our working capital by flexing production performance to quarterly demand. Today, about 70% of our Q4 revenue is already booked, and we have a solid foundation of book business carrying to 2023 that you can see on the slide by segment, highlighting the healthy mix of short and long-cycle elements of the portfolio. Let's go to the bridge on slide 9. Here shows sources of value creation that lead to our forecast double-digit EPS growth this year. We expect to significantly offset much of the $0.37 of FX headwind this year through strong execution and cost controls. We are conducting short-term cost containment measures where appropriate, but more importantly, we are beginning some fundamental cost actions in our Clean Energy & Fueling segment. The 2023 full year EPS accretion from these actions is expected to -- expected at approximately $0.23 per share. We have additional cost actions underway, which we'll update on the Q4 call. Between our current in-flight restructuring activities and the share repurchases completed this year, we expect a solid foundation of EPS carryover benefit into 2023. As we prepare for various macroeconomic scenarios next year, we are confident in our portfolio's ability to outgrow and out-execute in our respective markets. The niche markets that we participate in are attractive and structurally sound from a competitive point of view. Our investments in back-office consolidation, e-commerce platforms and product line complexity reductions are providing us a multiyear runway to further reduce our fixed cost structure and variable costs while enriching the customer experience. Through organic and inorganic growth, we have rescaled Dover since the spin in 2018, which provides us increased optionality for the portfolio decisions as we continue our value creation journey. In closing, I'd like to recognize that we've been pushing our group hard this year, and I want to thank my colleagues around the globe for their continued dedication and strong performance in a demanding operating environment. And with that, Jack, we'll go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So you took down the total revenue by 1%. I don't know, that's like maybe $0.10 or something like that of headwind, depending on how you convert it. You have some buyback benefit here that's pretty close to that. So what's the other part of the reduction in earnings? Is there anything else that's moving around, or maybe I'm underestimating the impact of revenue. Maybe, you're going to the low end of the range?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, I think we're taking a guess at FX for the balance of the year, and we've been wrong all year. So there's some caution related to that. Look, at the end of the day, we're going to build what we have in our backlog. I think that we are making an adjustment to our posture somewhat in terms of production performance. Look, we've been -- you can see in our working capital balances that we've been running excess inventory all year, because we've been kind of chasing this demand curve. We've been -- we've seen notable differences and improvements on the supply chain across most of the portfolio with some few exceptions during the quarter, which allows us to change our posture of, you know what, let's turn down the production performance machine in Q4 somewhat. Let's liquidate working capital because, you know what, I'm confident that we can restart it in Q1 and push that production performance into next year. So we get the benefit of the reduced working capital this year, and we get the benefit of the production performance in 2023. I think it's the prudent thing to do. I'm not going to make any comments on what we think about 2023 demand yet. We'll wait for next quarter to do that. But clearly, we have some caution in terms of what's going to develop in the marketplace. I fundamentally disagree with what the Fed is doing now. They say that they're data-driven. But if you look at our results themselves, logistics costs, raw material costs have all come down. So the inflation that we had seen over the past 18 months is coming down. But if they are going to continue -- and they believe that they're data-driven. Well, I don't think that we've seen now the impact. We see it in housing now, the impact of increase in rates. So if they're looking for demand destruction, then we have absolutely no other posture than to accommodate that by lowering our inventory balances and moving that production into next year. So I think it's a good news, bad news story. I think we get the working capital and the cash flow this year, which under the trajectory we're on right now, we would have been pushing that working capital liquidation almost exclusively into 2023. We can pull some of that into 2022.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So basically, it's kind of like a bit of an under-absorption in the fourth quarter as you kind of turn that production down?\nRichard Tobin: That's correct.\nSteve Tusa: Said differently? Okay. And then one last one...\nRichard Tobin: Say any way you want, but that's right.\nSteve Tusa: What will price/cost end up this year? And if you kind of snap the line on all that, what does it end up looking like so far next year? I'm sure there's some -- pricing was a little bit better than expected this quarter. Maybe there's some carryover of price in the next year as well.\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. Price/cost, you can see it. We had been saying all year that in the capital goods portion of the portfolio, because of the inventory balances roll forward and because of the exposure on raw materials, that we expect the back half -- and take a look at the performance on both Engineered Products and the refrigeration unit, I mean, those are largely as a result of the dynamics that we discussed on previous calls. We don't see any pushback right now in terms of pricing, but I think that that's going to be reflective of demand we go through. And more importantly, that pricing wasn't there in the first half of this year. So if everything holds firm, we get a pretty good credit from a comp perspective going into the first half of 2023.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And that's positive price/cost next year you would expect?\nRichard Tobin: I expect to have positive price/cost in the first half of next year, assuming that demand is reasonable.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, okay. Great, thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Rich, could you talk about the cadence of orders you've been seeing? I know you recently talked about some expected weakness in above-ground fueling. You've talked today about biopharma continuing to be a little difficult. But did you see any more signs of slowing in orders toward the end of the quarter here in October? And what are your customers telling you about how they might spend on CapEx going into 2023?\nRichard Tobin: No. The only place that we've seen it are the areas that we called out specifically in the slide. Other than that, we were not seeing those robust crazy numbers that we were seeing a year-ago this time. But I mean, I think quarter-to-quarter, across the portfolio, while we're less than one, I mean we're at 0.96, it's not like we've seen a dramatic slowdown. But what we're hearing from our customers is two things. Those customers that we're providing products into CapEx are -- by and large, every CapEx project this year that our customers have undertaken have taken too long and have cost too much because of labor availability and total inflation. And so what you see now is as everybody gets more cautious about demand in 2023 that there's almost this view of, you know what, we're going to push some of this demand into 2023. We're going to finish what we got inflight, and then we're going to see where we are. That's the signal we're getting, particularly in the above-ground fueling side. On the biopharma side, I'd just call your attention to every -- all of our customers' results and will tell you that we started reducing product into the channel much earlier. And we provide a consumable product. So I wouldn't take a look at some of the systems manufacturers and say, 'Well, that's a direct proxy.' I think that we are a little bit ahead of the curve in terms of that demand. And as long as those units run, eventually, over time, they're going to consume our products. So we think that this is a margin tailwind moving into 2023. But overall, Andy, at the end of the day, you can't -- as I said to Steve a moment ago, I disagree of what the Fed is doing at this point. There's enough in the system right now that they're going to get what they want. But if they overcorrect, they're going to get demand destruction. So -- and all of our customers are now on pins and needles about that right now. So we can only do one thing, and that is to prepare for a scenario as such. And because we have a flexible operating model, I think that we just get on the front foot and do in Q4 and if we have to catch up in Q1, so be it.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Rich, that's helpful. And then maybe just focusing on DCST for a second. You mentioned you had good visibility in all three of your businesses. Obviously, there's been some concerns around Belvac. Maybe you can talk about that. And what are you seeing in sort of core retail refrigeration? And you mentioned sort of the expansion in heat exchangers. All that seems to be reflecting in -- improving margin there, too. So how do you think about margin going forward in that business?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, I think that we finally got to where we said we were going to get to. It only took five years, but I think that that's -- I guess we can hang our hat on it...\nAndy Kaplowitz: Better late than never.\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, I think we would have made it if not for the whole COVID disaster. But nonetheless, look, Belvac -- when you look at that backlog chart, a big chunk of that is Belvac, right? So it's sold well through 2023. At some point, that business is going to have to pivot to more replacement parts, but we look at it as the installed base has increased exponentially. And the margin profile of spares versus built-out units is actually accretive to margins. Goal for refrigeration, demand is still there. We'll have a little bit of a slowdown in deliveries in Q4 just because we went into the Christmas season when everybody stops doing construction projects. But our backlog there remains robust. CO2, we think we've got secular demand behind it. That's why we're expanding capacity. And the heat exchangers, look, I mean, we're expanding capacity in every geographical region. I think we talked about it before. We've been the beneficiary of a significant amount of step-up in volume for a product that goes into heat pumps. And if you look at the major manufacturers, they're all announcing capacity expansions worldwide just because of the technology change. So we feel good about it.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it, Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Rich, first, just this comment about portfolio optionality that you closed with, obviously, somewhat of a provocative statement. I know you said it at least one time earlier at a conference. I don't suppose you're going to name names on businesses or anything, but you did throw that out there. So maybe just elaborate on what you want us to think as you lay that on the table and where things might be headed?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. It's been a couple of years since we got the portfolio questions. I was missing them, Jeff. So I decided to put recommendation to restart it. Look, I mean, I think that when we used to get questions about the portfolio, part of the answer that we gave was that you can't descale to the amount that we did back in 2018 and then begin talking about portfolio because you run into a scale problem after a while. So if you remember, we spun off Apergy and we had to take some significant cost restructuring to accommodate the fact firm-wide that absorption was going to be an issue. And when we got asked questions again about bigger portfolio moves, part of the answer was, hey, look, there's a lot of value that we can create out of the existing portfolio, which we have, but also to the extent that we can rescale the portfolio, then that opens up an avenue where we don't have to worry so much about that. So that's where we are. If you take a look at where we were in terms of total revenue, pre-Apergy spin and where we're going to close now, where we've rebuilt that scale and that makes a variety of scenarios more possible on top of the fact that the portfolio in totality is worth a lot more than it was back in 2018.\nJeff Sprague: All right. Interesting. So the -- maybe just thinking about bracing for something tougher, as you said, maybe the Fed is going to take us off the cliff here. So the preparatory cost actions concentrated right now in Clean Energy & Fueling. Maybe just a little bit of color on how you would further prepare if you think things are going south, other areas of potential restructuring and what leverage you could potentially pull.\nRichard Tobin: Sure. The Clean Energy & Fueling one is a bit unique. I mean, we did -- we were a little bit surprised in Q3 when the demand went down, because all the signals that we were getting from our customers were -- that there was plenty of projects through the balance of the year. So it basically forced us taking actions that we were planning on doing in January and pulling them into Q3. I mean, we've been preparing for a scenario around the retail fueling business to adapt its position kind of in a post-EMV world, for years now, right? I mean, we spent a significant amount of money in revitalizing the portfolio. At the same time, we spent a significant amount of management time reducing the SKUs, which allows us in the future to make some broader decisions on footprint and a variety of other things. So to a certain extent, part of what we did was in reaction to the demand environment, but it was coming nonetheless. I just think that we had to pull it forward by about three or four months. On the balance of the portfolio, I could only go back to March 2020. I don't see that scenario. But I think that we've proven that if we have significant demand destruction that there are a variety of levers that we can pull, which I don't want to pull. But I think that we -- if you take a look at our performance in 2020 in terms of margin preservation, I think that we did quite well.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Maybe just one quick one. The 70% of Q4 in backlog, how does that stack up relative to normal?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, look, if our backlog is double than historic, then it's 50% more. But I mean -- but it's all over the map, depending on whether it's short cycle or long cycle. If you look at that chart, right, printing and ID has got higher backlog, but it's actually quite low relative to its revenue, because that's a consumable business. We don't generally carry any backlog there. So you're going to see a bifurcation between capital goods with longer lead times and bigger build schedules between shorter lead times. They're all up in aggregate, but there's different dynamics between the five of them.\nJeff Sprague: Right. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nRichard Tobin: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hi guys, good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Hey, just a question on backlog. We've been going to a bunch of industry shows, and it seems that some industry participants are adjusting just how they think about backlog structurally. There's a view that going forward, we will probably live with just permanently bigger backlogs, just because there's less visibility, longer lead times. At the same time, it seems that the industry also realized that maybe we've heard from some industry participants sort of protecting themselves in terms of pricing, right? So maybe there are now cancellation penalties. Can you just talk as much as you can about, A, how do you think about just this order and backlog process evolving into 2023? And given the fact that you do now have to probably live with longer backlog, even if you are reducing it, if you've sort of changed the structure of the backlog terms, conditions, pricing, anything like that, big picture? Thanks.\nRichard Tobin: Well, that's quite the tour de force. Look, there's nothing wrong with having backlog. Given the choice between having it and not having it, I'd rather have it at the end of the day. There are complexities with the issue of backlog, because you're managing pricing of the backlog. And if you recall, we suffered at the beginning of this year where we had a large backlog coming out of 2021 and then ran into cost inflation. And then we had this grand debate whether you could reprice your backlog, which is really a competitive stack issue whether you thought you could get away with it or not and everybody kind of did their thing. I think that backlogs because of kind of the supply chain risk of shortening the supply chain, which I think we've been the beneficiary of, I think that's going to have a little bit of an impact there. So -- but again, I think it's very difficult to compare company to company unless they're pure players because certain businesses are always going to have elevated backlogs in the portfolio. I mentioned Belvac, but Maag would be the same way within our portfolio, where the build time of these products is 90, 120 days. So you've got to get basically the orders -- before you even buy the subcomponents in the raw materials, you need to have the order in place as opposed to marketing Maags, where we don't get all worked up about backlog because it's just consumer volume and being able to price it correctly and make the deliveries on time. So there's a lot to unpack there, Andrew. I mean, I think because of the breadth of our portfolio, we touch it all, all the scenarios. I think that the actions that we're taking now is a little bit of caution of -- you can't look at backlog trends and then project that into 2023, right? I think that we're basically saying supply chain is caught up now. The backlog that we have that we need to deliver in the back half of Q1, we can make it in Q1 so let's not make it in Q4. That's really the pivot that we're making right now.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks. And just -- I'm sure you're going to love my next question. It's on M&A and with interest rates where they are, high-yield markets are in flux. How have you changed your approach to M&A in terms of cost of capital? And what are you seeing from PE players? Are they restricted? Anybody's willing even to do anything in this market? Just high-level discussion of what the end market -- the M&A market looks like. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Well, as you would know better than most, price discovery right now is difficult, right? Because what revenue and what demand is going to be in 2023 is anybody's option. And then you've got this whole issue of, boy, I could have sold this thing 18 months ago and got this crazy multiple, and now I can't have it anymore. So you're basically -- you just look at all the big banks. I mean no one's really doing much. Fundamentally, we haven't changed our outlook at all. Sure, we'll make some adjustments to our WACC rates and everything else and the discount rate to reflect current interest rates, but we're not buying things with debt at the end of the day. I mean, I think that that's just muddling. So we're still -- we've got some opportunities in the pipeline that hopefully we can close on in the medium term. So we're still on the front foot, but the price discovery is difficult. Let me just put it that way.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks so much.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey. Rich, maybe just a higher-level question to start. You guys talked about the capacity expansion. Obviously, the backlog is in good levels today. I'm just curious how you're thinking about that in the context of a potential slowdown in 2023, and ultimately, how you potentially manage to maybe having excess capacity if the demand environment does slow?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Well, look, I mean, where we're expanding capacity is where we believe that we've got secular demand, okay? So, when we're -- what we're doing up in Minneapolis -- I mean, I think I referenced it. If you go back and look at the transcript about the growth rate that we've seen there, I think the same thing with the heat exchangers. So, I've got high confidence about where we're fundamentally expanded capacity of what we're doing it for. But having said that, at the same time, we've begun again after taking a time out due to COVID and this big demand ramp that we've seen over the last 18 months, where we can start actioning footprint again. So, arguably, and I haven't -- I can't tell you on a square foot basis, but I'll bet that we're taking out as much fixed cost footprint in 2023 as we're adding.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. And I guess my follow-on question would be on the pumps and process business. you've been calling out this transition in biopharma pumps now for the last couple of quarters and the fact that you basically just lower up against your toughest comp a year ago. I'm just curious, if we -- do you think we've hit a trough in margins in that business? And maybe you can just talk a little bit more about how much longer you'll continue to see that transition across that piece of your portfolio?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Some of the growth that we missed on margins, we were 29.7% versus 30%. God help me. But anyway, look, we think that the segment itself is a 30% full year margin business. You'll get some volatility quarter-by-quarter. We've seen it, right, because of the fact -- but I think that we were trying to say, if you go back and look at what we were saying Q2, Q3 a year ago of -- let's not get all excited. I think that we posted 35%, 36% margins during that time period that we kept saying that 30% was kind of the new normal for the segment itself. I got to tell you, I'm actually very pleased with the margin performance in Q3 because what you can't see is the mix impact of how much biopharma is down, which is down a lot, right, because we've just got capacity meaningfully to let this inventory liquidate. But the margin performance we're getting out of what were sub-20% industrial businesses that make up the balance of the portfolio, we've actually lifted those businesses up. So, if this has happened to us three years ago, the margin compression that we would have seen would have been meaningful. But the fact of the matter is, is that the operators on the industrial side have improved their margin profile significantly, which has allowed us -- we're going to do 30% for the year. So, overall -- we look at this at this point, what we'll take -- if we take another quarter of pain on the biopharma side, so be it. I look at that as a potential margin enhancement now for 2023 as opposed to a headwind.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hi Scott.\nScott Davis: Most of my questions have been answered. But on the FX side, Rich, is it still mostly just a translation issue? And -- or is it -- or have we gotten so extreme now that there's actually some global trade that's being adjusted?\nRichard Tobin: Look, the vast majority is translation. I'll let Brad step in because if you can imagine with having 18 operating companies, finding out transaction on FX, I don't believe it's meaningful. But he's done\u2026\nBrad Cerepak: No. That's correct. It's mostly translation. And as you know, as we talked about in the script, we said the strength of the dollar was so fast in Q3 here that it really changed the dynamics of what we saw and the impacts on top line and on our EPS. And again, it's about $0.10 forecast to forecast, happens to be about $0.10 at the midpoint of our guide, too. So you could look at it that way. There's lots of ways to look at our guide change. But I would tell you, FX and where we're at now and the strength of the dollar, it's significant. And it's been significant all year, but even more so now. I don't think we're unique, though, Scott. I don't think we're unique in that regard.\nScott Davis: Likely not. So just to back up a little bit, Rich on the M&A side, you made some comments, but it's -- how wide is the lens, I guess, is a question I want to ask. Is that -- are you -- I mean there's assets available, we're told at least, by folks. And there's not a counterbid by some of the traditional folks out there. People are hunkering down a bit. But is the lens wide enough where you take a stab at maybe something that is a little bit a field of your existing portfolio?\nRichard Tobin: No. And I guess the question is how long is a piece of string? I mean, I think -- I'll answer your question in two ways. I think it's got to be a business that we believe that we've got a fundamental right to run. We're a manufacturer at the end of the day. So if it's a manufacturing business and the processes on the factory floor are similar to what we do, meaning that we've got a management team that knows how to extract value out of it, it doesn't necessarily have to be in an end market that we participate today. But we are not making any left or right turns into whatever the new area for industrials to go in and chasing thematics. I mean, we're much more blockers than tacklers. We know what we're good at. And we know that we've built a back-office engine now that allows us to extract meaningful synergy costs out of like-minded businesses over time and that's our knitting. But back to the issue about the scale, we've got the ability now to take on something materially larger than we would have undertaken back in 2018 or 2019.\nScott Davis: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Good luck guys. Appreciate it.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. I wanted to revisit base cost and then the cost side of things. And could you talk about the raws piece versus the components piece and timing of when we start to see some of that come in? I would assume that raws just kind of flows through, but I'm not sure what you're seeing from your suppliers and how much pressure you're putting on them to get cost down in a lower raws environment.\nBrad Cerepak: The raws -- as we talk about raws because we're a purchaser of raw material, you're seeing the benefit now. There was an issue of getting hung up in inventory back in Q2. Now you see the roll-forward in Q3, plus the fact that we priced for it, and we're positive price/cost now on the raw side. On the subcomponents, it's a bit over the map. We don't see on the subcomponents the pricing come down yet because currently, demand exceeds supply. If that was to change, then we would be a lot harder on some of our kind of component suppliers to reflect that in their pricing. So right now, everybody is in a standoff between, well, you want the product, so you're going to pay for the product. We'll see. And we're part of that chain also. So right now, we're getting the benefit of reduced raw material cycling through inventory and the pricing. We're not seeing it on our purchasing of subcomponents yet, but that will be dependent on volume, I guess, as we go forward.\nJoe O'Dea: Got it. And then on Clean Energy & Fueling and the cost out, just the magnitude of the margin benefit to make sure -- sort of think about the cadence and impact properly. I mean it looks like this is something like a 250 basis point margin lift, something we could be seeing as early as Q4. Maybe just talk about cadence and magnitude on that. And then to the degree you're willing to kind of touch on some of the additional cost out, how the magnitude of that compares to what you're currently sharing?\nRichard Tobin: You won't see it in Q4 other than the fact that it's buffering the negative fixed cost absorption by taking the production down. So what you'll see -- you can't see it, but what you see in the segment margin, and you see it in Q3, that if we're out taking some of that cost action, then you would have seen a margin compression in the segment. We expect that to remain for Q4, subject to what we do across the portfolio in terms of production performance. And so you have the rollover benefit in the bridge there. And Joe, we're going to do at a Investor Day because we haven't set longer-term margin targets. And I think let's wait until we get to guidance for 2023 and we do that Investor Day, and I think we'll clarify what the upside is because it's a fundamental change to the business model. It's not just cost takeout.\nJoe O'Dea: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning. Hi.\nDeane Dray: Hey, a couple of clarification questions. I want to go back to Andy's questions. And you've got a decline in bookings. It's modest. But Rich, is there any impact as you improve lead times? We're hearing the customers then don't have to order in advance as much. So -- and also fewer units in their orders. Are you seeing that dynamic playing out?\nRichard Tobin: Not the fewer units because the lot sizes -- on the components business, a lot sizes are what they are and then the buildup units, we get orders of one. No -- but look, Deane, I mean, at the end of the day, it's natural. Why? With the uncertainty that's out there, this hope that pricing is going to come down and everybody recognizing the supply chain is better, no one's going to order transactional products six months in advance, which I think that when our backlog was going up, we were warning everybody. But despite the fact that everybody wants to write book-to-bills down by 0.5%. And it's healthy in a way. So what our customers are saying is, 'We're going to go back to the more traditional order patterns or not.' We have a lot of discussions with our customers about capacity utilization, and it goes back to a discussion as opposed to, you don't give me your orders, you're not getting the product. And that's where we were for the last 18 months.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then just on your European outlook, you're not seeing it in the numbers yet, but are there any contingencies you have in place and maybe even for fuel availability? Just how have you thought that through for the next couple of quarters?\nRichard Tobin: We are a small manufacturer from a footprint point of view in Europe. So we have exposure to fuel as an input cost, but it's -- I mean, we're not a chemical manufacturer. It's just not the same. But we are cautious about the demand for Europe and have been cautious about the demand in Europe all through the quarter. And so, part of this whole discussion about taking down production performance and liquidating working capital, that's -- part of that is a European phenomenon.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And just last one. Could you just clarify on the pump side and biopharma? How is your mix related to non-COVID? You've had a COVID boost. But if there's less COVID production, vaccine production, et cetera, how is your non-COVID exposure?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I'm not going to break it. I think you can send that as a follow-up, and the guys can work with you in clarification. I don't want to go through because, actually, I don't have it at the top of my head. So let me -- let the guys work that up for you, and they'll take you through it.\nDeane Dray: Sure. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Hi. \nNigel Coe: Hello. Thanks for the details, as always. So, Rich, as we -- you kind of -- obviously, you're talking about some cost reduction selectively across the -- in fueling. You're talking about the Fed. And I think we've tempered that your view about demand disruption. But are you taking any other measures, maybe dab on the brakes on hiring? It sounds like CapEx, you're investing in selective. But what about CapEx? Are you thinking about CapEx down in 2023? I mean, any other measures to prepare for a more uncertain macro?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. I think the CapEx is going to be down in 2023, and it would have been under any demand scenario. I think that what we've got in the pipe -- what we've done and what we've got in the pipe -- we haven't done the full budget for next year, but I think that, off the top of my head, it was going to be down regardless. So, I think, it's going to be mostly maintenance capital and in-flight that we've already announced, frankly. I'm not aware of anything hanging out there. Yes, on the hiring, yes, let selectively by region and then selectively by business. I think that, we've been doing that progressively during the quarter, for sure.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then, on the inventory, there was a slight build Q-o-Q. I'm not sure if that was mainly inflation impact. But how much inventory do you think you can get out of the system by year-end? I understand you've talked about 1Q 2023 would be -- how much do you think we can get out by year-end? And maybe just -- Brad, if you can just address the production talent that you're expecting for 4Q?\nRichard Tobin: Okay. I'll take it. I think that, as Brad mentioned in the script, we expect inventory -- we don't have a lot of -- first off, we don't have a ton of finished goods inventory. What we have is WIP and raw materials, right? And that's going to come down. The issue is going to be, depending on the cadence of the revenue, how much is going to get hung up in receivables. So, we've taken production performance down to push hard on inventory because we think that we -- I already discussed why. So, I don't know if Brad is going to monetize it for you. I don't think it's going to be meaningful. But I think you got to be careful about between the size of the inventory drawdown versus the benefit into working capital because of the receivables.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes, I think -- and that's exactly what we said was it's the timing element to it. What I would say is it's taken a long time to build the inventory. It's going to take some time to take it out, but we're proactive on it. I think fourth quarter is going to look a lot like we've done historically. It is our highest quarter. If you look back in time, you'll find six out of the last seven years with high teens, in some cases, over 20%, free cash flow to revs in the fourth quarter. Our goal is the combination of taking out inventory and liquidating some of the receivables to mirror that. We'll see how well we do. Like I said in the prepared comments, it could take into the could take into the could take into the first part of 2023.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe I just wanted to try and circle back on the sort of inventory and cash flow dynamics. So, I just wondered if -- when you look at your customers' inventory levels and maybe the excesses there, do they sort of map and match where you think your excess inventories are as well? And maybe just call out some of the areas when you're looking at the customer or distributor that you sell into, where you think there might be the most sort of pernicious excess inventory. And also when you're thinking about toggling sort of underproduction and the impact on versus your free cash flow, should we assume that next year perhaps we have sub-par cash flow conversion as well just as you try and sort of protect the earnings while bringing down inventory and receivables?\nRichard Tobin: Well, okay, where to start on that? If we take production down, it's to liquidate inventory, right? So, if we go into next year, hopefully, the inventory comes back because that means that demand is robust. So, -- but we're not going to talk about 2023 demand because nobody knows. Our inventory that we can see is in distribution, and we are not aware of excess inventory in the supply chain. What we can see is OEM inventory. And that's kind of what we saw from biopharma turned down, that there was a lot of excess inventory on the OEM side. But we don't make product -- we don't make finished goods product to be called off. So, our finished goods inventory that we have is for an order. The only thing that we have is raw materials. So, I'm not sitting here being overly concerned that we've got excess raw materials that are not going to get consumed over time. It will get consumed depending on the velocity of the demand.\nJulian Mitchell: Understood. Thanks. And my follow-up just around the restructuring and the cost-out. So I think your restructuring expense guide for the year is unchanged at $0.17 now. I think it was $0.16 before, and that's probably just the share count guide coming down. But it seems like you're talking up the cost savings from restructuring next year. So I'm just wondering how you're generating those savings if you're not booking the P&L restructuring or not stepping up the booked P&L restructuring expenses.\nRichard Tobin: No. Julian, I'm not talking about the restructuring expenses. What I'm saying is -- in that chart is benefit. We've given you the EPS benefit of the restructuring within 2022 and the full year benefit of those announced restructurings in 2023. We have got other restructuring projects that we're working on that we will announce in time. The fact of the matter is when we take a restructuring charge, we feel obligated to tell you what the benefit is, and that's on a 12-month benefit going forward next year. It does not include any restructuring that has not been announced.\nJulian Mitchell: I understand. So the savings next year, we could see some of that reflected in -- or the measures for that in restructuring expenses in 2023 itself?\nBrad Cerepak: Yes, sure.\nRichard Tobin: Full year benefit of it, for sure.\nBrad Cerepak: But some of that is also in 2o22, as Richard said. So it straddles both.\nRichard Tobin: It's not double counted, I guess, is what we're saying.\nBrad Cerepak: Yeah, yeah.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s clear. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Welcome.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer period and Dover's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. The top bridge shows our organic revenue growth of 9%, driven by increases in four of our five segments. FX was substantial at 5% or a $97 million headwind to our revenue growth as well as our profitability, resulting in $0.11 of negative EPS impact in the quarter. Changes in foreign currency translation from our last guide in July until today are estimated to have an incremental impact of approximately $0.10 to our full year EPS. M&A contributed $55 million to the top line in the quarter, a product of $89 million from acquisitions, partially offset by $34 million from a divestiture late last year. We saw solid organic growth across our major geographies. The US, our largest market, was up 11% organically in the quarter. Europe was up 9%, and all of Asia was up 13%. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia, posted 8% organic growth this quarter, up from a 4% decline last quarter as our businesses recovered from COVID-driven lockdowns that impacted our ability to produce and sell in the country. On the bottom of the chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to foreign currency translation and improved lead times across several businesses. Our cash flow statement is on Slide 7. Free cash flow through the first three quarters of the year sits at approximately $300 million, down year-over-year on capital expenditures investment, timing of tax payments and performance payments, but mostly on planned investments in working capital. We have been carrying elevated raw materials and components inventory levels throughout the year, reflective of our high backlog levels and input shortages as well as higher receivable balances on growing sales. We are actively working to bring down our inventory through the balance of the year and expect to further liquidate our working capital position with the degree of cash generation also dependent on the timing of collection of receivables. We expect free cash flow generation to significantly improve in the fourth quarter, which is historically our highest cash flow quarter of the year. However, the exact timing of working capital liquidation may take into early 2023. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Hi, Steve. No. That's correct. It's mostly translation. And as you know, as we talked about in the script, we said the strength of the dollar was so fast in Q3 here that it really changed the dynamics of what we saw and the impacts on top line and on our EPS. And again, it's about $0.10 forecast to forecast, happens to be about $0.10 at the midpoint of our guide, too. So you could look at it that way. There's lots of ways to look at our guide change. But I would tell you, FX and where we're at now and the strength of the dollar, it's significant. And it's been significant all year, but even more so now. I don't think we're unique, though, Scott. I don't think we're unique in that regard. The raws -- as we talk about raws because we're a purchaser of raw material, you're seeing the benefit now. There was an issue of getting hung up in inventory back in Q2. Now you see the roll-forward in Q3, plus the fact that we priced for it, and we're positive price/cost now on the raw side. On the subcomponents, it's a bit over the map. We don't see on the subcomponents the pricing come down yet because currently, demand exceeds supply. If that was to change, then we would be a lot harder on some of our kind of component suppliers to reflect that in their pricing. So right now, everybody is in a standoff between, well, you want the product, so you're going to pay for the product. We'll see. And we're part of that chain also. So right now, we're getting the benefit of reduced raw material cycling through inventory and the pricing. We're not seeing it on our purchasing of subcomponents yet, but that will be dependent on volume, I guess, as we go forward. Yes, I think -- and that's exactly what we said was it's the timing element to it. What I would say is it's taken a long time to build the inventory. It's going to take some time to take it out, but we're proactive on it. I think fourth quarter is going to look a lot like we've done historically. It is our highest quarter. If you look back in time, you'll find six out of the last seven years with high teens, in some cases, over 20%, free cash flow to revs in the fourth quarter. Our goal is the combination of taking out inventory and liquidating some of the receivables to mirror that. We'll see how well we do. Like I said in the prepared comments, it could take into the could take into the could take into the first part of 2023. Yes, sure. But some of that is also in 2o22, as Richard said. So it straddles both. Yeah, yeah."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the performance highlights on slide three. Dover delivered revenue growth and margin improvement in the third quarter, driven by rigorous execution and improving price/cost dynamics that were offset -- that more than offset the impact of supply chain challenges, inflationary cost pressures and foreign currency translation. Demand remains constructive across most of the portfolio with four out of five segments posting organic growth in the quarter. Backlog at $3.2 billion was up 12% year-over-year and remains approximately double the historical levels relative to revenue, driven by continued strong demand across many end markets. The supply chain challenges that we've endured over the past 18 months continued to improve, which has allowed us to reduce our backlog this quarter through increased production performance. It is our expectation that this trend will continue for the balance of the year as supply chains and lead times normalize. Despite the building macroeconomic uncertainty, we are deploying capital to drive productivity and expand capacity in several businesses that are expected to deliver robust growth on secular tailwinds. We closed on the Malema Engineering acquisition in July, which adds a great technology to our biopharma portfolio, and we are continuing to pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions. During the quarter, we also announced an accelerated share repurchase program to return $500 million of excess capital to shareholders, while preserving sufficient liquidity for value-creating investments. While current demand conditions are solid, our management posture reflects growing caution with the macroeconomic outlook. As such, for the balance of the year, we'll be proactively reducing output in several businesses to draw down inventory balances and initiating cost-containment measures where appropriate. Our business model is flexible, as our 2020 performance has proven. We firmly believe that ongoing improvements in the supply chain and available production capacity will allow us to match production to meet demand within prevailing lead times in Q1 of 2023. We are adjusting our full year guidance to reflect the negative translation impact of foreign exchange on our revenue and earnings. The estimated full year impact of foreign exchange to EPS is approximately $0.37 per share with notable acceleration during the third quarter as the dollar rallied against most of our trading currencies. Let's skip slide 4 and move on to slide 5. All-in-all, the quarter developed as we expected. The capital goods portions of the portfolio delivered strong top line and margin expansion on the back of strong order books, lower input costs cycling through inventory, as well as pricing actions taking hold. Engineered Products revenue was up 18% organically in the quarter on broad-based strength across the portfolio in major geographies as well as pricing actions. Margins were up 250 basis points year-over-year as our capital investments and productivity begin to show results and our investments in e-commerce platforms drive aftermarket volume. We expect margins to continue their upward trajectory through the balance of the year on solid volumes and improving price/cost dynamics. Clean Energy & Fueling was roughly flat on an organic basis. Revenue performance was up in clean energy components, vehicle wash, fuel transport and below-ground retail fueling, but was offset by lower shipments and order trends in above ground retail fueling, driven by customer construction delays in North America, as well as overall caution among operators in Europe and Asia as a result of the weakening macro environment. Margins in the quarter were flat year-over-year as our clean energy margin mix and decisive cost actions were able to offset the reduced volumes and fixed cost absorption in the above ground dispenser business. During this quarter, we began to take fixed cost reduction actions in our dispenser business that were in part enabled by the global product platform harmonization and complexity reduction work that we've completed in the past 12 months, which enabled us to reduce our European dispenser SKUs offering by over 50%. These actions will continue through the first half of 2023 and will result in meaningfully improved operating margins going forward. In Imaging & Identification, volumes for our marking and coding printers and spare parts recovered well on improving electronics input availability as well as the roll-off of COVID lockdowns in China from the prior quarter. Pricing actions and consumables and service demand were positive contributors in the quarter. FX is a negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in this segment given its large base of non-US dollar revenue. Q3 margins in Imaging & ID were very strong, improving 230 basis points, driven by pricing actions, product mix richness and improved operational efficiency. Pumps & Process Solutions posted 2% organic growth. We saw solid performance in industrial pumps, medical and thermal connectors, polymer processing and recycling and precision components. As expected, the biopharma components business, which delivered peak revenue in Q3 last year on COVID vaccine demand, declined year-over-year in the quarter as the biopharma industry continues to pivot from COVID vaccines to a growing suite of biologic therapies. Our non-biomedical and thermal connector business has grown 30% year-to-date, driven largely by demand in data center and electrical vehicle charger cooling applications. On the back of this demand and forecasted demand, we are finalizing the commissioning of a new assembly plant in the Minneapolis area in Q4. Operating margin in the quarter remained robust at approximately 30% despite a larger proportion of revenues from industrial products and from improved volumes, pricing and efficiency programs across the segment. Top line in Climate & Sustainable Technologies continued to be strong, posting 19% organic growth on solid volume and pricing actions across all businesses and geographies. All three businesses have significant backlogs into 2023. Our capacity expansion programs and CO2 systems and heat exchangers remain on schedule as we continue to invest behind areas of secular growth beyond 2022. Margins were up 500 basis points in the quarter on price and strong volumes, materially improved productivity in food retail as a result of capital deployment projects and product complexity reduction and improved portfolio mix in can-making equipment and spares and heat exchangers. I'll pass it to Brad here. Okay. Thanks, Brad. Let's move to Slide 8. Let's discuss the battleground items for the balance of 2022 with a brand-new slide, demand trends and backlog. More than a year ago, we were clear that we expected comparable booking metrics to moderate when supply chains start normalizing, and that's the story of the quarter. Bookings were down on a year-to-year basis against a very high comparable quarter, and backlog declined this quarter as a result of improved production performance, which drove the top line. I call your attention to the middle column of the slide. Our backlog remains at historically high levels, about double where it was relative to sales prior to the pandemic. This is driven to a lesser extent now by extended lead times and customer placing post-pandemic orders much further in advance than normal as a result of supply chain and industrial capacity constraints, but more importantly, by strength of fundamental demand of our products and solutions in multiple markets that are indicated with green arrows on the slide. We've talked about secular growth drivers in some of these markets previously, and we continue to see robust near-term trends driving investment in these businesses. Despite strong demand, shipments were held back in the quarter in several businesses, most notably in Engineered Products, due to hydraulic component shortages and chassis availability and in Climate & Sustainability due to subcomponents availability and capacity constraints. We are currently expanding capacity in both CO2 systems in the United States and heat exchangers in four different geographies to meet projected demand. The portions highlighted in orange, we expected to some degree, but above ground fueling weakened in the third quarter as our customers have not been able to overcome short-term construction delays, pushing new builds into 2023. And the biopharma transition from the COVID vaccine production has taken longer than we would expect. We expect both to normalize as we move into 2023 based on inventory drawdowns and reconfirmed CapEx plans. All-in-all, our backlog remains elevated, and we will continue to support the top line. Additionally, our backlogs give us confidence and visibility to plan our production efficiently, and as I mentioned earlier, will allow us to manage our working capital by flexing production performance to quarterly demand. Today, about 70% of our Q4 revenue is already booked, and we have a solid foundation of book business carrying to 2023 that you can see on the slide by segment, highlighting the healthy mix of short and long-cycle elements of the portfolio. Let's go to the bridge on slide 9. Here shows sources of value creation that lead to our forecast double-digit EPS growth this year. We expect to significantly offset much of the $0.37 of FX headwind this year through strong execution and cost controls. We are conducting short-term cost containment measures where appropriate, but more importantly, we are beginning some fundamental cost actions in our Clean Energy & Fueling segment. The 2023 full year EPS accretion from these actions is expected to -- expected at approximately $0.23 per share. We have additional cost actions underway, which we'll update on the Q4 call. Between our current in-flight restructuring activities and the share repurchases completed this year, we expect a solid foundation of EPS carryover benefit into 2023. As we prepare for various macroeconomic scenarios next year, we are confident in our portfolio's ability to outgrow and out-execute in our respective markets. The niche markets that we participate in are attractive and structurally sound from a competitive point of view. Our investments in back-office consolidation, e-commerce platforms and product line complexity reductions are providing us a multiyear runway to further reduce our fixed cost structure and variable costs while enriching the customer experience. Through organic and inorganic growth, we have rescaled Dover since the spin in 2018, which provides us increased optionality for the portfolio decisions as we continue our value creation journey. In closing, I'd like to recognize that we've been pushing our group hard this year, and I want to thank my colleagues around the globe for their continued dedication and strong performance in a demanding operating environment. And with that, Jack, we'll go to Q&A. Good morning. Well, I mean, I think we're taking a guess at FX for the balance of the year, and we've been wrong all year. So there's some caution related to that. Look, at the end of the day, we're going to build what we have in our backlog. I think that we are making an adjustment to our posture somewhat in terms of production performance. Look, we've been -- you can see in our working capital balances that we've been running excess inventory all year, because we've been kind of chasing this demand curve. We've been -- we've seen notable differences and improvements on the supply chain across most of the portfolio with some few exceptions during the quarter, which allows us to change our posture of, you know what, let's turn down the production performance machine in Q4 somewhat. Let's liquidate working capital because, you know what, I'm confident that we can restart it in Q1 and push that production performance into next year. So we get the benefit of the reduced working capital this year, and we get the benefit of the production performance in 2023. I think it's the prudent thing to do. I'm not going to make any comments on what we think about 2023 demand yet. We'll wait for next quarter to do that. But clearly, we have some caution in terms of what's going to develop in the marketplace. I fundamentally disagree with what the Fed is doing now. They say that they're data-driven. But if you look at our results themselves, logistics costs, raw material costs have all come down. So the inflation that we had seen over the past 18 months is coming down. But if they are going to continue -- and they believe that they're data-driven. Well, I don't think that we've seen now the impact. We see it in housing now, the impact of increase in rates. So if they're looking for demand destruction, then we have absolutely no other posture than to accommodate that by lowering our inventory balances and moving that production into next year. So I think it's a good news, bad news story. I think we get the working capital and the cash flow this year, which under the trajectory we're on right now, we would have been pushing that working capital liquidation almost exclusively into 2023. We can pull some of that into 2022. That's correct. Say any way you want, but that's right. Yeah. Price/cost, you can see it. We had been saying all year that in the capital goods portion of the portfolio, because of the inventory balances roll forward and because of the exposure on raw materials, that we expect the back half -- and take a look at the performance on both Engineered Products and the refrigeration unit, I mean, those are largely as a result of the dynamics that we discussed on previous calls. We don't see any pushback right now in terms of pricing, but I think that that's going to be reflective of demand we go through. And more importantly, that pricing wasn't there in the first half of this year. So if everything holds firm, we get a pretty good credit from a comp perspective going into the first half of 2023. I expect to have positive price/cost in the first half of next year, assuming that demand is reasonable. Thanks. Hi, Andy. No. The only place that we've seen it are the areas that we called out specifically in the slide. Other than that, we were not seeing those robust crazy numbers that we were seeing a year-ago this time. But I mean, I think quarter-to-quarter, across the portfolio, while we're less than one, I mean we're at 0.96, it's not like we've seen a dramatic slowdown. But what we're hearing from our customers is two things. Those customers that we're providing products into CapEx are -- by and large, every CapEx project this year that our customers have undertaken have taken too long and have cost too much because of labor availability and total inflation. And so what you see now is as everybody gets more cautious about demand in 2023 that there's almost this view of, you know what, we're going to push some of this demand into 2023. We're going to finish what we got inflight, and then we're going to see where we are. That's the signal we're getting, particularly in the above-ground fueling side. On the biopharma side, I'd just call your attention to every -- all of our customers' results and will tell you that we started reducing product into the channel much earlier. And we provide a consumable product. So I wouldn't take a look at some of the systems manufacturers and say, 'Well, that's a direct proxy.' I think that we are a little bit ahead of the curve in terms of that demand. And as long as those units run, eventually, over time, they're going to consume our products. So we think that this is a margin tailwind moving into 2023. But overall, Andy, at the end of the day, you can't -- as I said to Steve a moment ago, I disagree of what the Fed is doing at this point. There's enough in the system right now that they're going to get what they want. But if they overcorrect, they're going to get demand destruction. So -- and all of our customers are now on pins and needles about that right now. So we can only do one thing, and that is to prepare for a scenario as such. And because we have a flexible operating model, I think that we just get on the front foot and do in Q4 and if we have to catch up in Q1, so be it. Well, I mean, I think that we finally got to where we said we were going to get to. It only took five years, but I think that that's -- I guess we can hang our hat on it... Well, I mean, I think we would have made it if not for the whole COVID disaster. But nonetheless, look, Belvac -- when you look at that backlog chart, a big chunk of that is Belvac, right? So it's sold well through 2023. At some point, that business is going to have to pivot to more replacement parts, but we look at it as the installed base has increased exponentially. And the margin profile of spares versus built-out units is actually accretive to margins. Goal for refrigeration, demand is still there. We'll have a little bit of a slowdown in deliveries in Q4 just because we went into the Christmas season when everybody stops doing construction projects. But our backlog there remains robust. CO2, we think we've got secular demand behind it. That's why we're expanding capacity. And the heat exchangers, look, I mean, we're expanding capacity in every geographical region. I think we talked about it before. We've been the beneficiary of a significant amount of step-up in volume for a product that goes into heat pumps. And if you look at the major manufacturers, they're all announcing capacity expansions worldwide just because of the technology change. So we feel good about it. Thanks. Yeah. It's been a couple of years since we got the portfolio questions. I was missing them, Jeff. So I decided to put recommendation to restart it. Look, I mean, I think that when we used to get questions about the portfolio, part of the answer that we gave was that you can't descale to the amount that we did back in 2018 and then begin talking about portfolio because you run into a scale problem after a while. So if you remember, we spun off Apergy and we had to take some significant cost restructuring to accommodate the fact firm-wide that absorption was going to be an issue. And when we got asked questions again about bigger portfolio moves, part of the answer was, hey, look, there's a lot of value that we can create out of the existing portfolio, which we have, but also to the extent that we can rescale the portfolio, then that opens up an avenue where we don't have to worry so much about that. So that's where we are. If you take a look at where we were in terms of total revenue, pre-Apergy spin and where we're going to close now, where we've rebuilt that scale and that makes a variety of scenarios more possible on top of the fact that the portfolio in totality is worth a lot more than it was back in 2018. Sure. The Clean Energy & Fueling one is a bit unique. I mean, we did -- we were a little bit surprised in Q3 when the demand went down, because all the signals that we were getting from our customers were -- that there was plenty of projects through the balance of the year. So it basically forced us taking actions that we were planning on doing in January and pulling them into Q3. I mean, we've been preparing for a scenario around the retail fueling business to adapt its position kind of in a post-EMV world, for years now, right? I mean, we spent a significant amount of money in revitalizing the portfolio. At the same time, we spent a significant amount of management time reducing the SKUs, which allows us in the future to make some broader decisions on footprint and a variety of other things. So to a certain extent, part of what we did was in reaction to the demand environment, but it was coming nonetheless. I just think that we had to pull it forward by about three or four months. On the balance of the portfolio, I could only go back to March 2020. I don't see that scenario. But I think that we've proven that if we have significant demand destruction that there are a variety of levers that we can pull, which I don't want to pull. But I think that we -- if you take a look at our performance in 2020 in terms of margin preservation, I think that we did quite well. Well, I mean, look, if our backlog is double than historic, then it's 50% more. But I mean -- but it's all over the map, depending on whether it's short cycle or long cycle. If you look at that chart, right, printing and ID has got higher backlog, but it's actually quite low relative to its revenue, because that's a consumable business. We don't generally carry any backlog there. So you're going to see a bifurcation between capital goods with longer lead times and bigger build schedules between shorter lead times. They're all up in aggregate, but there's different dynamics between the five of them. Yes. Hi, Andrew. Well, that's quite the tour de force. Look, there's nothing wrong with having backlog. Given the choice between having it and not having it, I'd rather have it at the end of the day. There are complexities with the issue of backlog, because you're managing pricing of the backlog. And if you recall, we suffered at the beginning of this year where we had a large backlog coming out of 2021 and then ran into cost inflation. And then we had this grand debate whether you could reprice your backlog, which is really a competitive stack issue whether you thought you could get away with it or not and everybody kind of did their thing. I think that backlogs because of kind of the supply chain risk of shortening the supply chain, which I think we've been the beneficiary of, I think that's going to have a little bit of an impact there. So -- but again, I think it's very difficult to compare company to company unless they're pure players because certain businesses are always going to have elevated backlogs in the portfolio. I mentioned Belvac, but Maag would be the same way within our portfolio, where the build time of these products is 90, 120 days. So you've got to get basically the orders -- before you even buy the subcomponents in the raw materials, you need to have the order in place as opposed to marketing Maags, where we don't get all worked up about backlog because it's just consumer volume and being able to price it correctly and make the deliveries on time. So there's a lot to unpack there, Andrew. I mean, I think because of the breadth of our portfolio, we touch it all, all the scenarios. I think that the actions that we're taking now is a little bit of caution of -- you can't look at backlog trends and then project that into 2023, right? I think that we're basically saying supply chain is caught up now. The backlog that we have that we need to deliver in the back half of Q1, we can make it in Q1 so let's not make it in Q4. That's really the pivot that we're making right now. Yes. Well, as you would know better than most, price discovery right now is difficult, right? Because what revenue and what demand is going to be in 2023 is anybody's option. And then you've got this whole issue of, boy, I could have sold this thing 18 months ago and got this crazy multiple, and now I can't have it anymore. So you're basically -- you just look at all the big banks. I mean no one's really doing much. Fundamentally, we haven't changed our outlook at all. Sure, we'll make some adjustments to our WACC rates and everything else and the discount rate to reflect current interest rates, but we're not buying things with debt at the end of the day. I mean, I think that that's just muddling. So we're still -- we've got some opportunities in the pipeline that hopefully we can close on in the medium term. So we're still on the front foot, but the price discovery is difficult. Let me just put it that way. Thanks. Joe. Yes. Well, look, I mean, where we're expanding capacity is where we believe that we've got secular demand, okay? So, when we're -- what we're doing up in Minneapolis -- I mean, I think I referenced it. If you go back and look at the transcript about the growth rate that we've seen there, I think the same thing with the heat exchangers. So, I've got high confidence about where we're fundamentally expanded capacity of what we're doing it for. But having said that, at the same time, we've begun again after taking a time out due to COVID and this big demand ramp that we've seen over the last 18 months, where we can start actioning footprint again. So, arguably, and I haven't -- I can't tell you on a square foot basis, but I'll bet that we're taking out as much fixed cost footprint in 2023 as we're adding. Yes. Some of the growth that we missed on margins, we were 29.7% versus 30%. God help me. But anyway, look, we think that the segment itself is a 30% full year margin business. You'll get some volatility quarter-by-quarter. We've seen it, right, because of the fact -- but I think that we were trying to say, if you go back and look at what we were saying Q2, Q3 a year ago of -- let's not get all excited. I think that we posted 35%, 36% margins during that time period that we kept saying that 30% was kind of the new normal for the segment itself. I got to tell you, I'm actually very pleased with the margin performance in Q3 because what you can't see is the mix impact of how much biopharma is down, which is down a lot, right, because we've just got capacity meaningfully to let this inventory liquidate. But the margin performance we're getting out of what were sub-20% industrial businesses that make up the balance of the portfolio, we've actually lifted those businesses up. So, if this has happened to us three years ago, the margin compression that we would have seen would have been meaningful. But the fact of the matter is, is that the operators on the industrial side have improved their margin profile significantly, which has allowed us -- we're going to do 30% for the year. So, overall -- we look at this at this point, what we'll take -- if we take another quarter of pain on the biopharma side, so be it. I look at that as a potential margin enhancement now for 2023 as opposed to a headwind. Thanks. Hi Scott. Look, the vast majority is translation. I'll let Brad step in because if you can imagine with having 18 operating companies, finding out transaction on FX, I don't believe it's meaningful. But he's done... No. And I guess the question is how long is a piece of string? I mean, I think -- I'll answer your question in two ways. I think it's got to be a business that we believe that we've got a fundamental right to run. We're a manufacturer at the end of the day. So if it's a manufacturing business and the processes on the factory floor are similar to what we do, meaning that we've got a management team that knows how to extract value out of it, it doesn't necessarily have to be in an end market that we participate today. But we are not making any left or right turns into whatever the new area for industrials to go in and chasing thematics. I mean, we're much more blockers than tacklers. We know what we're good at. And we know that we've built a back-office engine now that allows us to extract meaningful synergy costs out of like-minded businesses over time and that's our knitting. But back to the issue about the scale, we've got the ability now to take on something materially larger than we would have undertaken back in 2018 or 2019. Thanks. You won't see it in Q4 other than the fact that it's buffering the negative fixed cost absorption by taking the production down. So what you'll see -- you can't see it, but what you see in the segment margin, and you see it in Q3, that if we're out taking some of that cost action, then you would have seen a margin compression in the segment. We expect that to remain for Q4, subject to what we do across the portfolio in terms of production performance. And so you have the rollover benefit in the bridge there. And Joe, we're going to do at a Investor Day because we haven't set longer-term margin targets. And I think let's wait until we get to guidance for 2023 and we do that Investor Day, and I think we'll clarify what the upside is because it's a fundamental change to the business model. It's not just cost takeout. Good morning. Hi. Not the fewer units because the lot sizes -- on the components business, a lot sizes are what they are and then the buildup units, we get orders of one. No -- but look, Deane, I mean, at the end of the day, it's natural. Why? With the uncertainty that's out there, this hope that pricing is going to come down and everybody recognizing the supply chain is better, no one's going to order transactional products six months in advance, which I think that when our backlog was going up, we were warning everybody. But despite the fact that everybody wants to write book-to-bills down by 0.5%. And it's healthy in a way. So what our customers are saying is, 'We're going to go back to the more traditional order patterns or not.' We have a lot of discussions with our customers about capacity utilization, and it goes back to a discussion as opposed to, you don't give me your orders, you're not getting the product. And that's where we were for the last 18 months. We are a small manufacturer from a footprint point of view in Europe. So we have exposure to fuel as an input cost, but it's -- I mean, we're not a chemical manufacturer. It's just not the same. But we are cautious about the demand for Europe and have been cautious about the demand in Europe all through the quarter. And so, part of this whole discussion about taking down production performance and liquidating working capital, that's -- part of that is a European phenomenon. Yes. I'm not going to break it. I think you can send that as a follow-up, and the guys can work with you in clarification. I don't want to go through because, actually, I don't have it at the top of my head. So let me -- let the guys work that up for you, and they'll take you through it. You're welcome. Hi. Sure. I think the CapEx is going to be down in 2023, and it would have been under any demand scenario. I think that what we've got in the pipe -- what we've done and what we've got in the pipe -- we haven't done the full budget for next year, but I think that, off the top of my head, it was going to be down regardless. So, I think, it's going to be mostly maintenance capital and in-flight that we've already announced, frankly. I'm not aware of anything hanging out there. Yes, on the hiring, yes, let selectively by region and then selectively by business. I think that, we've been doing that progressively during the quarter, for sure. Okay. I'll take it. I think that, as Brad mentioned in the script, we expect inventory -- we don't have a lot of -- first off, we don't have a ton of finished goods inventory. What we have is WIP and raw materials, right? And that's going to come down. The issue is going to be, depending on the cadence of the revenue, how much is going to get hung up in receivables. So, we've taken production performance down to push hard on inventory because we think that we -- I already discussed why. So, I don't know if Brad is going to monetize it for you. I don't think it's going to be meaningful. But I think you got to be careful about between the size of the inventory drawdown versus the benefit into working capital because of the receivables. Well, okay, where to start on that? If we take production down, it's to liquidate inventory, right? So, if we go into next year, hopefully, the inventory comes back because that means that demand is robust. So, -- but we're not going to talk about 2023 demand because nobody knows. Our inventory that we can see is in distribution, and we are not aware of excess inventory in the supply chain. What we can see is OEM inventory. And that's kind of what we saw from biopharma turned down, that there was a lot of excess inventory on the OEM side. But we don't make product -- we don't make finished goods product to be called off. So, our finished goods inventory that we have is for an order. The only thing that we have is raw materials. So, I'm not sitting here being overly concerned that we've got excess raw materials that are not going to get consumed over time. It will get consumed depending on the velocity of the demand. No. Julian, I'm not talking about the restructuring expenses. What I'm saying is -- in that chart is benefit. We've given you the EPS benefit of the restructuring within 2022 and the full year benefit of those announced restructurings in 2023. We have got other restructuring projects that we're working on that we will announce in time. The fact of the matter is when we take a restructuring charge, we feel obligated to tell you what the benefit is, and that's on a 12-month benefit going forward next year. It does not include any restructuring that has not been announced. Full year benefit of it, for sure. It's not double counted, I guess, is what we're saying. Welcome."

Speaking today are Rich Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation in prior consent the recording of this call. If you do not read these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir.\nJack Dickens: Thank you, Emma. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through August 11. The replay link of the webcast will be archived for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everybody. Let's start with the performance highlights on Slide three. Our team delivered a strong second quarter performance, which related to record quarterly revenue and sequential year-over-year earnings growth. Consolidated organic revenue growth of 7% in the quarter as our businesses continue to capitalize on strong backlogs and pricing actions continue to take hold. We believe our ability to execute and provide needed capacity in today's challenging environment has led to noteworthy share gains in multiple markets, which is positive for our continued growth. Components shortages and COVID lock downs and China did negatively impact shipping volumes and consequently efficiency and fixed cost absorption and several businesses during the period, despite these difficulties, as well as FX headwinds are absolute segment profit increased year-over-year, and operating margin improved sequentially in the quarter driven by cost controls good volume and meaningfully improving price cost dynamics. Our strong balance sheet provides flexibility for value creating capital allocation initiatives. We're investing in capacity expansions and productivity improvements across many of our operating companies to capitalize on secular revenue growth opportunities, capture market share and drive improvements in operational performance. The recently-announced Malema acquisition will enhance our biopharma business closed on July 1, and we continue our pursuit of attractive bolt on acquisitions. We also repurchased $85 million worth of shares in the second quarter will continue to proactively evaluate capital deployment alternatives through the remainder of the year. Our strong backlog and constructive demand outlook and execution playbook position as well to deliver growth in revenue and earnings amidst an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. We are maintaining our 2022 adjusted full year guidance of $8.45 to $8.65 per share. I'll skip slide four which shows the detailed quarterly results. Let's move on to Slide five to discuss segment performance. Engineered products revenue was up 19% organically in the quarter on broad base strength across the portfolio in major geographies as well as pricing actions. Margins were up 130 basis points sequentially, and we expect the trend to continue through the second half as price cost spread continues to roll forward. Clean Energy and Fueling volumes are driven by strength in Clean Energy components vehicle wash, and below-ground fueling components offset by the expected roll off of EMV related demand in North America, which peaked in the comparable quarter last year. Margins in the quarter were down year-over-year on lower volumes and constrained inputs and to a certain extent mix. The sequential margin improvement was significant, however, at 410 basis points versus last quarter driven by improving cost dynamics and product mix. In Imaging & ID volumes and our core marketing and coding business were constrained by electronics and other input shortages as well as COVID lock downs in China is offset growth in our serialization of brand management software businesses. FX is a material negative headwind to absolute revenue profits in the segment, given its large base of international revenue. Q2 margins and Imaging & ID were impacted by lower volumes and production stoppages in Asia, but improved sequentially. The team has done a good job in cost containment and finding alternative suppliers to alleviate supply chain constraints and we are confident about good margin conversion in the second half. Pumps and Process Solutions posted a 7% organic growth -- strong double digit growth in our core non-COVID biopharma business, as well as robust growth in medical and thermal connectors, industrial pumps polymer processing and precision components.  Operating margin in the quarter remains robust at 31% plus despite a mix shift towards industrial components. Top line and alignment and sustainability technologies continue to be strong, posting 11% organic growth on solid volume in heat exchangers and beverage can making as well as pricing across all businesses. Volumes and food retail were constrained by supply chain challenges which negatively impact cost efficiency and will result in shipments pushing out into Q4. Comparable and sequential margins were up in the quarter on better mix and price costs, though partially offset by production, efficiencies, and input shortages. As you can see we're marching towards our mid-teens operating margin target in this segment. I'll pass it on to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide six. The top bridge shows our organic revenue growth of 7% driven by increases in three of our five segments. FX was substantial at 4% or $74 million headwind to our revenue growth and is and also to our profitability, resulting in $0.08 negative EPS in the quarter. We expect FX to remain a headwind for the year compared to our prior expectations. In all changes in foreign currency translations from April until today are estimated to have a full year 2022 impact of an incremental $0.10. M&A contributed $49 million to the top line in the quarter a product of $84 million from acquisitions partially offset by $34 million from unified brands divestiture. We saw organic growth across the U.S. and Europe, Asia was flat organically in the quarter as China was down 4% driven principally by COVID lockdowns, offset by growth in other parts of the region. Our businesses in China have resumed operations and we are currently seeing recovery in production and regionally sourced components. On the bottom of the chart, bookings were down year-over-year primarily due to foreign exchange, and a one-off $74 million debooking in beverage can making due to customer financing limitations. Likewise, our backlog was negatively impacted by the aforementioned debooking, as well as a negative impact from FX. Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide seven. Before I get into the charts, I want to remind everyone we now exclude the impact of acquisition amortization accounting from our segment earnings, which avoids a deal related noise quarter-to-quarter and better aligns the basis of our segment earnings presentation with our consolidated adjusted EPS. This change had no impact to our GAAP earnings or adjusted EPS. Now to the charts. Segment earnings were up $9 million in the quarter, on improved volumes and price costs, though partially offset by supply chain constraints and foreign exchange headwinds. Segment margins were down 80 basis points. Adjusted net earnings improved by $10 million driven by higher segment earnings and favorable corporate expenses partially offset by higher taxes. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.5% for the quarter comparable to the prior year period. Discrete tax benefits were lower than the prior year at $4 million in the quarter or approximately $0.03 of EPS. This compares to discrete tax benefits of $0.08 in the second quarter of 2021. We expect our back half tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Our cash flow statement is on slide eight. Free cash flow declined in the first half of the year driven by working capital investments in inventory necessitated by the high backlog. Supply chain constraints exacerbated by input shortages preventing completion of some work in process inventory in the quarter, as well as higher receivable balances on growing sales. The quarter also included $43 million tax payment related to the sale of Unified Brands. Capital expenditures were up year-over-year and are principally in support of our robust growth expectations across several businesses. Free cash flow was 6% of revenue in the quarter and would have been 8% excluding the UB tax payment. We expect cash conversion to improve in the second half of the year more in line with typical cash conversion seasonality in our businesses, driven by earnings, conversion and inventory reductions. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Right. Thanks Brad. Let's go to Slide nine. This slide is our current view of the demand outlook operational environment and margin drivers for the remainder of 2022 by segments. We expect top line and engineer products to remain robust based on elevated backlogs and implemented price increases. Vehicle services continues to see a constructive demand environment across all geographies with particular strength in North America. Demand for refuse collection vehicles and parts remains very strong, and our connected collections digital businesses significantly outperforming expectations. Our backlog includes fully implemented price actions that support the projected recovery and margins we expect volume productivity and improved price cost spread to be positive drivers of earnings accretion and margin improvement in the second half of the year. Clean Energy and fueling, we expect to see robust growth in the second half of the year after a roughly flat first half. We continue to see solid demand in North America for below-ground retail fueling, fuel transport vehicle wash and software solutions. Our acquisitions and clean energy components continue to outperform their year 1 acquisition models, and we have already begun to deploy capital in these businesses to expand capacity and improve productivity. We expect margin performance to improve in the second half on stronger volumes and mix, which will drive improved full year margins in this segment. We expect volumes in Imaging & ID to improve as component shortages is with China recovering from second quarter COVID shutdowns. We continue to work to identify alternative electronics providers to alleviate component bottlenecks going forward and we're beginning to see some inquiries and approve order rates for large scale printers and digital textile printing at positive development and industry that has experienced a prolonged recovery. We expect margin to improve in the second half and better volume and cost containment while keeping a close eye on FX. In Pumps & Process Solutions activity industrial pumps remain, solid polymer processing has booked several big projects to lay the foundation for a very strong second half. And we recently received our single largest order ever for the business in early July. Precision Components continues its upward trajectory in both bearings and compressor components across all geographies as investments in energy sector pickup. We expect the current below normal demand trend and biopharma to continue for the balance of the year as biopharma manufacturers finished transitioning their R&D pipelines and production systems from COVID related businesses to other growing biologic therapies. We expect Climate & Sustainability Technologies to post double-digit organic growth this year driven by its large backlog and pricing initiatives. Demand remains robust across all lines in food retail, while input shortages have hampered food retail shipments they are expected to improve, resulting in a catch up of deferred shipments into the second half of the year. Our heat exchanger businesses positioned well in strong order rates across all geographies and end markets, in particular, in the European heat pump business. In Belvac beverage packing equipment business continues to work through its record backlog. We have already been awarded new projects in Q3 to materially offset the deep working in Q2. We expect margins to improve year-over-year on volume leverage and positive price cost dynamics and normalizing supply chains. Let's go to Slide 10. I presented this slide at a recent conference, but it bears repeating, as not everyone attended the event and the topic continues to be actively debated. There is a view that booking rates of the sole predictor of demand and revenue growth and negative year-over-year bookings on top of a record 2021 are somehow spelling trouble. None of us know what the future holds, especially in the current environment, let's level set on the basics here. First, if you look at our revenue and bookings, they've historically been correlated. But because of demand wave coming out of the pandemic, coupled with extended lead times from supply chain issues and some change in product mix, our bookings jumped in 2021 to $9.4 billion, well ahead of our revenue last year and our guide for 2022 revenue. That resulted in backlogs that are at record highs, roughly double where they have normally been on a 12 months revenue basis. That, over time, should come down, which is healthy because it means we lead times are coming out and global supply chains are improving. Our backlog is sufficient to feed revenue growth for a significant period. And it's worth noting that our backlogs midway through the year are still higher than they were at the beginning of the year. And despite a decline in bookings our book-to-bill ratio so far this year is still above one and in line with historical trends. Our current booking and backlog trends should position us to enter 2023 on solid footing. Let's move to slide 11. And we show historical first half versus the second half margin performance. Historically, Dover has generated higher margins in the second half of the year. Last year was an anomaly as input inflation and supply chain constraints and COVID shutdowns hit the second half. Our sequential margin trajectory is upward and progressing largely as expected, and we remain confident that about the positive second half margin dynamics in line with historical seasonality, although I would note that Q4 will contribute more to absolute profits than normal on backlog and order timing and as we liquidate a large work in progress balances in inventory. Make no mistake; we remain concerned with the inflation trajectory and general macro backdrop and the different demand scenarios that are possible in 2023. We have a playbook to act decisively to adapt both from a cost structure and working capital perspective of the different demand conditions. But sitting here today, looking at our backlog, significant portions of our portfolio were sold out for 2022. So we would expect the order rates to inflect positively as we go into the second half. We have levers that are not demand dependent. We have positive contributions from our organic capital deployment and productivity initiatives in our four enterprise pillar efforts will positively contribute to next year's earnings. We also have very interesting and underappreciated portions of our portfolio where secular demand growth will outperform the broader industrial market. In closing, I'd like to thank my colleagues around the globe for their continued dedication to strong performance in a demanding operating environment. And Jack, I'll hand it back to you, and we can get to the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys good morning. Just you mentioned FX impact in the quarter $0.08, what was it versus expectations? And what is the new guide assume for FX impact on EPS basis versus the previous guide?\nBrad Cerepak: Well, okay, I'll take that. Within the quarter, the impact was about $0.02 of our -- against our expectations. I said for the full year, from here forward, it would be about $0.10. And I think you're asking me specifically what kind of forecast rate are we using. I could say we're using a euro of about $1.05. Today, it's trading at about $1.02. So maybe the headwind is a little bit higher. But we'll see. We'll see what happens now going forward, especially with the ECB raising rates.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just another question on commodities. Commodity is broadly down from their peak. So how should we think about -- you definitely highlighted that supply chain is getting better into the second half. But how should we think about that flowing into Dover cogs? Is it a 6-month lag? Is it a 12-month lag?\nRichard Tobin: On the commodity side, we get the majority of it in the second half, right? So all of that has been in inventory for some period of time of what we've been waiting for is the pricing to roll forward. So we've seen a significant improvement in Q2. And the expectation is on the backlog. The raw materials being fully priced in the back half of the year and those businesses that are exposed to raw materials, and that's why we're confident about the margin accretion potential.\nAndrew Obin: And is there any sort of incremental margin just as FX create some incremental headwinds? Is there an incremental margin of safety from commodity decline, as we think about towards exiting the year?\nRichard Tobin: That's too complicated for me, Andrew. Over the last, what, couple of weeks, we've watched a significant devaluation of the euro against the dollar and we were modeling if that pace was to continue. it's pretty drastic. So as Brad mentioned, I think there's been some recovery and some noise out of the ECB about raising interest rates, buffering that impact. But it's -- we're going to have to see. And remember, too, that we're going to convert at average rates. So you got to be careful about taking spot rates and then trying to run the mass on the second half of the year.\nBrad Cerepak: But I would just add that as it relates to price commodities. I feel good about the fact that all of our price actions are enacted going into this back half. And so we'll see what happens with commodities. I mean that's basically all we can say is, we'll see.\nAndrew Obin: Rich, Brad, always a pleasure. Thanks.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Hello Rich Tobin and Brady.\nRichard Tobin: Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey just two from me. First, Rick, just on the Belvac situation. We tend to think of the customers, Coke Pepsi, Crown, Ball, etcetera. So a little surprised to hear if somebody had a financing issue. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on what happened there? And then maybe the backfilling you're talking about is somebody stepping in and taking those slots.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean the -- look, capacity has been constrained and can-making for three years now, right? And that's what's been driving a lot of the capital investment by the can makers. But what you've also seen is a lot of companies that rather than go into the can makers are vertically integrating. That happened to be a particular project in Eastern Europe, which was a vertical integration play with the blow-up of the equity markets and financing conditions changed. The order got cancelled. But having said that, like I said, subsequent events, we got a $40 million order last week. So we had to debook it. That's life. None of the revenue and earnings for that particular order impact 2022. That was actually a 2023 project.\nJeff Sprague: Right. Interesting. And then just on the trajectory for the year here, I mean, clearly what you're saying about price cost and trends would indicate a sequential improvement in Q3 versus Q2, but you also are signaling a little bit more Q4 waiting? Could you just give us a little more color on how you expect the back half to play out here just to make sure we're all properly triangulated?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. Look, I mean, at the end of the day, this was the quarter where we really had to chin the bar because that was the highest profitability quarter since the demerger or the spin-off that we had to chin the bar to the extent that we chin the bar considering everything was going on. This is the one we're probably most worried about this year, and we chin the bar. So my comment on just the seasonality of the back end of the year, you can see the chart that we put into the presentation. I would just caution that because of this issue about all this work in process that we have, I would expect that to continue through Q3, meaning that we're going to actually pushing a lot more out the door in Q4 than we historically have been. As you know, generally speaking, we would kind of run flat out and then run for cash in Q4 historically. The supply chain issues are not repairing themselves, at least sitting here today at the speed that would allow us to deplete a significant part of our backlog and our WIP in Q3. So it's going to move into Q4, which is all baked into the full year forecast. So it was more of a comment that'll just be not that we give a damn about quarterly results. We're a full year company here. But I think that Q4 will be higher proportionally in terms of earnings than the historical trend.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hey Scott.\nScott Davis: Sharp move we saw on FX. I mean, is there a point where there's a demand destruction, challenge is, Is there and perhaps maybe framing how much of your product is kind of moving from dollar based regions to non-dollar based regions and be helpful in that regard? But is there a certain point where you start to get nervous?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I'm more nervous about the European macro than I am about FX. We don't ship hardly anything from the U.S. into Europe, where we run into problems with Euro dollar of any consequence. It is a bit of a -- and I don't think that there's a significant competitive advantage that we've been taking advantage of, a lower dollar versus the euro over time. So, I don't from a demand point of view, I don't think FX is an issue. I think that European macro is more of an issue. We don't see the effects of it today. But I mean, we're not naive and things aren't great with energy costs, where they are and everything else there.\nScott Davis: And how about emerging markets, where perhaps they have to buy in U.S. dollars, the product?\nRichard Tobin: Again, we do a lot of four regions in region. The products that we ship into emerging markets are most how do I want to put this? I mean there is no Asian competitor for Maag, for example. So we come under some pressure from a pricing point of view, maybe in the future if we assume that currencies -- the dollar remains strong against emerging market currencies. But right now, I think that between some of the bigger capital goods side, like the Maags and the Belvacs of the world, I think we can weather that.\nScott Davis: Okay, and then just quickly last, the printing ID business, any of your consumer goods, customers, delaying orders or talking about, any slowdown demand there?\nRichard Tobin: No, not really. I mean we just had some operational problems. We in Q2. I mean we are levered from a production point of view to Asia, to China specifically. So we've had some mission. We had to shut our operations down there in Q2 for a period of time during the lockdown. And we are caught up in some of the supply chain on electronics components there that we ended the quarter with a decent improvement there. So I would expect that at least on the on the printer portion of the business will catch up in the second half. We do not see a deterioration on the consumable side.\nBrad Cerepak: I'd say we lost in that segment about four points of growth, because of the shutdowns in China and the component supplies within that business, which catches up in the back half.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you, Brad. Thanks, Rich. Take care.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Rich, can we start on pricing and the expectation? First for the rest of the year, I think you used up at six points of price this quarter. And then there's a lot of discussion right now around base metal prices are deflating. How are companies -- are companies going to have to give back some pricing as commodities deflate? Can you maybe just provide some context for how that's going to work across your business?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, it's going to be an interesting dynamic and number one. Price cost, inflects materially positive in the second half, all of our pricing is done for the year. So what -- any pricing action we're taking now is more of a 2023 issue. Raw materials costs are coming down. We are not, we didn't reprice our backlog, into the headwind. And we have no intention of repricing our backlog into the tailwind. And that is something that's been an active dialogue with our customers now for seems like forever. But I guess, the last year if prices have to come down, because raw materials are deflating, that's actually positive to margins. Because, if we look at price cost on a rolling 12-month basis, you basically took a big headwind in the back half of last year into the Q1 of this year, and then you get a tailwind in the balance of the year, end up mostly, at least on the capital goods side, a net neutral over time. It's just you have the spread between the liquidation of the backlog timing. So if it comes down in pricing, yes, it is a headwind to revenue, but it's actually a positive to operating margin.\nJoe Ritchie: And maybe this kind of following up on the piece of the business, it's not backlog sensitive. So most of most of your business, right, this short cycle piece, would you expect to be this, in a deflationary backdrop, dollar neutral, would you be dollar positive, I\u2019m just trying to trying to get a sense when you get to keep some of it as we kind of progress over the next 12 months.\nRichard Tobin: Yes, on the short cycle portion of the business, I wouldn't expect that there's not that dynamic of input cost tied to market pricing. I mean, that's really the capital goods portion of the business, both us ourselves and our customers. That is an on-going dialogue, just because of the proportionality of the input costs. And you can see what the diamond is on the raw material side and the short cycle portion of the business. There is not that direct link. So I mean, barring the competitive environment big becoming incredibly aggressive in 2023, I would expect, it's our intention to keep the pricing that we've laid in.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. No, that's helpful. If I could just squeeze one more in. Just the fund process margins finally saw some degradation this quarter, you guys have been kind of calling out mix in that business for the last couple of quarters. Is this kind of like the right new level, this like 31% type margin? Do you expect further degradation in the coming quarters?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Look, I mean, let's not get into quarter-to-quarter performance. I think that we've been clear over the last 18 months or so, that 30% margin is pretty much the new normal. There'll be some volatility quarter by quarter, clearly, based on mix. And it's not all bad at the end of the day. I think on the biopharma side, the demand as our customers convert is going to be slow, as I said, in the second half of the year. We believe in terms of our ability to retain our share of that marketplace is absolutely solid we're speced [ph] in and a significant amount of our customer base. So it's just as biopharma transitions. And remember, too, there's other portions of that business that are dilutive to that margin. So when we post organic growth number, I believe it was 7% more or less in DPS for the quarter. A lot of that growth was from the industrial component side, which is dilutive to that margin. We don't try to manage segment margin. Basically, we're pushing all these companies as much as we can. So if we have dilutive mix, that's not necessarily a bad thing. We want every piece of that segment to grow over time. And we're actually quite pleased with the performance of Maag. As I mentioned, that is its backlog is going up well into '23 now and the turnaround that we're seeing in Precision Components, which is levered to the energy sector.\nJoe Ritchie: Makes sense. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys, good morning. Just to be clear, on kind of these price cost questions, I think, I think Andrew was trying to ask about when you guys would see deflation, given where commodity prices are today, I interpret your answer as it's not like you're seeing it in the second half, that's more price catching up with the inflation. So at what point would you see lower steel, lower copper, run through your revenue line item? Six months, nine months, 12 months? Like what's the timing on that? Just to be clear on that answer?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. I guess now we're going to go operating company by operating. I'll give you two examples. I mean, I think in [Indiscernible] because that has got an inflator deflator that probably rolls every 90 days or quarterly, you would begin to see that a little earlier. Its net neutral, in [Indiscernible] in terms of its operating margin, or its performance. And the other capital goods sides specifically on ESG, we wouldn't see that until mid-next year, probably based on backlogs.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So kind of blended for the cap goods businesses, 6 months?\nRichard Tobin: Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Yes. So beginning to give next year. So you're not seeing that in this year as a point and that's mostly price catching, right?\nRichard Tobin: I think it's completely manageable. I mean the -- the issue is going to be what happens to the competitive environment going into 2023, and we'll see there depending on what demand looks like. For us, I like where we stand in terms of our competitive stacks, right? The vast majority of our business have very few global competitors, and I don't expect to see if demand comes down, then you've got some significant headwinds in terms of the pricing environment from a competitive point of view outside of what's happening in raw materials.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then just a question on orders. Your reported orders, including that the backlog, the cancellation. So are you saying that those orders next in the third and -- or just the run rate for the second half that those will actually be up sequentially because of that impact of the $75 million or whatever it is or maybe you can just follow on what sequential orders.\nRichard Tobin: What I can tell you is that the bar that we had to chin for margin and operating profit and order volume was Q2, right? So we've been guiding for a year now that this can't go on forever and orders are going to come down. But if you noticed, I'm sure you did, that our backlog didn't deplete at all. And I think what Brad was trying to call out; you got to be really careful going forward here because FX has an impact not only on revenue and profit translation, but on balance sheets also. So -- and Roland over to take care of that over time. Again, I'm not worried about our orders. I mean we've got a significant portion of our portfolio that's sold out for the year.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So can book-to-bill be above 1 on a reported basis for the next couple of quarters?\nRichard Tobin: Can it be? Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Is that in your forecast? Anything can happen here.\nRichard Tobin: Perfectly frank, I don't -- we don't measure projected book-to-bill, right? We've got revenue forecast and earnings forecast, but no one is running around trying to count orders into the future.\nSteve Tusa: Except us.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Well, we had a discussion around here about book-to-bill orders and backlog, whether that's too much is too much. But at the end of the day, look, this notion that order rates coming down is somehow a precursor of 2023 demand. I think I'd be very careful about that.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, thanks.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi Group.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Rich, maybe just to follow up on that. Can you give us a little more color into the puts and takes of your revenue guidance for the year? I know we just talked about currency and length, but you actually raised your organic growth guide for the year despite lowering expectations a little bit in DII and DPS. Does your higher organic growth forecast come from more momentum in specific businesses, DP, DCF? Or is it more confidence in supply chain easing?\nRichard Tobin: Well, let's see. Number one, the back half is actually an easier comp. I repeat myself again, Q2 was the comp that we had to chin and we actually grew over Q2. So if you take -- if you look at the growth that we posted for Q2, which was the highest bar that we had to chin. If you take a look at what happened in the second half of last year, right, in terms of absolute growth, we're in pretty good shape there. Brad went through what our estimates are on FX, and we're going to be like everybody else, we're just going to have to watch that as it progresses through the year. And look, if you take a look at our cash flow, which is negatively impacted by largely inventory, we've got a significant amount of not so much finished goods, but a lot of raw materials and whip. And our intention is to convert a significant portion of that, which means selling it at the end of the day, again, our backlog which is -- which drives the top line, and we are going to run like crazy between now and the end of the year to liquidate that inventory position, which should be really good for the cash flow going forward. I mean, the 1 watch point is going to be how much we ship in December and whether that gets hung up in receivables or not. But you know what, that's relevant, quite frankly, it's a timing difference. We're looking at the 1 that we're driving at the most is we've got to clear that whip out of inventory, which would have the knock on effect of clearing the raw material position that we have.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: And then, Rich, or Brad, maybe I can follow up on the cash flow. Obviously, you had your initial cash flow guide out there, 13% to 15% of sales. I know cash flow improved sequentially. But as you were just talking about, Rich, seems pretty back-end loaded. Any update on sort of that original guidance or how to think about cash flow conversion over the next couple of quarters?\nRichard Tobin: I look at -- Andy, it's basically what I said, right? There's nothing changed here about the cash flow dynamic. Our earnings are going up for the year. That's a positive. We have brought in more inventory because of all these supply chain issues. I'm not worried about it because our inventory position proportionately against the backlog that we have is fine. We're going to watch a significant portion of the inventory in the second half of the year. What happens in payables and receivables based on timing and everything else. I think the only watch point would be on the receivables balance at the end of the year, but then the world doesn't end on January 31, I'm not calling out that we've got an issue with the guidance, and we're going to drive towards making it. But look, I think from a cash flow point of view, we're in no different position than we've been in the past and our earnings are higher.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate it Rich.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome, Andy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski, Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey good morning guys. Rich, you mentioned there, I apologize I jumped on the call a couple of minutes late. Watching Europe maybe a little bit more closely than kind of worrying about macro at large. Anything in terms of progression through the quarter order rates, mix of business? I know there's a couple of particularly economically sense of the businesses there. I would think the retail fueling when you $8 a gallon gas maybe isn't feeling awesome. But anything there that you guys you feel a need to point out?\nRichard Tobin: No, nothing. It was just a comment on a watch item where I think the question was more, are we more worried about FX. FX is what it is at the end of the day. I don't think it changes the dynamic where we think it's a headwind of our ability to compete in the Euro zone because of some -- we're shipping dollarized products into Europe, we don't. Clearly, Europe, from a macro point of view, is a watch item. We're not naive here. We don't see it yet, but we're paying very close attention to it. And then we run a variety of scenarios depending on what we think could happen to demand, what we do to our cost structure. And that was the comments I made in the presentation of we've got a playbook here that says when things start moving, how quickly we can move and we believe that we can move faster to the macro balls.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess maybe some out a little bit more strategically. You've been talking about near-shoring or kind of broader supply chain investment by the industrial world for a while now. At the same time, you're seeing some of that, I guess, start to improve. Anything that you think with improvement people sort of forget about or move on from? How are you guys thinking about this transition maybe from like triage mode to how you want to address some of the supply chain issues on a longer-term basis?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Look, I mean we've been the recipient, unfortunately, in the first half of the year of our own suppliers going through that transition, which has led to some of the headwinds that we've seen. So I think from a longer-term perspective, it's healthy. So you see quite a bit of capital investment going in let's call into NAFTA for lack of a better word, but that's -- these are industrial products, and they're not easy to move around, and we're all kind of going through that transition. Interestingly, from a CapEx point of view, our CapEx-related businesses are very strong. So the order rates that we're seeing in Belvac and Maag and what's going on in Precision Components and what's going on in Refrigeration. Those are all, let's call them, CapEx-related businesses. And from a backlog perspective and a demand perspective, I mean, they're all sold out for the balance of the year, and we're actually booking into 2023. So I know there's a big debate going on out there between consumer recession versus industrial recession. The CapEx sitting here today, I think that we're more positive than negative in terms of CapEx demand or CapEx-related demand going into 2023.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Makes sense to me. Thanks.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: Maybe we'll just stay on that same CapEx theme. Any change in your thoughts regarding CapEx spending expectations for the year for you guys?\nRichard Tobin: Our own, no. No. I think that what we have modeled in for ourselves through the year is we're all done. So I mean I don't think we could we can't spend what we've got in the plan now. So no, I don't think barring a customer showing up and saying, I want X, which clearly we would invest behind right now, I think that we're done in terms of commitments we and you'll see it reflected in the cash flow as we go through the balance of the year.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And in reference to the early discussion about counting orders, can you talk a bit more about that single largest order. You said it was in pump in process, what the application is, how competitive and how might the margins shake out versus the segment normalized average?\nRichard Tobin: It's polymer processing where the order came from. It's in Asia and it's slightly dilutive to the consolidated margin but still very good margin.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And how competitive was that?\nRichard Tobin: It's -- they're all competitive. Having said that, it's better to be competing with against two other people versus 10 people. And by and large, the vast majority of the portfolio is competing against two or three people. So it's competitive, but not crazy.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And just last one, if I could. Last quarter, when we talked about pricing, Rich you said you might be pressing more along the lines of surcharges? And how has that played out?\nRichard Tobin: What, I don't -- I think that because of the dynamics of raw materials, we haven't had to do surcharges since then. I think it was an option that we were -- we are basically -- I think that when we had the discussion last time as we've done a significant a lot of pricing here. That's all modeled in the roll forward for the balance of the year. So kind of like our pricing was done, assuming what we have in our EPS forecast. And that I think the response to the question is, well, what if we see input costs go up again, what are you going to do. And the answer was, at this juncture, we'd probably take a look at doing surcharging. We've done some but very little. Because of the fact that we haven't seen a degradation, we actually it's more of a tailwind going forward input cost than it's been a headwind over the past year.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: Hey good morning all.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning, Brett.\nBrett Linzey: I wanted to come back to capital deployment. You made a comment about proactively evaluating other various alternatives. Could you just put a finer point on that? Is it buybacks, special dividend? What's all under consideration? And then if it is the buyback, would you consider levering up or was this just a balance between bolt-on buyback and free cash flow?\nRichard Tobin: I think that the capital markets would have to get pretty green before we levered up to do it. So it was more on deployable cash flow, meaning that if we were -- if our pipeline from an inorganic point of view was low that we would not sit on our projected cash flow balances for a prolonged period of time. And so then we have optionality for capital return to shareholders. Our bias there is share repurchase over doing a special dividend as we sit here today. But that's always a discussion with the Board of Directors.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. And then just shifting to the European pump business there. How large is that on a run rate basis currently and I know the order rates have been pretty good there. But can you just speak to the scope of further opportunity in that business, and then specifically, how Dover is competitively positioned for the opportunity?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, we don't really get into giving out revenues by segment because that's a slippery slope that these conference calls the last thousand years. It's a good -- it's material to the full year revenue. I think the reason that we called it out was the scale of the particular purchase order as a proxy for kind of CapEx demand going forward. So it's a good order proportional to the revenue. That business is sold out for the year. So it's all 2023 that we're booking for now. So it's a precursor for the solidity of that particular business' revenue stream going into 2023.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it along.\nRichard Tobin: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just I thought it would be useful to go back to the guide, maybe Brad, this is for you. So $0.10 from FX headwinds at current plan rates. It sounds like that's offset by a point better organic growth. Is there anything else in the plan that's moving around seems like taxes coming in a bit better. But anything on corporate, etcetera, that we should bear in mind?\nBrad Cerepak: No, I don't think so. I think corporate was a little bit favorable in the quarter for reasons of booking accrual rates and things of that nature, but corporate kind of gets back to a normal pace in the back half of the year. As I said, the headwinds is $0.10 versus our last expectation. That's built into our guide, same as it is on the revenue side. So revenue and earnings are reflective of what we said was our current thinking about FX rates. The organic increase, another way to think about that is we chin the bar in Q2. We had a good Q2. We see that helps us for the full year as well and solidifying price is also helpful. So there's no huge movements there. It's more refinement than anything else.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. That's great. And then, Rich, maybe for you or expansive question on Europe. The sort of the top-down view on Europe is dismal. The micro sort of company data is actually coming in a lot better. It's a little bit surprising. So just wondering what you're seeing on the ground in Europe. And I'm just wondering how concerned you buy prosper gas rationing NG inflation? And are you seeing anything sort of unusual in terms of behavior from customers in Europe right now?\nRichard Tobin: Nothing unusual. I mean we -- Europe is probably more levered for export than NAFTA is for us. So it's not the proportionality of Europe for Europe is actually lower than it is for NAFTA, which proportionately is very high. So there is a bit of a buffer there. So I mentioned before with Maag having a single biggest order European company that's shipping into Greater Asia, and that business remains strong. Look, it's hard to tell right now. We don't see a lot of negative -- negativity. We don't see any cancellations of orders that we have in backlog in Europe right now. It was just more of a -- when we talk to our customers and we talk to our employees, this isn't good and what's going to happen here. But right now, we don't see anything where things are rolling over. But clearly, we are running scenarios, a variety of them if Europe was to run into in some problems, what are we going to do? And like I mentioned before, I think that we've got a playbook that allows us to protect operating margins under a variety of demand scenarios. And I think we proved that in 2020. We would just run that same playbook back again. But I mean I wish I could be more specific. Right now, everybody is concerned on what's going on in the macro in Europe, but we don't see it rolling to a situation where it's overly negative yet.\nNigel Coe: Sounds great. Thanks Rich.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer period in Dover's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide six. The top bridge shows our organic revenue growth of 7% driven by increases in three of our five segments. FX was substantial at 4% or $74 million headwind to our revenue growth and is and also to our profitability, resulting in $0.08 negative EPS in the quarter. We expect FX to remain a headwind for the year compared to our prior expectations. In all changes in foreign currency translations from April until today are estimated to have a full year 2022 impact of an incremental $0.10. M&A contributed $49 million to the top line in the quarter a product of $84 million from acquisitions partially offset by $34 million from unified brands divestiture. We saw organic growth across the U.S. and Europe, Asia was flat organically in the quarter as China was down 4% driven principally by COVID lockdowns, offset by growth in other parts of the region. Our businesses in China have resumed operations and we are currently seeing recovery in production and regionally sourced components. On the bottom of the chart, bookings were down year-over-year primarily due to foreign exchange, and a one-off $74 million debooking in beverage can making due to customer financing limitations. Likewise, our backlog was negatively impacted by the aforementioned debooking, as well as a negative impact from FX. Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide seven. Before I get into the charts, I want to remind everyone we now exclude the impact of acquisition amortization accounting from our segment earnings, which avoids a deal related noise quarter-to-quarter and better aligns the basis of our segment earnings presentation with our consolidated adjusted EPS. This change had no impact to our GAAP earnings or adjusted EPS. Now to the charts. Segment earnings were up $9 million in the quarter, on improved volumes and price costs, though partially offset by supply chain constraints and foreign exchange headwinds. Segment margins were down 80 basis points. Adjusted net earnings improved by $10 million driven by higher segment earnings and favorable corporate expenses partially offset by higher taxes. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.5% for the quarter comparable to the prior year period. Discrete tax benefits were lower than the prior year at $4 million in the quarter or approximately $0.03 of EPS. This compares to discrete tax benefits of $0.08 in the second quarter of 2021. We expect our back half tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Our cash flow statement is on slide eight. Free cash flow declined in the first half of the year driven by working capital investments in inventory necessitated by the high backlog. Supply chain constraints exacerbated by input shortages preventing completion of some work in process inventory in the quarter, as well as higher receivable balances on growing sales. The quarter also included $43 million tax payment related to the sale of Unified Brands. Capital expenditures were up year-over-year and are principally in support of our robust growth expectations across several businesses. Free cash flow was 6% of revenue in the quarter and would have been 8% excluding the UB tax payment. We expect cash conversion to improve in the second half of the year more in line with typical cash conversion seasonality in our businesses, driven by earnings, conversion and inventory reductions. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Well, okay, I'll take that. Within the quarter, the impact was about $0.02 of our -- against our expectations. I said for the full year, from here forward, it would be about $0.10. And I think you're asking me specifically what kind of forecast rate are we using. I could say we're using a euro of about $1.05. Today, it's trading at about $1.02. So maybe the headwind is a little bit higher. But we'll see. We'll see what happens now going forward, especially with the ECB raising rates. But I would just add that as it relates to price commodities. I feel good about the fact that all of our price actions are enacted going into this back half. And so we'll see what happens with commodities. I mean that's basically all we can say is, we'll see. I'd say we lost in that segment about four points of growth, because of the shutdowns in China and the component supplies within that business, which catches up in the back half. No, I don't think so. I think corporate was a little bit favorable in the quarter for reasons of booking accrual rates and things of that nature, but corporate kind of gets back to a normal pace in the back half of the year. As I said, the headwinds is $0.10 versus our last expectation. That's built into our guide, same as it is on the revenue side. So revenue and earnings are reflective of what we said was our current thinking about FX rates. The organic increase, another way to think about that is we chin the bar in Q2. We had a good Q2. We see that helps us for the full year as well and solidifying price is also helpful. So there's no huge movements there. It's more refinement than anything else."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everybody. Let's start with the performance highlights on Slide three. Our team delivered a strong second quarter performance, which related to record quarterly revenue and sequential year-over-year earnings growth. Consolidated organic revenue growth of 7% in the quarter as our businesses continue to capitalize on strong backlogs and pricing actions continue to take hold. We believe our ability to execute and provide needed capacity in today's challenging environment has led to noteworthy share gains in multiple markets, which is positive for our continued growth. Components shortages and COVID lock downs and China did negatively impact shipping volumes and consequently efficiency and fixed cost absorption and several businesses during the period, despite these difficulties, as well as FX headwinds are absolute segment profit increased year-over-year, and operating margin improved sequentially in the quarter driven by cost controls good volume and meaningfully improving price cost dynamics. Our strong balance sheet provides flexibility for value creating capital allocation initiatives. We're investing in capacity expansions and productivity improvements across many of our operating companies to capitalize on secular revenue growth opportunities, capture market share and drive improvements in operational performance. The recently-announced Malema acquisition will enhance our biopharma business closed on July 1, and we continue our pursuit of attractive bolt on acquisitions. We also repurchased $85 million worth of shares in the second quarter will continue to proactively evaluate capital deployment alternatives through the remainder of the year. Our strong backlog and constructive demand outlook and execution playbook position as well to deliver growth in revenue and earnings amidst an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. We are maintaining our 2022 adjusted full year guidance of $8.45 to $8.65 per share. I'll skip slide four which shows the detailed quarterly results. Let's move on to Slide five to discuss segment performance. Engineered products revenue was up 19% organically in the quarter on broad base strength across the portfolio in major geographies as well as pricing actions. Margins were up 130 basis points sequentially, and we expect the trend to continue through the second half as price cost spread continues to roll forward. Clean Energy and Fueling volumes are driven by strength in Clean Energy components vehicle wash, and below-ground fueling components offset by the expected roll off of EMV related demand in North America, which peaked in the comparable quarter last year. Margins in the quarter were down year-over-year on lower volumes and constrained inputs and to a certain extent mix. The sequential margin improvement was significant, however, at 410 basis points versus last quarter driven by improving cost dynamics and product mix. In Imaging & ID volumes and our core marketing and coding business were constrained by electronics and other input shortages as well as COVID lock downs in China is offset growth in our serialization of brand management software businesses. FX is a material negative headwind to absolute revenue profits in the segment, given its large base of international revenue. Q2 margins and Imaging & ID were impacted by lower volumes and production stoppages in Asia, but improved sequentially. The team has done a good job in cost containment and finding alternative suppliers to alleviate supply chain constraints and we are confident about good margin conversion in the second half. Pumps and Process Solutions posted a 7% organic growth -- strong double digit growth in our core non-COVID biopharma business, as well as robust growth in medical and thermal connectors, industrial pumps polymer processing and precision components.  Operating margin in the quarter remains robust at 31% plus despite a mix shift towards industrial components. Top line and alignment and sustainability technologies continue to be strong, posting 11% organic growth on solid volume in heat exchangers and beverage can making as well as pricing across all businesses. Volumes and food retail were constrained by supply chain challenges which negatively impact cost efficiency and will result in shipments pushing out into Q4. Comparable and sequential margins were up in the quarter on better mix and price costs, though partially offset by production, efficiencies, and input shortages. As you can see we're marching towards our mid-teens operating margin target in this segment. I'll pass it on to Brad here. Right. Thanks Brad. Let's go to Slide nine. This slide is our current view of the demand outlook operational environment and margin drivers for the remainder of 2022 by segments. We expect top line and engineer products to remain robust based on elevated backlogs and implemented price increases. Vehicle services continues to see a constructive demand environment across all geographies with particular strength in North America. Demand for refuse collection vehicles and parts remains very strong, and our connected collections digital businesses significantly outperforming expectations. Our backlog includes fully implemented price actions that support the projected recovery and margins we expect volume productivity and improved price cost spread to be positive drivers of earnings accretion and margin improvement in the second half of the year. Clean Energy and fueling, we expect to see robust growth in the second half of the year after a roughly flat first half. We continue to see solid demand in North America for below-ground retail fueling, fuel transport vehicle wash and software solutions. Our acquisitions and clean energy components continue to outperform their year 1 acquisition models, and we have already begun to deploy capital in these businesses to expand capacity and improve productivity. We expect margin performance to improve in the second half on stronger volumes and mix, which will drive improved full year margins in this segment. We expect volumes in Imaging & ID to improve as component shortages is with China recovering from second quarter COVID shutdowns. We continue to work to identify alternative electronics providers to alleviate component bottlenecks going forward and we're beginning to see some inquiries and approve order rates for large scale printers and digital textile printing at positive development and industry that has experienced a prolonged recovery. We expect margin to improve in the second half and better volume and cost containment while keeping a close eye on FX. In Pumps & Process Solutions activity industrial pumps remain, solid polymer processing has booked several big projects to lay the foundation for a very strong second half. And we recently received our single largest order ever for the business in early July. Precision Components continues its upward trajectory in both bearings and compressor components across all geographies as investments in energy sector pickup. We expect the current below normal demand trend and biopharma to continue for the balance of the year as biopharma manufacturers finished transitioning their R&D pipelines and production systems from COVID related businesses to other growing biologic therapies. We expect Climate & Sustainability Technologies to post double-digit organic growth this year driven by its large backlog and pricing initiatives. Demand remains robust across all lines in food retail, while input shortages have hampered food retail shipments they are expected to improve, resulting in a catch up of deferred shipments into the second half of the year. Our heat exchanger businesses positioned well in strong order rates across all geographies and end markets, in particular, in the European heat pump business. In Belvac beverage packing equipment business continues to work through its record backlog. We have already been awarded new projects in Q3 to materially offset the deep working in Q2. We expect margins to improve year-over-year on volume leverage and positive price cost dynamics and normalizing supply chains. Let's go to Slide 10. I presented this slide at a recent conference, but it bears repeating, as not everyone attended the event and the topic continues to be actively debated. There is a view that booking rates of the sole predictor of demand and revenue growth and negative year-over-year bookings on top of a record 2021 are somehow spelling trouble. None of us know what the future holds, especially in the current environment, let's level set on the basics here. First, if you look at our revenue and bookings, they've historically been correlated. But because of demand wave coming out of the pandemic, coupled with extended lead times from supply chain issues and some change in product mix, our bookings jumped in 2021 to $9.4 billion, well ahead of our revenue last year and our guide for 2022 revenue. That resulted in backlogs that are at record highs, roughly double where they have normally been on a 12 months revenue basis. That, over time, should come down, which is healthy because it means we lead times are coming out and global supply chains are improving. Our backlog is sufficient to feed revenue growth for a significant period. And it's worth noting that our backlogs midway through the year are still higher than they were at the beginning of the year. And despite a decline in bookings our book-to-bill ratio so far this year is still above one and in line with historical trends. Our current booking and backlog trends should position us to enter 2023 on solid footing. Let's move to slide 11. And we show historical first half versus the second half margin performance. Historically, Dover has generated higher margins in the second half of the year. Last year was an anomaly as input inflation and supply chain constraints and COVID shutdowns hit the second half. Our sequential margin trajectory is upward and progressing largely as expected, and we remain confident that about the positive second half margin dynamics in line with historical seasonality, although I would note that Q4 will contribute more to absolute profits than normal on backlog and order timing and as we liquidate a large work in progress balances in inventory. Make no mistake; we remain concerned with the inflation trajectory and general macro backdrop and the different demand scenarios that are possible in 2023. We have a playbook to act decisively to adapt both from a cost structure and working capital perspective of the different demand conditions. But sitting here today, looking at our backlog, significant portions of our portfolio were sold out for 2022. So we would expect the order rates to inflect positively as we go into the second half. We have levers that are not demand dependent. We have positive contributions from our organic capital deployment and productivity initiatives in our four enterprise pillar efforts will positively contribute to next year's earnings. We also have very interesting and underappreciated portions of our portfolio where secular demand growth will outperform the broader industrial market. In closing, I'd like to thank my colleagues around the globe for their continued dedication to strong performance in a demanding operating environment. And Jack, I'll hand it back to you, and we can get to the Q&A. On the commodity side, we get the majority of it in the second half, right? So all of that has been in inventory for some period of time of what we've been waiting for is the pricing to roll forward. So we've seen a significant improvement in Q2. And the expectation is on the backlog. The raw materials being fully priced in the back half of the year and those businesses that are exposed to raw materials, and that's why we're confident about the margin accretion potential. That's too complicated for me, Andrew. Over the last, what, couple of weeks, we've watched a significant devaluation of the euro against the dollar and we were modeling if that pace was to continue. it's pretty drastic. So as Brad mentioned, I think there's been some recovery and some noise out of the ECB about raising interest rates, buffering that impact. But it's -- we're going to have to see. And remember, too, that we're going to convert at average rates. So you got to be careful about taking spot rates and then trying to run the mass on the second half of the year. Thanks. Jeff. Yes. I mean the -- look, capacity has been constrained and can-making for three years now, right? And that's what's been driving a lot of the capital investment by the can makers. But what you've also seen is a lot of companies that rather than go into the can makers are vertically integrating. That happened to be a particular project in Eastern Europe, which was a vertical integration play with the blow-up of the equity markets and financing conditions changed. The order got cancelled. But having said that, like I said, subsequent events, we got a $40 million order last week. So we had to debook it. That's life. None of the revenue and earnings for that particular order impact 2022. That was actually a 2023 project. Sure. Look, I mean, at the end of the day, this was the quarter where we really had to chin the bar because that was the highest profitability quarter since the demerger or the spin-off that we had to chin the bar to the extent that we chin the bar considering everything was going on. This is the one we're probably most worried about this year, and we chin the bar. So my comment on just the seasonality of the back end of the year, you can see the chart that we put into the presentation. I would just caution that because of this issue about all this work in process that we have, I would expect that to continue through Q3, meaning that we're going to actually pushing a lot more out the door in Q4 than we historically have been. As you know, generally speaking, we would kind of run flat out and then run for cash in Q4 historically. The supply chain issues are not repairing themselves, at least sitting here today at the speed that would allow us to deplete a significant part of our backlog and our WIP in Q3. So it's going to move into Q4, which is all baked into the full year forecast. So it was more of a comment that'll just be not that we give a damn about quarterly results. We're a full year company here. But I think that Q4 will be higher proportionally in terms of earnings than the historical trend. Welcome. Hey Scott. Well, I'm more nervous about the European macro than I am about FX. We don't ship hardly anything from the U.S. into Europe, where we run into problems with Euro dollar of any consequence. It is a bit of a -- and I don't think that there's a significant competitive advantage that we've been taking advantage of, a lower dollar versus the euro over time. So, I don't from a demand point of view, I don't think FX is an issue. I think that European macro is more of an issue. We don't see the effects of it today. But I mean, we're not naive and things aren't great with energy costs, where they are and everything else there. Again, we do a lot of four regions in region. The products that we ship into emerging markets are most how do I want to put this? I mean there is no Asian competitor for Maag, for example. So we come under some pressure from a pricing point of view, maybe in the future if we assume that currencies -- the dollar remains strong against emerging market currencies. But right now, I think that between some of the bigger capital goods side, like the Maags and the Belvacs of the world, I think we can weather that. No, not really. I mean we just had some operational problems. We in Q2. I mean we are levered from a production point of view to Asia, to China specifically. So we've had some mission. We had to shut our operations down there in Q2 for a period of time during the lockdown. And we are caught up in some of the supply chain on electronics components there that we ended the quarter with a decent improvement there. So I would expect that at least on the on the printer portion of the business will catch up in the second half. We do not see a deterioration on the consumable side. Thanks. Yes, it's going to be an interesting dynamic and number one. Price cost, inflects materially positive in the second half, all of our pricing is done for the year. So what -- any pricing action we're taking now is more of a 2023 issue. Raw materials costs are coming down. We are not, we didn't reprice our backlog, into the headwind. And we have no intention of repricing our backlog into the tailwind. And that is something that's been an active dialogue with our customers now for seems like forever. But I guess, the last year if prices have to come down, because raw materials are deflating, that's actually positive to margins. Because, if we look at price cost on a rolling 12-month basis, you basically took a big headwind in the back half of last year into the Q1 of this year, and then you get a tailwind in the balance of the year, end up mostly, at least on the capital goods side, a net neutral over time. It's just you have the spread between the liquidation of the backlog timing. So if it comes down in pricing, yes, it is a headwind to revenue, but it's actually a positive to operating margin. Yes, on the short cycle portion of the business, I wouldn't expect that there's not that dynamic of input cost tied to market pricing. I mean, that's really the capital goods portion of the business, both us ourselves and our customers. That is an on-going dialogue, just because of the proportionality of the input costs. And you can see what the diamond is on the raw material side and the short cycle portion of the business. There is not that direct link. So I mean, barring the competitive environment big becoming incredibly aggressive in 2023, I would expect, it's our intention to keep the pricing that we've laid in. Yes. Look, I mean, let's not get into quarter-to-quarter performance. I think that we've been clear over the last 18 months or so, that 30% margin is pretty much the new normal. There'll be some volatility quarter by quarter, clearly, based on mix. And it's not all bad at the end of the day. I think on the biopharma side, the demand as our customers convert is going to be slow, as I said, in the second half of the year. We believe in terms of our ability to retain our share of that marketplace is absolutely solid we're speced [ph] in and a significant amount of our customer base. So it's just as biopharma transitions. And remember, too, there's other portions of that business that are dilutive to that margin. So when we post organic growth number, I believe it was 7% more or less in DPS for the quarter. A lot of that growth was from the industrial component side, which is dilutive to that margin. We don't try to manage segment margin. Basically, we're pushing all these companies as much as we can. So if we have dilutive mix, that's not necessarily a bad thing. We want every piece of that segment to grow over time. And we're actually quite pleased with the performance of Maag. As I mentioned, that is its backlog is going up well into '23 now and the turnaround that we're seeing in Precision Components, which is levered to the energy sector. Sure. I guess now we're going to go operating company by operating. I'll give you two examples. I mean, I think in [Indiscernible] because that has got an inflator deflator that probably rolls every 90 days or quarterly, you would begin to see that a little earlier. Its net neutral, in [Indiscernible] in terms of its operating margin, or its performance. And the other capital goods sides specifically on ESG, we wouldn't see that until mid-next year, probably based on backlogs. Yes. I think it's completely manageable. I mean the -- the issue is going to be what happens to the competitive environment going into 2023, and we'll see there depending on what demand looks like. For us, I like where we stand in terms of our competitive stacks, right? The vast majority of our business have very few global competitors, and I don't expect to see if demand comes down, then you've got some significant headwinds in terms of the pricing environment from a competitive point of view outside of what's happening in raw materials. What I can tell you is that the bar that we had to chin for margin and operating profit and order volume was Q2, right? So we've been guiding for a year now that this can't go on forever and orders are going to come down. But if you noticed, I'm sure you did, that our backlog didn't deplete at all. And I think what Brad was trying to call out; you got to be really careful going forward here because FX has an impact not only on revenue and profit translation, but on balance sheets also. So -- and Roland over to take care of that over time. Again, I'm not worried about our orders. I mean we've got a significant portion of our portfolio that's sold out for the year. Can it be? Yes. Perfectly frank, I don't -- we don't measure projected book-to-bill, right? We've got revenue forecast and earnings forecast, but no one is running around trying to count orders into the future. Yes. Well, we had a discussion around here about book-to-bill orders and backlog, whether that's too much is too much. But at the end of the day, look, this notion that order rates coming down is somehow a precursor of 2023 demand. I think I'd be very careful about that. You're welcome. Good morning. Well, let's see. Number one, the back half is actually an easier comp. I repeat myself again, Q2 was the comp that we had to chin and we actually grew over Q2. So if you take -- if you look at the growth that we posted for Q2, which was the highest bar that we had to chin. If you take a look at what happened in the second half of last year, right, in terms of absolute growth, we're in pretty good shape there. Brad went through what our estimates are on FX, and we're going to be like everybody else, we're just going to have to watch that as it progresses through the year. And look, if you take a look at our cash flow, which is negatively impacted by largely inventory, we've got a significant amount of not so much finished goods, but a lot of raw materials and whip. And our intention is to convert a significant portion of that, which means selling it at the end of the day, again, our backlog which is -- which drives the top line, and we are going to run like crazy between now and the end of the year to liquidate that inventory position, which should be really good for the cash flow going forward. I mean, the 1 watch point is going to be how much we ship in December and whether that gets hung up in receivables or not. But you know what, that's relevant, quite frankly, it's a timing difference. We're looking at the 1 that we're driving at the most is we've got to clear that whip out of inventory, which would have the knock on effect of clearing the raw material position that we have. I look at -- Andy, it's basically what I said, right? There's nothing changed here about the cash flow dynamic. Our earnings are going up for the year. That's a positive. We have brought in more inventory because of all these supply chain issues. I'm not worried about it because our inventory position proportionately against the backlog that we have is fine. We're going to watch a significant portion of the inventory in the second half of the year. What happens in payables and receivables based on timing and everything else. I think the only watch point would be on the receivables balance at the end of the year, but then the world doesn't end on January 31, I'm not calling out that we've got an issue with the guidance, and we're going to drive towards making it. But look, I think from a cash flow point of view, we're in no different position than we've been in the past and our earnings are higher. You're welcome, Andy. No, nothing. It was just a comment on a watch item where I think the question was more, are we more worried about FX. FX is what it is at the end of the day. I don't think it changes the dynamic where we think it's a headwind of our ability to compete in the Euro zone because of some -- we're shipping dollarized products into Europe, we don't. Clearly, Europe, from a macro point of view, is a watch item. We're not naive here. We don't see it yet, but we're paying very close attention to it. And then we run a variety of scenarios depending on what we think could happen to demand, what we do to our cost structure. And that was the comments I made in the presentation of we've got a playbook here that says when things start moving, how quickly we can move and we believe that we can move faster to the macro balls. Yes. Look, I mean we've been the recipient, unfortunately, in the first half of the year of our own suppliers going through that transition, which has led to some of the headwinds that we've seen. So I think from a longer-term perspective, it's healthy. So you see quite a bit of capital investment going in let's call into NAFTA for lack of a better word, but that's -- these are industrial products, and they're not easy to move around, and we're all kind of going through that transition. Interestingly, from a CapEx point of view, our CapEx-related businesses are very strong. So the order rates that we're seeing in Belvac and Maag and what's going on in Precision Components and what's going on in Refrigeration. Those are all, let's call them, CapEx-related businesses. And from a backlog perspective and a demand perspective, I mean, they're all sold out for the balance of the year, and we're actually booking into 2023. So I know there's a big debate going on out there between consumer recession versus industrial recession. The CapEx sitting here today, I think that we're more positive than negative in terms of CapEx demand or CapEx-related demand going into 2023. Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Our own, no. No. I think that what we have modeled in for ourselves through the year is we're all done. So I mean I don't think we could we can't spend what we've got in the plan now. So no, I don't think barring a customer showing up and saying, I want X, which clearly we would invest behind right now, I think that we're done in terms of commitments we and you'll see it reflected in the cash flow as we go through the balance of the year. It's polymer processing where the order came from. It's in Asia and it's slightly dilutive to the consolidated margin but still very good margin. It's -- they're all competitive. Having said that, it's better to be competing with against two other people versus 10 people. And by and large, the vast majority of the portfolio is competing against two or three people. So it's competitive, but not crazy. What, I don't -- I think that because of the dynamics of raw materials, we haven't had to do surcharges since then. I think it was an option that we were -- we are basically -- I think that when we had the discussion last time as we've done a significant a lot of pricing here. That's all modeled in the roll forward for the balance of the year. So kind of like our pricing was done, assuming what we have in our EPS forecast. And that I think the response to the question is, well, what if we see input costs go up again, what are you going to do. And the answer was, at this juncture, we'd probably take a look at doing surcharging. We've done some but very little. Because of the fact that we haven't seen a degradation, we actually it's more of a tailwind going forward input cost than it's been a headwind over the past year. You're welcome. Good morning, Brett. I think that the capital markets would have to get pretty green before we levered up to do it. So it was more on deployable cash flow, meaning that if we were -- if our pipeline from an inorganic point of view was low that we would not sit on our projected cash flow balances for a prolonged period of time. And so then we have optionality for capital return to shareholders. Our bias there is share repurchase over doing a special dividend as we sit here today. But that's always a discussion with the Board of Directors. Yes, we don't really get into giving out revenues by segment because that's a slippery slope that these conference calls the last thousand years. It's a good -- it's material to the full year revenue. I think the reason that we called it out was the scale of the particular purchase order as a proxy for kind of CapEx demand going forward. So it's a good order proportional to the revenue. That business is sold out for the year. So it's all 2023 that we're booking for now. So it's a precursor for the solidity of that particular business' revenue stream going into 2023. All right. Thanks. Nothing unusual. I mean we -- Europe is probably more levered for export than NAFTA is for us. So it's not the proportionality of Europe for Europe is actually lower than it is for NAFTA, which proportionately is very high. So there is a bit of a buffer there. So I mentioned before with Maag having a single biggest order European company that's shipping into Greater Asia, and that business remains strong. Look, it's hard to tell right now. We don't see a lot of negative -- negativity. We don't see any cancellations of orders that we have in backlog in Europe right now. It was just more of a -- when we talk to our customers and we talk to our employees, this isn't good and what's going to happen here. But right now, we don't see anything where things are rolling over. But clearly, we are running scenarios, a variety of them if Europe was to run into in some problems, what are we going to do? And like I mentioned before, I think that we've got a playbook that allows us to protect operating margins under a variety of demand scenarios. And I think we proved that in 2020. We would just run that same playbook back again. But I mean I wish I could be more specific. Right now, everybody is concerned on what's going on in the macro in Europe, but we don't see it rolling to a situation where it's overly negative yet. You're welcome."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director, Investor Relations. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consensual recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. And it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Sir, please begin.\nJack Dickens: Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of our call will be available on our website through May 12th and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for three months. Dover prepare -- provides non-GAAP information. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We make -- we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. I am on slide three, it shows the detailed U.S. GAAP and adjusted quarterly results. So let\u2019s go to slide four and take a look at the performance highlights. Our results in the first quarter were in line with expectations, our expectations. The demand for products and service continue to be robust across the portfolio and the management teams of our operating companies did a solid job of navigating various challenges during the quarter. Going into the quarter, we had appropriately forecasted the supply chain and input inflation headwinds, but we did not forecast significant geopolitical destabilization nor the return of pandemic challenges in China, which negatively impacted some businesses in our portfolio from a demand and supply chain perspective. We were able to largely offset these unexpected headwinds through robust production performance, particularly late in the quarter on the back of our backlog strength. Let\u2019s move to the next slide. Organic revenue was up 9% year-over-year in the quarter on strong demand across the majority of the portfolio. Backlogs remain at record levels up 54% year-over-year and 5% sequentially with book-to-bill above 1 in all five segments. Operating margin performance in the quarter was below our expectation. Planned volume leverage productivity and tight cost controls were able to dampen the forecasted negative impact of supply chain constraints and negative price costs embedded in older backlogs -- in older orders and the backlogs of certain businesses. But our actions were short of fully offsetting unscheduled production interruptions caused by supply chain constraints and severe weather events, which negatively impacted volume and cost absorption and had an unfavorable mix effect on margins. We expect this to be recovered over the balance of the year. During the quarter we continued to invest organically in capacity expansions and productivity initiatives to drive revenue growth and operational success. We recently acquired a unique intellectual property portfolio used in electric powered and hybrid waste collection vehicles, which we plan to showcase a fully electric refuse vehicle built for one of our municipal customers at WasteExpo in May. Our first quarter performance demonstrated again the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses and our commitment to continuous improvement in operational rigor. Due to the dynamic environment in which we are operating, quarter-to-quarter results will be noisy, which I am sure we will discus at length during the Q&A. But keep in mind that we have a robust backlog and that the businesses that face challenges in the back half of 2021 are positioned to drive robust performance as we get through the tougher comps of the first half of 2022. Despite the macro headwinds, we are well-positioned to deliver our full year revenue guidance of 7% to 9% organic growth and adjusted EPS of $8.45 per share to $8.65 per share. Let\u2019s go to slide five. Engineered Products revenue was up 15% organically in the quarter. Demand continues to be robust across much of the portfolio and we have considerable visibility as a result of backlog -- a robust backlog position. Comparable operating margin was down largely as a result of price cost and supply chain challenges, but sequentially improved, as production performance ramped up and older backlog shipped. We expect this dynamic to continue through the balance of the year. Clean Energy & Fueling was flat organically as the expected roll-off of EMA -- EMV demand in North America retail fueling was offset by growth in other businesses. Demand was strong across the balance of the portfolio of businesses with particular strength in Clean Energy components, vehicle wash, below-ground and fueling components. Let me unpack the margin performance here before we make this an EMV-only story and draw the wrong conclusions of the projected margin trajectory for the balance of the year. As we previewed last quarter, we incurred roughly $20 million in new acquisition related depreciation and amortization in the quarter driven by our Clean Energy acquisitions in late 2021. This represented a 400-basis-point headwind to segment margins in the quarter. The balance of the margin dilution is a result of product mix, which is EMV driven and Q1 supply chain and production challenges. Unfortunately, we lost a week of production in March due to weather event at one of our main production facilities in Texas. Setting aside acquisition accounting, we expect the segment to deliver robust absolute revenue and profits for the full year. Sales in Imaging & ID declined 1% organically as volumes in our core marketing and coding business were constrained by component shortages, as well as China lockdowns and reduction of business in Russia, more than offset growth in our serialization and brand management software businesses. Digital textile printing continued its gradual recovery. Q1 margins in Imaging & ID were down to lower volumes and higher input costs. Pumps & Process Solution posted another strong quarter at 13% organic growth. We saw strong volumes across all businesses and geographies. Demand remained strong in core biopharma activity where drug R&D projects, which that were sidelined during COVID, came back strongly. But we did see normalization in order rates for COVID driven biopharma components as demand for COVID-19 vaccines and therapies moderate. Margin performance was solid in the quarter on strong volumes, fixed cost absorption and favorable mix in pricing. Topline results in Climate & Sustainability Technologies continued to be robust, posting 17% organic growth and strength across all businesses in major geographies. Margins were up in the quarter as robust volumes, solid operating performance and improved price costs offset cost inflation and input shortages. I will pass it on to Brad from here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Going to slide six. On the top is the revenue bridge. FX was a 2% or $43 million headwind to the 9% organic growth, resulting in $0.05 of negative EPS impact in the quarter. Our FX forecast for the remainder of the year does not assume any changes to the prevailing exchange rates, which creates a headwind for the year versus our prior guidance. M&A contributed $53 million to the topline in the quarter, a product of $83 million from acquisitions partially offset by $31 million from the Unified Brands divestiture. We saw a solid organic growth across all geographies with notably strong performance in Asia and the Americas. China which represents approximately half of our business in Asia was up 20% organically in the quarter. Moving to the earnings bridge on slide seven. Adjusted segment EBIT was down $7 million in the quarter and adjusted EBIT margin declined 200 basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing were more than offset by input cost inflation, production stoppages, as well as acquisition-related amortization that drove a roughly 100-basis-point headwind. Adjusted net earnings improved by $13 million driven by higher segment EBIT, excluding AD&A and a favorable tax rate. The effective tax rate excluding discreet tax benefits was approximately 21.7% for the quarter, same as the comparable period. Discreet tax benefits were $10 million in the quarter or $4 million higher than in 2021 for approximately $0.03 of year-over-year EPS impact. Now on our cash flow statement on slide eight. Free cash flow declined in the first quarter and was slightly negative driven by working capital investments in inventory and heavy shipments in March, driving higher receivables, as well as higher compensation payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were principally in support of robust growth expectations across several businesses. Q1 is our season -- is seasonally our lowest cash flow quarter and Q1 last year was a bit of an outlier due to post-COVID recovery. With that, I am going to turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. I am on slide nine. This slide includes our current view of demand outlook, operational environment and margin drivers for the remainder of 2022 by segment [ph]. We expect topline in Engineered Products to remain robust, based on solid backlogs and sustained strong bookings. Vehicle services continues to ship against a record high demand, driven by new vehicle service facility builds, replacement of service equipment, growth in wheel aligners, as well as share gains. Orders for refuse trucks and software solutions are robust, with new order rates pushing well into the second half of the year. Momentum in industrial automation remains strong, particularly in China and within automotive, industrial winches continue to recovery with notable strength in natural resources and energy, and aerospace and defense will remain muted in Q2 on order timing but should accelerate in the second half. As expected, price cost was negative in the first quarter in this segment, but we expect it to flip positive in the second quarter as several rounds of price increases cycle through backlogs. We have also introduced other mechanisms to dampen the impact of margin cost volatility in our Capital Equipment businesses. All-in, we expect margins to improve sequentially as the year progresses. We expect Clean Energy & Fueling to post robust growth for the full year as solid growth in below-ground, fuel transport, vehicle wash and software solutions, coupled with our acquisitions in Clean Energy and components, which are off to a strong start, should more than offset the roll off of EMV demand. Excluding the $45 million of incremental deal-related amortization expenses in 2022, of which approximately $20 million were incurred in Q1, we expect full year margins to improve on volume and mix. Demand conditions in Imaging & ID are expected to remain solid as component shortages in core marketing and coding subside. Serialization and brand protection software should contribute positively to robust bookings and backlog. Digital textile printing is recovering. We expect margin in this segment to be stable. Order trends in Pumps & Process Solutions remained robust for much of the segment. Activity industrial pumps and polymer processing is solid and precision components continues its upward trajectory aided by increasing activity at refineries and petrochemical plants, and a recent uptick in orders for OEM gas compressor new builds. Our biopharma business remains strong, but likely lumpy intra-year from a demand perspective as our customers transition from COVID MNRA vaccine production to alternative therapies. Subject to year-to-year shifts in mix, we expect 30%-plus margin in this segment as the new normal going forward. We expect Climate & Sustainability Technologies to post double-digit organic growth this year driven by its large backlog in sustained order rates. New orders in core food, retail businesses have been healthy across product segments. Our case business within food retail is now booking into 2023. Our heat exchanger businesses positioned well on strong order rates across all geographies and end markets. And Belvac packaging equipment business continues to work through its record backlog. They are also booked for 2022 and are taking orders for 2023. Q2 and Q3 are seasonally strongest quarters for volumes and margins in the segment. We expect margins to improve significantly in 2022 on improved volume leverage, positive price cost dynamics and normalizing sequential. Okay. Here we go. This is the new slide and I am going to attempt to provide some clarity on bookings and backlog by segment, since this subject has been actively debated and I can see it continues to be this morning. First, total backlog is up 50% year-over-year with double-digit growth across all segments despite robust revenue performance in the last 12 months. All segments also posted sequential growth in backlog during Q1. Next, our book-to-bill in Q1 was 1.1, with all five segments above 1 despite 9% organic growth in the quarter. This is a very good picture. Topline visibility is a great thing from an operational and planning perspective, and it\u2019s an important pillar of our full year guidance. Intuitively, we would not expect these elevated order rates and advanced ordering patterns to persist, especially in the short cycle portion of our portfolio, as supply chains improve. But we see two factors influencing current order patterns. First, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that customers who expect persistent inflation will continue advance ordering to lock in favor -- in the attempt of locking favorable pricing. And second, customers expecting robust demand in 2023, while remain cautious on supply chain stability, want to ensure supply. As you can imagine, we spend a lot of time on this topic, and at present, do not have a conclusive view despite booking into 2023 in long cycle CapEx driven portions of the portfolio. So we will just have to adapt accordingly and keep a keen eye on working capital as the year progresses. I would however caution that we need to be careful about drawing definitive conclusions on changes in comparative order rates or backlogs. The scale of our typical operating company gives us significant flexibility to adapt the changes in the demand environment and we manage them all uniquely based on the operating model, business cycle and competitive stack. I am absolutely confident that we have the tools to maximize profitability to the upside scenario and to protect it on the downside as we approved in 2020 and 2021. Dover\u2019s portfolio has significant diversification from a product and end market exposure perspective, many of which we believe has secular growth tailwinds, and as such, despite the ongoing macro and geopolitical challenges at present, we are continuing to invest organically behind areas of strength. Moving to slide 11, again, we are reaffirming full year guidance for the year. And let\u2019s move on to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Jeff.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi. Good morning.\nJeff Sprague: Hi. Could -- I guess a couple things. I mean, first, Rich, you sound a bit more confident on price cost over the balance of year. You also mentioned kind of older backlog working its way through the system. I would imagine you have a pretty good handle on that, but maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on kind of the residual tension on converting existing backlog and some of these steps you said you took to kind of dampen the volatility on cost inputs going forward?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. Jeff, I mean, we were chasing price costs last year, and one of the good things that, I mean, the good news is having a high backlog, you get visibility, which is helpful to planning, let\u2019s say. The bad news is if that backlog is building in advance of input cost headwinds, you are chasing it to a certain extent. So, as you are basically -- without replacing backlog, right? You go negative price costs, which we saw in Q4 last year. If you remember what we talked about, at the end of the year, I said, the disappointing performance for us in Q4 was, because of supply chain, we did not convert as much backlog as we would have liked, which would have strangely, our revenue would have been up and our margin would have been down in Q4. And what we have done is we have carried some of that into Q1, and I think, if you remember, what we said about modeling Q1 this year was that it was a safe bet to model it against Q4 of last year, and if you go do the comparisons, we are pretty much spot on. But we are shipping that older backlog, right? So now we had so we are going to squeeze price costs in Q2 significantly and then flip significantly positive, at least in three portions of the portfolio on the back half of the year and particular in Engineered Products, in Clean Energy, and in Climate, where we expect to see a significant benefit in the back half of next year on price cost and because of the comps are significantly easier, right? I call your attention to our Q2 performance last year, I think, was the highest margin that Dover ever posted. So the comp that we have got ahead of us is a tough one. I would tell you that, I guess before somebody asks, again, I would point to Q2 last year as a proxy for performance of Q2 this year.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for that. And maybe just a little bit of kind of macro color for lack of a better term, I guess. But, obviously, the world feels different the last six weeks or eight weeks. I mean the backlogs and orders do look robust. But are you seeing any indication, trepidation from customers about taking backlog or shifting their places in line or anything that would kind of undermine your confidence in kind of the deliverability of the backlog?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I think that how my top concerns point of view, this China COVID situation is new news in the quarter that we have had to navigate here. I don\u2019t have a view on where this goes. I am hoping, based on the news this morning that we are not going to move on to Guangzhou or somewhere else, but that is not helping from a supply chain point of view. Look, so far, the pricing that we have passed has not been to the detriment of backlog. So we haven\u2019t had call offs in that backlog. I think the biggest issue for us is the supply chain side of the business. Does it get better or does it get worse from here? We will see. And from our customers\u2019 point of view, they again are dealing with supply chain issues and labor availability issues. So that\u2019s where you have got a lot of push and pull of, we are working really hard to get the product out the door and we are working really hard with our customers to make sure they are ready to receive at the same time, because they are dealing with their own call them supply chain issues. So right now we don\u2019t see it. We don\u2019t see much of a risk in terms of shipping our backlog other than our own constraints and so as far as the customer taking it, but we will see going from here.\nJeff Sprague: Great. I will leave it there. Thanks for the color. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hi. Good morning, Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: So DPPS, obviously, book-to-bill still positive, orders did turn down on tough comps and it looks like you have lowered your 2022 revenue forecast slightly in that segment and you called biopharma, I think, lumpy. Can you give us some more color on what percentage of DPPS has had? The COVID-related tailwinds and is normalizing versus the rest of the business, and ultimately, how are you thinking about Dover\u2019s overall ability to grow DPPS at this point?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. Think that we are going to go through a little bit of an air pocket here in terms of the demand function because of this transition from COVID therapies to non-COVID therapies. I think, on the long run, we believe that this is a growth market and I\u2019d like to thank Danaher for going before us, because I think, they explained it far better than we are going to be able to do it. But we expect in the middle of this year to have reduction in order rates as that transition takes place, that\u2019s accommodated into our earnings forecast for the year. But I don\u2019t believe that this is -- this COVID-related issue is an air pocket where revenues are going to drop never to be seen again. We think it\u2019s an intra-year conversion and we feel really good about our position in single use.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that, Rich. And then could you give us some more color into the improvement you see in DCST, obviously, revenue growth was strong in the quarter. Is it possible at this point to quantify how much added growth your initiatives in that segment are? CO2 systems, Belvac, SWEP, how much do they add to this business and then do you still see that segment hitting your mid-teens margin target for the year?\nRichard Tobin: The two-year CAGR on Belvac is now in the 40s. The two-year CAGR on heat exchangers is in the 20s. So it\u2019s not -- before we get to refrigeration. So you have got two big principal drivers, which are margin accretive to the segment, by the way. The two-year CAGR on refrigeration business is about 16.5, 17, and it\u2019s widespread across the portfolio, the fastest growing portion being the systems business. As we have discussed before, we will take all the system business we could get and we are trying to maximize the profitability on the case business. Meaning that we are trying to -- we are not running and taking all the business that\u2019s out there. So, so far, so good, still a lot of supply chain issues, because these are complicated assembly processes, but Q2 and Q3 margins should be interesting.\nAndy Kaplowitz: I guess I will leave it at that. Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just -- you said 2Q is going to look a lot like 2Q last year. What\u2019s the organic growth do you think in 2Q, I mean it was a pretty big step-up in 2Q last year, so maybe just over that?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. Look, I mean, I think, you can calculate that, right? If I say it\u2019s going to look similar at the end of the day. I don\u2019t have that at the top of my head. I know that from a data point, but I\u2019d have to go ask one of my colleagues here about trying to extrapolate that into organic growth. I can tell you it should be similar to Q1.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Okay. Sorry. Trying to do less work these days, looking for a little help there.\nRichard Tobin: Right.\nSteve Tusa: And so that means that kind of the back half you are looking at, I don\u2019t know, like, 7% -- 6% to 7%? And if that\u2019s the right number, that would imply, I guess, somewhere in the range of a 45% to 50% incremental for the back half of the year?\nRichard Tobin: Well, the back half of the year, the incrementals are going be significant, because the comps with all the operational difficulties that we had last year, I mean, we lap all that.\nSteve Tusa: Right?\nRichard Tobin: We are shutting down facilities and we had negative absorption. We had reduced volumes, negative absorption, everything else, and the beginnings of negative price costs. So if all things being equal, and the supply chain and the macro doesn\u2019t get worse from here, yeah, I mean our incrementals in the back half of the year, particularly in Engineered Products and in Clean Energy and in Climate should be robust?\nBrad Cerepak: Yeah. I would add to that, I guess\u2026\nRichard Tobin: Yeah.\nBrad Cerepak: I would add to that, I guess, to say, we will see where the macro goes on commodities. But as we think about the back half and the price material implications, I would say, our forecast now include impacted price. So I think we feel good about that under the scenario that the backlog\u2019s cleaning itself out and we have the price increases in place. So I think that\u2019s good news for the back half.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Sorry. One more on that detail, can you remind us how much of those, I recall you guys saying it was kind of a $30 million to $40 million kind of one-time-ish type of costs related to supply chain and then how big do you expect kind of that price cost spread to be in the second half? These -- those two items a little more precision there would be great?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, clearly, it\u2019s going to be that headwind plus. So you mop up all the headwind on a comp basis, plus you get normalized incremental margin on the volume.\nSteve Tusa: Yeah. How big is that? Can you remind me?\nRichard Tobin: I never told you. So there\u2019s nothing to remind you there.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.\nRichard Tobin: All right.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Scott.\nScott Davis: I was hoping you could educate us a little bit or me, I should say, on the biopharma business. When you think of -- I mean, all these biosimilars that are coming out, there\u2019s just a shit ton of them. If I walked into one of those facilities, would it have similar asset intensity to kind of the predecessor product? I mean, I guess, and the question is that, are they more -- just as like the use -- single use?\nRichard Tobin: Oh, boy. Well, like I tried to say before, we listen to Danaher, because we knew this was coming and I think that what they articulated was far better as -- we are a subcomponent supplier. What I will tell you is that, skid production in biopharma is very much a growth avenue, right? It grew because of COVID. But now these mRNA therapies have got a variety of different therapeutic uses and the chosen technology for production and our understanding is skid, and as such, we are component supplier to that chosen type of production.\nScott Davis: Okay. All right. That\u2019s super helpful. And then to back up, the electric garbage truck, is this -- I don\u2019t expect you can share on it? Can you make money making these things, are the specks -- are we a few years off from being able to actually, I am just picturing, the battery density has to be massive to be able to drive these things more than 20 miles. So any color there that you can help just to understand if that\u2019s a real market or not?\nRichard Tobin: I don\u2019t know. Maybe you and I can go down to WasteExpo on May 5th and go take a look at it. Look, we are not\u2026\nScott Davis: I will take a pass on that, Rich.\nRichard Tobin: I will meet you there.\nScott Davis: Let\u2019s put it that way.\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. We don\u2019t have a plane here, so I can\u2019t pick you up. Nonetheless\u2026\nScott Davis: Yeah.\nRichard Tobin: \u2026 remember, we are not a chassis builder. So this is\u2026\nScott Davis: Yeah.\nRichard Tobin: \u2026 a basically if you think about a hybrid, this is a battery pack that drives the compactor that sits on the back of the truck. So the use is, in theory, a full electric vehicle. So you have a full electric truck with this technology sitting on the back, but you could also have a diesel chassis with an electric -- so with an electric compactor, the guys that run this business are going to hate me for trying to describe it and you get basically a hybrid benefit. So are we going to make money on it? That\u2019s the intent. But the fact of the matter is, for municipalities, its taxpayer money at work here and if somebody decides they want to go to an electric fleet, they are going to go to an electric fleet, and as a material supplier, we have got to have a product offering.\nScott Davis: Yeah. Makes sense. All right. Thank you, guys. I will pass it on.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey. Rich, just a quick clarification just on the 2Q comment. So we are talking about like-for-like EPS, right, organic growth? It\u2019s going to be up, obviously, so margins down on a year-over-year basis 2Q?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. Look, I mean, I know, we have all these discussions about price cost and what\u2019s ignored there is the dilutive effect on price cost. Even at neutrality, it\u2019s dilutive to margins. So you are going to get that piece of it even if we were absolutely neutral across the entire portfolio and pricing has been robust. That\u2019s the math. That\u2019s the way the math works at the end of the day. Now, our portfolio is so diverse. It\u2019s a little bit all over the place and depending on how much commodity exposure we have in certain businesses and everything else. From an absolute profit point of view, I think, because Q2 was peak margins for -- I am going to get my years right now, 2021.\nJoe Ritchie: That\u2019s right.\nRichard Tobin: Even with that dilutive effect and absolute profit, Q2 is a proxy. But I\u2019d be careful about the margin.\nJoe Ritchie: Yeah. No. That makes a ton of sense. I guess the follow on there is really, I want to kind of parse out the Clean Energy & Fueling margin this quarter. So, clearly, we know the AD&A, the 400 basis points. Is -- so I guess two questions. One, are we going to see the rest of the depreciation and amortization come in in Q2? Is that going to be linear throughout the year? And then the second question, just maybe kind of help parse out a little bit more, I think, you guys talked like one week production being down in that business. And so how quickly can kind of see that ex-AD&A, how quickly can margins come back?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. I am going to leave the AD&A questions to my colleagues. I will deal with everything else and we can circle back on the linearity.\nBrad Cerepak: The -- well, I mean, to answer that question, the back half goes to a linear amortization amount at roughly $7 million a quarter. So if you are thinking about the second quarter, it\u2019s not as high as the first, because of the inventory rolls off into the second quarter, and we said it was 45 for the year, so you could do the math and squeeze the second quarter and that\u2019s as simple as I can make it.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. We will endeavor to remove AD&A from the segments going forward, our bad on that one. Nonetheless, look, Q1 was just a mess. I don\u2019t want to go back and revisit COVID. But in January, at our main production facilities, we weren\u2019t doing much. We rushed like hell to pump out as much as we could and we were actually at a pretty good pace, and then we lost a week of production in our main production facility above-ground dispensers in March because of hurricane. That\u2019s life. It should have happened in the quarter where we weren\u2019t taking $20 million of AD&A I guess. And our Clean Energy business, which no one understood and -- understandably no one understands the seasonality. Their actual lowest profit margin of the year is Q1, where we basically write orders for the balance of the year. So the backlog that we can see and the revenue trajectory that we can see for those business is very good, but is actually dilutive to prior year margins because of seasonality. So, from here, supply -- all things supply chain being equal, our below-ground business, which is very profitable is booked and our Clean Energy is all coming and that\u2019s accretive to margins and that is doing very well from a backlog point of view. So as long as we can get the product out the door, I am confident that full year absolute profit and margins performance will be robust despite EMV.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks. Thank you both.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi. Thanks.\nAndrew Obin: Well, just a question on volume versus pricing. In Q1, pricing was up 6% and it sounds it\u2019s going to get better. So if we sort of look into second half, if we look at the organic growth guidance with a powered sort of pricing, it implies relatively flat volume in the second half. Given how robust orders and backlog is, just wondering are you guys trying to gauge growth in the second half to optimize profitability, like, given this dynamic between price cost uncertainty to the backlog? Just trying to understand how you think about very robust backlog and volumes seemingly being flattish in the second half?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. I think that one could say that pricing that you have seen in Q1 remains linear over the balance of the year and the margin accretion in the second half is, because you flip positive because of inventory valuation, so, if you follow me. Meaning that\u2026\nAndrew Obin: Yeah.\nRichard Tobin: \u2026pricing is in. As we cycle the older inventory that is valued higher, you have got -- in Q4 and Q1 it was dilutive. It gets to neutrality, slightly positive and then it flips all things, assuming we get all the product out the door positive from there. So the growth rate for the full year, one could assume is somewhere in the 5% to 6% price-related and the balance being volume. But as you know, mix here, because of the diversity of the portfolio is going be quite different likely.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And then sort of a second question, how -- European growth was surprisingly robust this quarter sequentially, given all the news in Ukraine, how has your view changed on Europe and for the second half? And also maybe broadly, are we banking on North American growth and maybe less Asia and European growth in 2022? So your specific plan be just sort of mix between North America and the rest of the world? Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. I mean, the economic environment in Europe is a risk. But we can only look, the good news is that our backlogs in Europe are not as high as they are in North America, but they still remain good and our expectation is that we would ship off that, but clearly, we are going to watch order rates in Europe from here, if one adopts a scenario of the demand function in Europe getting worse from here. Look, Andrew, I mean, we could think of 100 different reasons to kind of tap down expectations for this year, whether that be, what\u2019s going to happen with COVID in Asia. What\u2019s going to happen with Russia, Ukraine in Europe? We are not assuming continued strength in the dollar versus some of our other trading currencies. But I think that would be a copout and it\u2019s too early to tell here. The good -- we are looking -- the challenge for us is to get the product shipped profitably from here. And that is up to us in the productivity side and it\u2019s up to us to work the supply chain things like crazy. But as I said in my prepared comments, we do this business-by-business and we are on it, right, in terms of tearing apart order rates and making sure that we don\u2019t get over our skis from a working capital perspective or anything else and we will see how it goes. Right now, we believe that we can meet our forecast for the year.\nAndrew Obin: Well, great. I appreciate that. I also appreciate the bookings [ph] early in the earnings season. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to start off with Imaging & ID, as I don\u2019t think that division has been touched on much yet, you took down the sales guide slightly, but had very good order growth actually in Q1 versus other businesses. So maybe help us understand on that revenue outlook, how much is just that soft start to the year on sales. Also, I think, there would be more conversation in your prepared remarks around component shortages in DII than perhaps what we have heard three months to six months ago, so any color around that. And how do we think about the margins kind of flipping around there may be as those shortages ease?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I will take the last one first. I think that we said that margins are going be stable on the full year. Look, we did have circuit board shortages in Q1, bad on us. And that was partially due by the fact that we sourced those from Asia, so the Asia lockdowns and we had to shut our production factory in Shanghai -- which is in Shanghai during the quarter. So we will pick up as much as we can out of there. To a certain extent, the geographical mix on that business is more levered towards consumer production in Europe. So we are being a bit cautious in the demand function, and, again, I don\u2019t want to bring up this translation issue again, but that\u2019s part of it also. So, overall, I mean, this is a business that grows low-to-mid single digits at pretty much constant margins, although I will give the management team a lot of credit, over the last couple years, they have driven margins up nicely, our expectation for this year, probably that kind of performance, low single-digit growth at healthy margins and excellent cash flow. But it\u2019s going be a little choppy base on macro and supply chain.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a question on inventories, one more for Brad and one for you, Rich. But, I guess, Dover\u2019s own inventories, you had the big working capital headwind, free cash flow was very soft in Q1. How quickly does that reverse? And then maybe for Rich, what we often hear from a lot of multi-industry companies is their own inventories are sky high, their customer distributed inventories are rock bottom. Maybe help us understand how you see that delta today regarding Dover?\nRichard Tobin: Okay. You want me to take it first?\nBrad Cerepak: Go ahead. Sure.\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. All right. As a portfolio comment, we do not believe that our inventories are reflective of our distribution network inventories. Meaning pretty much what we ship out the door kind of passes through distribution. Our inventories are high, clearly, but so is our backlog, right? So the way that we look at those inventories is. Before -- I am just talking about physical inventory before we get into working capital, that\u2019s something else. But to the extent that we ship that backlog, which we have every intention of doing that those inventories will moderate. And you also need to take into account that inflation has an impact on absolute dollar value of inventories, right? So it\u2019s very nice that everybody\u2019s talking about raising prices and everything else. But that needs to be taken into account when you look at year-over-year change in inventory because the absolute value of that inventory has gone up significantly.\nBrad Cerepak: And I think the only thing I would add is the sequence of cash flow is more like it\u2019s been in years past, which is fourth quarter being our highest quarter of cash flow and we will progressively pace through the year where we will see free cash flow increase from Q2 into Q4. But, again, I think, as Rich said, we -- and we said in our prepared comments, the balance sheet will have some liquidation to it in the sense of we had very high receivables because of the high shipments in March coming off of a low January. So just time wise, the collection period falls into the second quarter and then you also have inventory which will continue, I think, to come down over the course of the year as we ship across the backlog.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s perfect. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Rich, do you think you will need any more price this year, I know there\u2019s been some lumpiness in some of the input costs, particularly things like freight over the past 90 days. But maybe like freight surcharge aside, are you guys where you need to be on price?\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. You should hear the yelling and screaming that goes on about pricing sometimes around here.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: I listen to the calls, there\u2019s plenty.\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. I don\u2019t think so. I think that any pricing from here, especially in the capital goods side, is going be surcharge and not absolute price. But we will see. I mean, if you tell me what the trajectory of inflation\u2019s going be over the balance of the year. I mean, that\u2019s one of the watch points. I mean, I think, what good news, bad news on inflation, is the way that we look at it, is inflation looks to be moderating, except the fact that we have got a trillion plus of infrastructure and American Rescue Plan coming our way. And what does that mean? It\u2019s hard to say right now. I think, the good news is, does that -- is that good from the demand point of view in certain business like ours? Yes, it is, right, because it\u2019s where we have got a big portion of our portfolio that\u2019s tied to CapEx. What does that mean from an inflation point of view? All bets are off there. So it\u2019s an interesting dynamic. I don\u2019t, so I guess to answer your question is, I think that we are going to be very selective from here and if it\u2019s commodity price driven, it\u2019s likely to be surcharge based.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Super helpful. And then some nuisance on the margin kind of expectations from here, especially with the traffic light commentary in the slide deck. Relative to where we were coming out of fourth quarter, any change to how you see either the full year or the cadence in DP or DPPS?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, look, that was in, perhaps, DPPS, like, biopharma demand is probably intra-year going to be a bit light. So I think that nobody should fall out of their chairs if order rates go down there some. The balance of that portfolio is actually order rates are picking up quite nicely. Now that\u2019s slightly dilutive to biopharma, but not to the extent where people saying that we are over earning and we are going to go back to historical margins. So I think if you go back and take a look at transcript, I\u2019d say that, 30% plus is the new normal here. So we will be able to absorb it. Where we are looking and I will -- where we are looking for and it should make sense when you go back and take a look at the calendarization of earnings last year, where we are looking for absolute profit performance, 2022 versus 2021 is in Engineered Products, Clean Energy and into the Climate side of the business. We are not looking for a lot of year-over-year incremental profit from the other two segments. There\u2019s going be some, but that\u2019s not going to be the principle driver, because, quite frankly, those two businesses more or less sailed through 2021.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Okay. Thanks.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I dropped off for 10 minutes, so I apologize if I am repeating any questions here. But your configuration margins, sorry, the Clean -- I can\u2019t remember the new name of the segment. But best margin since -- 1Q margin since 2013. So, curious maybe you have talked about significant margin expansion this year in that segment. Just wondering, do you think we are going to be in mid-teens zone for the full year?\nRichard Tobin: Oh! For the segment? Sure.\nNigel Coe: Yeah. Okay. And then -- nice quick answer there. And then turning back to the Fuel, and sorry, I should know these by now, shouldn\u2019t I, but the Clean...\nRichard Tobin: Yeah. Yeah. I know what you are talking about. Go.\nNigel Coe: You called out mix as a significant headwind there, and obviously, the weather impact on the production facility. Given the acquisitions of RegO and Acme, I mean, I thought they were low-20s EBITDA margins, Rich. So just wondering, is there any seasonality to those businesses or was the mix impact elsewhere more than offsetting that contribution from those acquisitions?\nRichard Tobin: Well, you answered the question. Yes, there is seasonality in the acquired businesses. Q1 is actually the lowest margin quarter. So supply chain and COVID issues aside in Q1, the -- what we expect is we rollout of EMV demand in Q2, which is probably the peak for EMV demand for last year, which is margin accretive, but we basically offset that over the balance of the year and then some through the acquired revenue and profits and the fact that our underground business and vehicle wash and everything else start shipping significantly through the year and that\u2019s against a comp in the second half of last year where it was weak.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then maybe just one more, a question we are getting a fair amount, not just for Dover but across the group. U.S. CapEx and just maybe it\u2019s a question for Brad. Are you -- within your CapEx budgets, are you shifting more CapEx into the U.S. relative to elsewhere?\nBrad Cerepak: No. Not significantly, although CapEx is -- in our growth-oriented businesses, if you think about the ones we are talking about that have the higher growth profiles, that\u2019s where the CapEx is.\nNigel Coe: Okay.\nOperator: And thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Going to slide six. On the top is the revenue bridge. FX was a 2% or $43 million headwind to the 9% organic growth, resulting in $0.05 of negative EPS impact in the quarter. Our FX forecast for the remainder of the year does not assume any changes to the prevailing exchange rates, which creates a headwind for the year versus our prior guidance. M&A contributed $53 million to the topline in the quarter, a product of $83 million from acquisitions partially offset by $31 million from the Unified Brands divestiture. We saw a solid organic growth across all geographies with notably strong performance in Asia and the Americas. China which represents approximately half of our business in Asia was up 20% organically in the quarter. Moving to the earnings bridge on slide seven. Adjusted segment EBIT was down $7 million in the quarter and adjusted EBIT margin declined 200 basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing were more than offset by input cost inflation, production stoppages, as well as acquisition-related amortization that drove a roughly 100-basis-point headwind. Adjusted net earnings improved by $13 million driven by higher segment EBIT, excluding AD&A and a favorable tax rate. The effective tax rate excluding discreet tax benefits was approximately 21.7% for the quarter, same as the comparable period. Discreet tax benefits were $10 million in the quarter or $4 million higher than in 2021 for approximately $0.03 of year-over-year EPS impact. Now on our cash flow statement on slide eight. Free cash flow declined in the first quarter and was slightly negative driven by working capital investments in inventory and heavy shipments in March, driving higher receivables, as well as higher compensation payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were principally in support of robust growth expectations across several businesses. Q1 is our season -- is seasonally our lowest cash flow quarter and Q1 last year was a bit of an outlier due to post-COVID recovery. With that, I am going to turn it back to Rich. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Yeah. I would add to that, I guess... I would add to that, I guess, to say, we will see where the macro goes on commodities. But as we think about the back half and the price material implications, I would say, our forecast now include impacted price. So I think we feel good about that under the scenario that the backlog's cleaning itself out and we have the price increases in place. So I think that's good news for the back half. The -- well, I mean, to answer that question, the back half goes to a linear amortization amount at roughly $7 million a quarter. So if you are thinking about the second quarter, it's not as high as the first, because of the inventory rolls off into the second quarter, and we said it was 45 for the year, so you could do the math and squeeze the second quarter and that's as simple as I can make it. Go ahead. Sure. And I think the only thing I would add is the sequence of cash flow is more like it's been in years past, which is fourth quarter being our highest quarter of cash flow and we will progressively pace through the year where we will see free cash flow increase from Q2 into Q4. But, again, I think, as Rich said, we -- and we said in our prepared comments, the balance sheet will have some liquidation to it in the sense of we had very high receivables because of the high shipments in March coming off of a low January. So just time wise, the collection period falls into the second quarter and then you also have inventory which will continue, I think, to come down over the course of the year as we ship across the backlog. Hi. No. Not significantly, although CapEx is -- in our growth-oriented businesses, if you think about the ones we are talking about that have the higher growth profiles, that's where the CapEx is."

            "content": "Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. I am on slide three, it shows the detailed U.S. GAAP and adjusted quarterly results. So let's go to slide four and take a look at the performance highlights. Our results in the first quarter were in line with expectations, our expectations. The demand for products and service continue to be robust across the portfolio and the management teams of our operating companies did a solid job of navigating various challenges during the quarter. Going into the quarter, we had appropriately forecasted the supply chain and input inflation headwinds, but we did not forecast significant geopolitical destabilization nor the return of pandemic challenges in China, which negatively impacted some businesses in our portfolio from a demand and supply chain perspective. We were able to largely offset these unexpected headwinds through robust production performance, particularly late in the quarter on the back of our backlog strength. Let's move to the next slide. Organic revenue was up 9% year-over-year in the quarter on strong demand across the majority of the portfolio. Backlogs remain at record levels up 54% year-over-year and 5% sequentially with book-to-bill above 1 in all five segments. Operating margin performance in the quarter was below our expectation. Planned volume leverage productivity and tight cost controls were able to dampen the forecasted negative impact of supply chain constraints and negative price costs embedded in older backlogs -- in older orders and the backlogs of certain businesses. But our actions were short of fully offsetting unscheduled production interruptions caused by supply chain constraints and severe weather events, which negatively impacted volume and cost absorption and had an unfavorable mix effect on margins. We expect this to be recovered over the balance of the year. During the quarter we continued to invest organically in capacity expansions and productivity initiatives to drive revenue growth and operational success. We recently acquired a unique intellectual property portfolio used in electric powered and hybrid waste collection vehicles, which we plan to showcase a fully electric refuse vehicle built for one of our municipal customers at WasteExpo in May. Our first quarter performance demonstrated again the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses and our commitment to continuous improvement in operational rigor. Due to the dynamic environment in which we are operating, quarter-to-quarter results will be noisy, which I am sure we will discus at length during the Q&A. But keep in mind that we have a robust backlog and that the businesses that face challenges in the back half of 2021 are positioned to drive robust performance as we get through the tougher comps of the first half of 2022. Despite the macro headwinds, we are well-positioned to deliver our full year revenue guidance of 7% to 9% organic growth and adjusted EPS of $8.45 per share to $8.65 per share. Let's go to slide five. Engineered Products revenue was up 15% organically in the quarter. Demand continues to be robust across much of the portfolio and we have considerable visibility as a result of backlog -- a robust backlog position. Comparable operating margin was down largely as a result of price cost and supply chain challenges, but sequentially improved, as production performance ramped up and older backlog shipped. We expect this dynamic to continue through the balance of the year. Clean Energy & Fueling was flat organically as the expected roll-off of EMA -- EMV demand in North America retail fueling was offset by growth in other businesses. Demand was strong across the balance of the portfolio of businesses with particular strength in Clean Energy components, vehicle wash, below-ground and fueling components. Let me unpack the margin performance here before we make this an EMV-only story and draw the wrong conclusions of the projected margin trajectory for the balance of the year. As we previewed last quarter, we incurred roughly $20 million in new acquisition related depreciation and amortization in the quarter driven by our Clean Energy acquisitions in late 2021. This represented a 400-basis-point headwind to segment margins in the quarter. The balance of the margin dilution is a result of product mix, which is EMV driven and Q1 supply chain and production challenges. Unfortunately, we lost a week of production in March due to weather event at one of our main production facilities in Texas. Setting aside acquisition accounting, we expect the segment to deliver robust absolute revenue and profits for the full year. Sales in Imaging & ID declined 1% organically as volumes in our core marketing and coding business were constrained by component shortages, as well as China lockdowns and reduction of business in Russia, more than offset growth in our serialization and brand management software businesses. Digital textile printing continued its gradual recovery. Q1 margins in Imaging & ID were down to lower volumes and higher input costs. Pumps & Process Solution posted another strong quarter at 13% organic growth. We saw strong volumes across all businesses and geographies. Demand remained strong in core biopharma activity where drug R&D projects, which that were sidelined during COVID, came back strongly. But we did see normalization in order rates for COVID driven biopharma components as demand for COVID-19 vaccines and therapies moderate. Margin performance was solid in the quarter on strong volumes, fixed cost absorption and favorable mix in pricing. Topline results in Climate & Sustainability Technologies continued to be robust, posting 17% organic growth and strength across all businesses in major geographies. Margins were up in the quarter as robust volumes, solid operating performance and improved price costs offset cost inflation and input shortages. I will pass it on to Brad from here. Okay. I am on slide nine. This slide includes our current view of demand outlook, operational environment and margin drivers for the remainder of 2022 by segment [ph]. We expect topline in Engineered Products to remain robust, based on solid backlogs and sustained strong bookings. Vehicle services continues to ship against a record high demand, driven by new vehicle service facility builds, replacement of service equipment, growth in wheel aligners, as well as share gains. Orders for refuse trucks and software solutions are robust, with new order rates pushing well into the second half of the year. Momentum in industrial automation remains strong, particularly in China and within automotive, industrial winches continue to recovery with notable strength in natural resources and energy, and aerospace and defense will remain muted in Q2 on order timing but should accelerate in the second half. As expected, price cost was negative in the first quarter in this segment, but we expect it to flip positive in the second quarter as several rounds of price increases cycle through backlogs. We have also introduced other mechanisms to dampen the impact of margin cost volatility in our Capital Equipment businesses. All-in, we expect margins to improve sequentially as the year progresses. We expect Clean Energy & Fueling to post robust growth for the full year as solid growth in below-ground, fuel transport, vehicle wash and software solutions, coupled with our acquisitions in Clean Energy and components, which are off to a strong start, should more than offset the roll off of EMV demand. Excluding the $45 million of incremental deal-related amortization expenses in 2022, of which approximately $20 million were incurred in Q1, we expect full year margins to improve on volume and mix. Demand conditions in Imaging & ID are expected to remain solid as component shortages in core marketing and coding subside. Serialization and brand protection software should contribute positively to robust bookings and backlog. Digital textile printing is recovering. We expect margin in this segment to be stable. Order trends in Pumps & Process Solutions remained robust for much of the segment. Activity industrial pumps and polymer processing is solid and precision components continues its upward trajectory aided by increasing activity at refineries and petrochemical plants, and a recent uptick in orders for OEM gas compressor new builds. Our biopharma business remains strong, but likely lumpy intra-year from a demand perspective as our customers transition from COVID MNRA vaccine production to alternative therapies. Subject to year-to-year shifts in mix, we expect 30%-plus margin in this segment as the new normal going forward. We expect Climate & Sustainability Technologies to post double-digit organic growth this year driven by its large backlog in sustained order rates. New orders in core food, retail businesses have been healthy across product segments. Our case business within food retail is now booking into 2023. Our heat exchanger businesses positioned well on strong order rates across all geographies and end markets. And Belvac packaging equipment business continues to work through its record backlog. They are also booked for 2022 and are taking orders for 2023. Q2 and Q3 are seasonally strongest quarters for volumes and margins in the segment. We expect margins to improve significantly in 2022 on improved volume leverage, positive price cost dynamics and normalizing sequential. Okay. Here we go. This is the new slide and I am going to attempt to provide some clarity on bookings and backlog by segment, since this subject has been actively debated and I can see it continues to be this morning. First, total backlog is up 50% year-over-year with double-digit growth across all segments despite robust revenue performance in the last 12 months. All segments also posted sequential growth in backlog during Q1. Next, our book-to-bill in Q1 was 1.1, with all five segments above 1 despite 9% organic growth in the quarter. This is a very good picture. Topline visibility is a great thing from an operational and planning perspective, and it's an important pillar of our full year guidance. Intuitively, we would not expect these elevated order rates and advanced ordering patterns to persist, especially in the short cycle portion of our portfolio, as supply chains improve. But we see two factors influencing current order patterns. First, it's reasonable to assume that customers who expect persistent inflation will continue advance ordering to lock in favor -- in the attempt of locking favorable pricing. And second, customers expecting robust demand in 2023, while remain cautious on supply chain stability, want to ensure supply. As you can imagine, we spend a lot of time on this topic, and at present, do not have a conclusive view despite booking into 2023 in long cycle CapEx driven portions of the portfolio. So we will just have to adapt accordingly and keep a keen eye on working capital as the year progresses. I would however caution that we need to be careful about drawing definitive conclusions on changes in comparative order rates or backlogs. The scale of our typical operating company gives us significant flexibility to adapt the changes in the demand environment and we manage them all uniquely based on the operating model, business cycle and competitive stack. I am absolutely confident that we have the tools to maximize profitability to the upside scenario and to protect it on the downside as we approved in 2020 and 2021. Dover's portfolio has significant diversification from a product and end market exposure perspective, many of which we believe has secular growth tailwinds, and as such, despite the ongoing macro and geopolitical challenges at present, we are continuing to invest organically behind areas of strength. Moving to slide 11, again, we are reaffirming full year guidance for the year. And let's move on to Q&A. Hi, Jeff. Sure. Jeff, I mean, we were chasing price costs last year, and one of the good things that, I mean, the good news is having a high backlog, you get visibility, which is helpful to planning, let's say. The bad news is if that backlog is building in advance of input cost headwinds, you are chasing it to a certain extent. So, as you are basically -- without replacing backlog, right? You go negative price costs, which we saw in Q4 last year. If you remember what we talked about, at the end of the year, I said, the disappointing performance for us in Q4 was, because of supply chain, we did not convert as much backlog as we would have liked, which would have strangely, our revenue would have been up and our margin would have been down in Q4. And what we have done is we have carried some of that into Q1, and I think, if you remember, what we said about modeling Q1 this year was that it was a safe bet to model it against Q4 of last year, and if you go do the comparisons, we are pretty much spot on. But we are shipping that older backlog, right? So now we had so we are going to squeeze price costs in Q2 significantly and then flip significantly positive, at least in three portions of the portfolio on the back half of the year and particular in Engineered Products, in Clean Energy, and in Climate, where we expect to see a significant benefit in the back half of next year on price cost and because of the comps are significantly easier, right? I call your attention to our Q2 performance last year, I think, was the highest margin that Dover ever posted. So the comp that we have got ahead of us is a tough one. I would tell you that, I guess before somebody asks, again, I would point to Q2 last year as a proxy for performance of Q2 this year. Well, I think that how my top concerns point of view, this China COVID situation is new news in the quarter that we have had to navigate here. I don't have a view on where this goes. I am hoping, based on the news this morning that we are not going to move on to Guangzhou or somewhere else, but that is not helping from a supply chain point of view. Look, so far, the pricing that we have passed has not been to the detriment of backlog. So we haven't had call offs in that backlog. I think the biggest issue for us is the supply chain side of the business. Does it get better or does it get worse from here? We will see. And from our customers' point of view, they again are dealing with supply chain issues and labor availability issues. So that's where you have got a lot of push and pull of, we are working really hard to get the product out the door and we are working really hard with our customers to make sure they are ready to receive at the same time, because they are dealing with their own call them supply chain issues. So right now we don't see it. We don't see much of a risk in terms of shipping our backlog other than our own constraints and so as far as the customer taking it, but we will see going from here. Thanks. Hi, Andy. Yeah. Think that we are going to go through a little bit of an air pocket here in terms of the demand function because of this transition from COVID therapies to non-COVID therapies. I think, on the long run, we believe that this is a growth market and I'd like to thank Danaher for going before us, because I think, they explained it far better than we are going to be able to do it. But we expect in the middle of this year to have reduction in order rates as that transition takes place, that's accommodated into our earnings forecast for the year. But I don't believe that this is -- this COVID-related issue is an air pocket where revenues are going to drop never to be seen again. We think it's an intra-year conversion and we feel really good about our position in single use. The two-year CAGR on Belvac is now in the 40s. The two-year CAGR on heat exchangers is in the 20s. So it's not -- before we get to refrigeration. So you have got two big principal drivers, which are margin accretive to the segment, by the way. The two-year CAGR on refrigeration business is about 16.5, 17, and it's widespread across the portfolio, the fastest growing portion being the systems business. As we have discussed before, we will take all the system business we could get and we are trying to maximize the profitability on the case business. Meaning that we are trying to -- we are not running and taking all the business that's out there. So, so far, so good, still a lot of supply chain issues, because these are complicated assembly processes, but Q2 and Q3 margins should be interesting. Good morning. Yeah. Look, I mean, I think, you can calculate that, right? If I say it's going to look similar at the end of the day. I don't have that at the top of my head. I know that from a data point, but I'd have to go ask one of my colleagues here about trying to extrapolate that into organic growth. I can tell you it should be similar to Q1. Right. Well, the back half of the year, the incrementals are going be significant, because the comps with all the operational difficulties that we had last year, I mean, we lap all that. We are shutting down facilities and we had negative absorption. We had reduced volumes, negative absorption, everything else, and the beginnings of negative price costs. So if all things being equal, and the supply chain and the macro doesn't get worse from here, yeah, I mean our incrementals in the back half of the year, particularly in Engineered Products and in Clean Energy and in Climate should be robust? Yeah. Well, I mean, clearly, it's going to be that headwind plus. So you mop up all the headwind on a comp basis, plus you get normalized incremental margin on the volume. I never told you. So there's nothing to remind you there. All right. Hi, Scott. Oh, boy. Well, like I tried to say before, we listen to Danaher, because we knew this was coming and I think that what they articulated was far better as -- we are a subcomponent supplier. What I will tell you is that, skid production in biopharma is very much a growth avenue, right? It grew because of COVID. But now these mRNA therapies have got a variety of different therapeutic uses and the chosen technology for production and our understanding is skid, and as such, we are component supplier to that chosen type of production. I don't know. Maybe you and I can go down to WasteExpo on May 5th and go take a look at it. Look, we are not... I will meet you there. Yeah. We don't have a plane here, so I can't pick you up. Nonetheless... ... remember, we are not a chassis builder. So this is... ... a basically if you think about a hybrid, this is a battery pack that drives the compactor that sits on the back of the truck. So the use is, in theory, a full electric vehicle. So you have a full electric truck with this technology sitting on the back, but you could also have a diesel chassis with an electric -- so with an electric compactor, the guys that run this business are going to hate me for trying to describe it and you get basically a hybrid benefit. So are we going to make money on it? That's the intent. But the fact of the matter is, for municipalities, its taxpayer money at work here and if somebody decides they want to go to an electric fleet, they are going to go to an electric fleet, and as a material supplier, we have got to have a product offering. Thanks. Hi, Joe. Yeah. Look, I mean, I know, we have all these discussions about price cost and what's ignored there is the dilutive effect on price cost. Even at neutrality, it's dilutive to margins. So you are going to get that piece of it even if we were absolutely neutral across the entire portfolio and pricing has been robust. That's the math. That's the way the math works at the end of the day. Now, our portfolio is so diverse. It's a little bit all over the place and depending on how much commodity exposure we have in certain businesses and everything else. From an absolute profit point of view, I think, because Q2 was peak margins for -- I am going to get my years right now, 2021. Even with that dilutive effect and absolute profit, Q2 is a proxy. But I'd be careful about the margin. Yeah. I am going to leave the AD&A questions to my colleagues. I will deal with everything else and we can circle back on the linearity. Okay. We will endeavor to remove AD&A from the segments going forward, our bad on that one. Nonetheless, look, Q1 was just a mess. I don't want to go back and revisit COVID. But in January, at our main production facilities, we weren't doing much. We rushed like hell to pump out as much as we could and we were actually at a pretty good pace, and then we lost a week of production in our main production facility above-ground dispensers in March because of hurricane. That's life. It should have happened in the quarter where we weren't taking $20 million of AD&A I guess. And our Clean Energy business, which no one understood and -- understandably no one understands the seasonality. Their actual lowest profit margin of the year is Q1, where we basically write orders for the balance of the year. So the backlog that we can see and the revenue trajectory that we can see for those business is very good, but is actually dilutive to prior year margins because of seasonality. So, from here, supply -- all things supply chain being equal, our below-ground business, which is very profitable is booked and our Clean Energy is all coming and that's accretive to margins and that is doing very well from a backlog point of view. So as long as we can get the product out the door, I am confident that full year absolute profit and margins performance will be robust despite EMV. Thanks. Hi. Thanks. Yeah. I think that one could say that pricing that you have seen in Q1 remains linear over the balance of the year and the margin accretion in the second half is, because you flip positive because of inventory valuation, so, if you follow me. Meaning that... ...pricing is in. As we cycle the older inventory that is valued higher, you have got -- in Q4 and Q1 it was dilutive. It gets to neutrality, slightly positive and then it flips all things, assuming we get all the product out the door positive from there. So the growth rate for the full year, one could assume is somewhere in the 5% to 6% price-related and the balance being volume. But as you know, mix here, because of the diversity of the portfolio is going be quite different likely. Yeah. I mean, the economic environment in Europe is a risk. But we can only look, the good news is that our backlogs in Europe are not as high as they are in North America, but they still remain good and our expectation is that we would ship off that, but clearly, we are going to watch order rates in Europe from here, if one adopts a scenario of the demand function in Europe getting worse from here. Look, Andrew, I mean, we could think of 100 different reasons to kind of tap down expectations for this year, whether that be, what's going to happen with COVID in Asia. What's going to happen with Russia, Ukraine in Europe? We are not assuming continued strength in the dollar versus some of our other trading currencies. But I think that would be a copout and it's too early to tell here. The good -- we are looking -- the challenge for us is to get the product shipped profitably from here. And that is up to us in the productivity side and it's up to us to work the supply chain things like crazy. But as I said in my prepared comments, we do this business-by-business and we are on it, right, in terms of tearing apart order rates and making sure that we don't get over our skis from a working capital perspective or anything else and we will see how it goes. Right now, we believe that we can meet our forecast for the year. Thanks. Well, I will take the last one first. I think that we said that margins are going be stable on the full year. Look, we did have circuit board shortages in Q1, bad on us. And that was partially due by the fact that we sourced those from Asia, so the Asia lockdowns and we had to shut our production factory in Shanghai -- which is in Shanghai during the quarter. So we will pick up as much as we can out of there. To a certain extent, the geographical mix on that business is more levered towards consumer production in Europe. So we are being a bit cautious in the demand function, and, again, I don't want to bring up this translation issue again, but that's part of it also. So, overall, I mean, this is a business that grows low-to-mid single digits at pretty much constant margins, although I will give the management team a lot of credit, over the last couple years, they have driven margins up nicely, our expectation for this year, probably that kind of performance, low single-digit growth at healthy margins and excellent cash flow. But it's going be a little choppy base on macro and supply chain. Okay. You want me to take it first? Yeah. All right. As a portfolio comment, we do not believe that our inventories are reflective of our distribution network inventories. Meaning pretty much what we ship out the door kind of passes through distribution. Our inventories are high, clearly, but so is our backlog, right? So the way that we look at those inventories is. Before -- I am just talking about physical inventory before we get into working capital, that's something else. But to the extent that we ship that backlog, which we have every intention of doing that those inventories will moderate. And you also need to take into account that inflation has an impact on absolute dollar value of inventories, right? So it's very nice that everybody's talking about raising prices and everything else. But that needs to be taken into account when you look at year-over-year change in inventory because the absolute value of that inventory has gone up significantly. Thanks. Good morning. Yeah. You should hear the yelling and screaming that goes on about pricing sometimes around here. Yeah. I don't think so. I think that any pricing from here, especially in the capital goods side, is going be surcharge and not absolute price. But we will see. I mean, if you tell me what the trajectory of inflation's going be over the balance of the year. I mean, that's one of the watch points. I mean, I think, what good news, bad news on inflation, is the way that we look at it, is inflation looks to be moderating, except the fact that we have got a trillion plus of infrastructure and American Rescue Plan coming our way. And what does that mean? It's hard to say right now. I think, the good news is, does that -- is that good from the demand point of view in certain business like ours? Yes, it is, right, because it's where we have got a big portion of our portfolio that's tied to CapEx. What does that mean from an inflation point of view? All bets are off there. So it's an interesting dynamic. I don't, so I guess to answer your question is, I think that we are going to be very selective from here and if it's commodity price driven, it's likely to be surcharge based. Well, I mean, look, that was in, perhaps, DPPS, like, biopharma demand is probably intra-year going to be a bit light. So I think that nobody should fall out of their chairs if order rates go down there some. The balance of that portfolio is actually order rates are picking up quite nicely. Now that's slightly dilutive to biopharma, but not to the extent where people saying that we are over earning and we are going to go back to historical margins. So I think if you go back and take a look at transcript, I'd say that, 30% plus is the new normal here. So we will be able to absorb it. Where we are looking and I will -- where we are looking for and it should make sense when you go back and take a look at the calendarization of earnings last year, where we are looking for absolute profit performance, 2022 versus 2021 is in Engineered Products, Clean Energy and into the Climate side of the business. We are not looking for a lot of year-over-year incremental profit from the other two segments. There's going be some, but that's not going to be the principle driver, because, quite frankly, those two businesses more or less sailed through 2021. Thanks. Oh! For the segment? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you are talking about. Go. Well, you answered the question. Yes, there is seasonality in the acquired businesses. Q1 is actually the lowest margin quarter. So supply chain and COVID issues aside in Q1, the -- what we expect is we rollout of EMV demand in Q2, which is probably the peak for EMV demand for last year, which is margin accretive, but we basically offset that over the balance of the year and then some through the acquired revenue and profits and the fact that our underground business and vehicle wash and everything else start shipping significantly through the year and that's against a comp in the second half of last year where it was weak. Thanks."

If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir.\nJack Dickens: Thank you, Angela. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through February 22, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Jack. Let's start with the key messages on Slide 3. Market demand conditions in the fourth quarter played out largely as we expected. And as we discussed at the end of Q3, we adopted a business posture focused on managing down production in certain product lines to balance channel inventories to the detriment of fixed cost absorption. This puts us in a good inventory position and enable us to match demand and production in 2024. This operating posture also drove solid operating free cash flow performance in the quarter, which positions us to play offense on the capital deployment front in 2024. We capitalized on strong volumes in several markets and drove margin mix higher for the consolidated portfolio in the quarter. The breadth and diversity of our end market exposures, along with proactive cost containment and pricing discipline led to another record high quarterly segment margin in Q4. We remained active on the portfolio front. We improved our portfolio through synergistic bolt-on acquisitions, including two transactions announced in January that add attractive reoccurring and software revenue streams with good growth exposures to our mix. We expect to close the DESTACO sale by the end of the first quarter, which will further enhance our cash position. We entered 2024 in a significantly better financial position than we were 12 months ago. Underlying demand across the majority of the portfolio is solid. Bookings momentum is improving, and we drove the first organic bookings growth in eight quarters. Of note, biopharma book-to-bill was above one, signifying an improving sentiment in the market which is also evident in the recently announced results of some customers and channel partners. While we expect seasonality in idiosyncratic headwinds such as European heat pumps and can-making equipment to weigh on volumes in the first half. Overall, we expect demand conditions to progressively improve off the fourth quarter exit rate through the year. Our recent investments puts us in a very strong position to capture secular growth across numerous end markets like CO2 refrigeration, bioprocessing, data center cooling, electricification of heating and cooling and smart compressor controls. In-flight cost actions provide carryover benefits in 2024 with specific projects to be announced during the year. Lastly, our balance sheet has ample capacity to execute against a strong acquisition pipeline and pursue opportunistic capital return strategies as we continue to upgrade the portfolio over time. Let's go to Slide 4. Consolidated organic revenue was down 3% in the quarter. Bookings were up 2% organically, reflecting growing order rate momentum across much of the portfolio. Segment margin was up 100 basis points to 22% on broad-based productivity and port portfolio improvements. Free cash flow in the quarter was over $450 million or 22% of revenue on improved working capital efficiency and lower CapEx. Adjusted EPS was up 13% to $2.45 per share in the quarter. Our guide for 2024 reflects a constructive outlook. We are guiding for organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $8.95 to $9.15 [ph] per share, which represents a 5% to 7% year-over-year organic growth, excluding the tax reorganization benefit recognized in the fourth. Let's skip to Slide 5. Engineered Products had a solid quarter driven particularly strong volume growth in conversion and waste handling. Chassis availability improved in the quarter and the business has reservations from large national waste haulers and municipalities well into 2024. Europe and Asia shipments were notably lower in vehicle aftermarket, but bookings improved during the quarter. Margin performance improved 270 basis points on positive mix benefits and volume conversion on recent productivity investments in the waste-hauling business, coupled with a solid performance in Aerospace and Defense. Clean Energy and fueling is our most distribution leverage segment, and as such, is where we intervened aggressively on production to facilitate general channel destocking in below-ground retail fueling, hanging hardware, LPG components and car wash in the quarter. Cryogenic components continued their robust growth and above-ground fueling equipment was up on continued recovery in U.S. dispensers. We believe that our proactive intervention on production in Q4 has allowed excess channel inventory to clear and we expect this business in this segment to return to normal booking and shipping posture in 2024 with normal seasonality levered to quarters 2 and 3. Imaging & ID posted another as projected stable quarter against a difficult comparable period with a high degree of reoccurring revenue, end market and geographic diversity and exposures to growing regulatory requirements for product ID and traceability. This segment remains a consistent performer with strong margins and cash flows. Margin performance in the quarter was exemplary. Pumps & Process Solutions was up organically in the quarter on strong shipments in polymer processing and precision components. The integration of FW Murphy is off to a strong start with a good reception from our customers and notable recent wins of substantial reoccurring revenue contracts in remote monitoring and smart compressor technology. Top line performance and climate and sustainability technologies was impacted by expected volume declines in beverage can making and as well as the recent and abrupt industry slowing in the broader HVAC complex in Europe and Asia, most notably in residential heat pumps, demand - the degree of which was not incorporated in our previous forecast. Margin performance was exceptional in the quarter, driven by improvement in food retail, which posted EBIT margins in excess of 15% in the fourth quarter, traditionally a seasonally slower quarter on positive CO2 product mix and productivity. The food retail team deserves accommodation for their operational achievements to drive significant margin accretion in these past 3 years, but we still have further runway to improve largely on improved product mix. I'll pass it on to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Okay. Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 7. The top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 3%, with acquisitions and FX translation contributed positive 1% to the top line in the quarter. FX resulted in a $0.01 tailwind in the fourth quarter but remained a $0.06 headwind for the full year, primarily driven by inter-year movements in the euro-dollar exchange rate. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was up 2% in the quarter, while Europe was down 16% on lower shipments in retail fueling and HVAC components. All of Asia was up 5%. China, which represents about half of our revenue base in Asia, was up 14% organically in the quarter, driven by large order timing within polymer processing. On the bottom chart, bookings were up year-over-year due to normalization of lead times. Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with our full year free cash flow generation, which came in at $1.1 billion, nearly double the prior year's level on working capital management and lower CapEx. On the working capital front, as previously discussed, we actively work to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023 with a particular focus on inventory reduction in the back half of the year. We believe we have further room to go on working capital improvement in 2024. 2023 CapEx came in lower after reaching a record level of investment in 2022. The step down in CapEx in '23 was less pronounced due to a onetime $14 million opportunistic purchase of real estate within our Heat Exchanger business during 2023. We expect CapEx to further step down into '24. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. I'm on Slide 9. This highlights the results of some recent investments behind several fast-growing platforms and portfolio. A few years ago, these were nascent product lines with about $50 million in combined revenue. We saw a significant growth opportunity in these markets and proactively organically invested in CapEx and R&D to cultivate technological leadership and provide a sufficient foundation for these businesses to win and scale with customers. We are in the early innings of capitalizing on these investments and are excited about their long-term prospects. Across these markets, we enjoy leadership positions with recognized technology and strong relationships with marquee customers. With about $200 million in combined revenue planned for this year and a double-digit long-term growth trajectory, we expect these platforms to become meaningful contributors to Dover's overall growth profile. Slide 10 shows progress against our capital deployment priorities. After several years of elevated capital investments into capacity, productivity and automation projects, we expect capital expenditures to be lower in 2024. We continue seeking high confidence, high return on investment, organic investments, and we'll prioritize those in our capital allocation decisions. Acquisitions remain part and parcel to building a better and stronger Dover. We have been actively shaping our portfolio in line with these priorities and we indicated to investors pulled through at - through additions and subtractions as we work to reshape and enhance the portfolio towards higher growth, higher return and lower cyclicality. Our cash flow position and capital allocation optionality are far superior compared to term [ph] last year. We expect another year of solid free cash flow generation in '24, with the added benefit of sale proceeds from DESTACO should close at the end of February, the beginning of March. We have ample balance sheet capacity to continue improving our portfolio through accretive acquisitions. We're opportunistically return capital to our shareholders. Moving to Slide 11 shows the long-term financial performance of the portfolio. Despite the top line headwinds we experienced in '20 and '23 over the past 5 years, we have grown organic revenue at a 4% annualized rate ahead of GDP and industrial averages. Our margin performance over that period was solid, up 410 basis points in aggregate at a conversion margin in excess of our long-term targets we laid out and primarily driven by operational improvement and product mix. Finally, let's go to Slide 12. Our top line growth in 2024 will be driven by our secular growth exposed end markets, including CO2, data center cooling, heating, electrification and cryogenic components. The near-term outlook for precision components remain strong as demand for infrastructure investment tied to the energy transition is driving increased demand for our compressor components and engineered bearings. Our waste handling business is effectively booked for the year and to continue its double-digit growth trajectory as chassis shortage abates and haulers work to publish - replenish and upgrade their fleets. Based on recent history, we have incorporated appropriate caution in our forecast for biopharma during the year, but we are confident that we will post year-on-year growth in this end market, and we'll update our view as the year progresses. Full year consolidated operating margin is forecasted to improve on volume, product mix and productivity actions. We have done the hard work to get our channel inventories and balance and expect revenue to build off the fourth quarter exit rate with a return to pre-COVID seasonality in several businesses. Our portfolio consists of a collection of businesses that operate in attractive and unique - niche end markets. Our business model is flexible, and we can quickly respond in changes in market dynamics, be the beneficial or detrimental to the business. We have numerous cost control levels and capital allocation optionality at our disposal to deliver on our full year forecast. I'd like to thank our global teams for the efforts to deliver last year's results, and we look forward to serving our customers, partners and investors in the year and ahead. And Jack, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin : Good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question. Bookings have turned positive, I think, first time in eight quarters. How sustainable is this churn? And how much visibility do you have in bookings staying positive?\nRichard Tobin : I would expect the bookings stays positive throughout '24 based on our outlook right now. I think that the channel - we've done the hard work on the channel inventory, and that's where we're seeing the inflection in the bookings, whether it be biopharma and that we would expect to see the same in Fueling Solutions. So I don't expect this trend - I don't expect to go negative unless we're going to have an unforeseen recession in 2024.\nAndrew Obin: That sounds good. And then just a question on biopharma. Do you - just to clarify, do you have any biopharma recovery in the year? Because my understanding is that some of the inventory will become obsolete sometime in the first half of the year. So what is reflected in your guidance and what's not? And I know that it's been tough to call for the past 12 months. So clearly, some degree of caution is warranted.\nRichard Tobin : It's not a coincidence that we did this call behind some of our customers because we had been in front of them and been wrong. We have very little accretion in earnings on biopharma despite the fact that order rates are beginning to pick up, we'd rather position ourself cautiously. And if you go back and look at the transcript, it said we were just going to update you where we are quarter-by-quarter. So I think that we're going to wait and see what we can say as we do not expect it to be down year-over-year, but we have not incorporated anything - any meaningful amount of operating profit up year-over-year. We'll keep that to ourselves until we see the orders.\nAndrew Obin: And am I correct in thinking that some of the inventory does become obsolete because it's FDA regulated?\nRichard Tobin : Yeah. You are absolutely correct.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi Group.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin : Hi, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Richard, Brad, maybe you could give us some more color on how you're thinking about the 1% to 2% organic growth by segment? And then how are you thinking about the cadence of growth in EPS for the year? I know you said you would return to pre-COVID seasonality rich [ph] in a lot of your businesses. But is this year going to be more back-end loaded given the turn in short cycle is happening kind of now?\nRichard Tobin : I think that it will start slowly. So I think the Q1 will be kind of a roll forward of what we saw in Q4 to a certain extent. But again, you've got some difficult comps. I would expect by Q2 - the vast majority of accretion will occur in Q2s and Q3 as we ramp production into that. And then Q4 - Q4 was actually pretty strong for us. Usually, it's a run for working capital. But again, like every other year, it's going to be highly dependent on production rates that we adopt for Q4.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Got it. That's helpful. And then that you mentioned the intervening in clean energy and that you feel good about where your inventory is now, would you say you generally feel that way across the Dover portfolio? Maybe Heat Pumps is an exception or Heat Exchanges for you guys? And then back to Clean Energy, do you see good demand in that business? Or is it more easier comparisons that should drive it in '24?\nRichard Tobin : Well, there's a lot of moving parts of what's in Clean Energy. I'd - to back up for a moment. I think that the operating posture that we adopted at-- as we move through Q3 into Q4, was predicated upon of dropping production to flush total channel inventory. And I think that we've accomplished that across the total portfolio. As you mentioned, I think what was not incorporated into our Q4 forecast was the sudden decline in demand on Heat Exchanges for Heat Pumps. Again, like biopharma, I think that we're going to be very cautious about that for '24 until we see the market return. So right now, I think that we're calling Heat Pumps down year-over-year, but I think that, that may prove to be conservative. I think that my own view is it's probably going to flush in Q1 and Q2, and then we'll return to growth on the other side. So overall, outside of Heat Exchangers for Heat Pumps, I think that we're in pretty good shape in terms of balance. And so what's incorporated into the 1 to 3 is basically that's the aggregate of demand that we see. So production demand should be pretty much in balance. So we will probably build some inventory in Q1 as we ramp back up for Q2 and Q3, but that's kind of the way we see it right now.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Can you grow DCST with Heat Exchangers down, Rich in '24?\nRichard Tobin : No, right? Because you've got Belvac rolling down year-over-year, which we've expected for 3 years. If Heat Exchangers stays with our forecast, which is very conservative, the CO2 revenue growth will not offset that, but I think that we're being cautious until we see what happens and when we see what all our customers say about Heat Pump demand for 2024.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin : You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin : Hey, Scott.\nScott Davis: Hi. Thanks for being brief with your prepared remarks. I really wish everybody would get that memo. It's - it's helpful to get to the [indiscernible] point as I say and get to Q&A and let's all move on. But guys, a couple of things caught my eye. One, kind of the volatility geographically, China up 14%, Europe down 16%. And maybe if you could walk around the world a little bit for us for '24 and expecting a little bit more of a normalization there? Or maybe some puts and takes on some of the geographic moves. I'll just stop there and open it up...\nRichard Tobin : Sure. Yes. Look, look, I think that the China number is kind of - first of all, China as a percent of our revenue now is, I don't know, 7% or 8%, 6% now, okay, 6%. So that number on the law of small numbers, when we make a big shipment into China out of polymer processing, it swings the numbers. Now the base business that - the remaining base business that we have in China is a reflection of the Chinese economy. It's not great. But it flexed up because of that. Europe is really a couple of things. Well, first of all, the European economy is not great, but it's been exasperated in the quarter by the sudden shift down in demand in heat exchanges or heat pumps where we went from an operating posture of selling absolutely everything we could make to selling hardly anything in about mid-September. So I think there was a market-wide recognition that inventory got over their skis a little bit, so that needs to clear. So what was baked into our forecast next year is I don't think that we're overly optimistic on Chinese demand. I think the European demand in aggregate should improve year-over-year only because of the fact of that idiosyncratic headwind that we had. But the vast majority of the growth that we've got baked into our forecast is North America driven.\nScott Davis: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. So Rich, I think you started off - the last couple of quarters, you've made increasingly more kind of tonality, positive remarks on M&A. What - this may be hard to answer, but what does good look like? If '24 is a good year for M&A? Is it to some sort of a range of dollars that you'd like to put to work or some sort of a - something where you guys just have a goal line in mind or that we can start to think about? And that's...\nRichard Tobin : Well, I mean, look, yes, sure. No, I understand the question. Look, at the end of the day, the reason that we put the one slide together in terms of firepower, it was an odd dynamic coming out of COVID where earnings accretion was great, but there wasn't a lot of cash flow because it was all getting hung up in supply chain and inventory and everything else. So what we expected going into this year was this is the year we've got to generate a bunch of cash. Now we've had ample balance sheet capacity during that time period. So it's not like we haven't been doing M&A because we were waiting to build this cash position. But on the other hand, I think our ability for M&A and capital return is significantly better just on pure cash than it was 12 months ago. So you would expect us to be more active in the deployment. Now we've closed three acquisitions in the last, what, 5 months. We've got a decent pipeline of acquisitions that kind of look like that. Would we like to do something bigger? Sure. But we've got some return hurdles that - if we can't find something with those return hurdles, then we'll return the cash to shareholders. So that's the posture we always adopt. So it's not like we got to go find X amount of M&A every year. We need to find things that are attractive from a return point of view. And if we can't, it's coming back to our shareholder base.\nScott Davis: Fair enough. Best of luck this year, guys. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin : Thanks.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.\nMike Halloran: Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin : Hey, Mike.\nMike Halloran: Just tying everything up, when you think about the year and the idea that things get better through the year for you, how much of that is tied to comps in destocking being behind you versus a fundamental thought process that the underlying demand patterns improve across the numerous businesses you have?\nRichard Tobin : I don't think that we're getting over our skis in terms of demand. At the end of the day, we've got one to three in top line. Now taking to that one to three is we've got a small amount of dilution because we sold the DESTACO [ph] versus what we brought into the portfolio. I think from an earnings point of view, that neutralized itself, but not from a top line point of view, when I take a look at the math. We've got certain parts of the portfolio that have just done fantastically which would be can-making equipment and polymer processing equipment where are cycling down. So we've known about this coming [ph] and that's why we've been investing in a variety of other portions of the portfolio to cycle up and we're going to take a look that we had a couple of footfalls last year that we don't expect to repeat. So net-net, the underlying growth is higher than one, three because we're incorporating the headwind that we have on some of the cyclical portions of the portfolio, but it's not as if we're baking in this return on just overall GDP growth, I think that what's really baked into our growth is where we have invested. So like what we just try to highlight on that page. I mean, we've taken - we've got a significant amount of revenue growth on three platforms that really didn't exist in the group up until a year ago of any consequence. So the growth is a little bit better than the highlight figure just because of the headwinds we got on the cyclical ones. And it's largely driven on specific products and end market exposure rather than AG, the Fed's going to drop interest rates and GDP is going to expand.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes. I guess what I would add to that is, unlike like we've been pretty vocal about the fact that price was pretty significant to the top line over the last 2 years that I would say, while it's not a big set of numbers here because of the one to three guide, there is positive volume growth, except for the first quarter as we come down on this idiosyncratic issue that we're talking about. So I think it is a better setup for us this year than years past where you can actually now think about plant absorption, return to volume, not just price.\nMike Halloran: Helpful. It makes a lot of sense. And then when you think about the pumps business, the industrial pumps piece, maybe just talk about what you're seeing underneath to put on that side, trajectory, order trends, et cetera, and how you're thinking about that for the year?\nRichard Tobin : It's decent. It really - the industrial pump side never really had the kind of headwind in terms of stocking and destocking. And that's really high-value equipment. So it's more or less fundamental demand. I think there was some caution in the back half of '23 just because of the carryover of interest rates and everything else. I think what's baked into our forecast this year is some growth, but not anything extraordinary on the industrial side.\nBrad Cerepak: Right.\nMike Halloran: Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it\nRichard Tobin : Thanks. Yeah.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nRichard Tobin : Hi.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Where are you in the like standoff on price and volume? And what do you assume for price for the year?\nRichard Tobin : Price is about a point to a point and a half. And on volume, I think...\nBrad Cerepak: Roughly the same thing. So on 50-50...\nRichard Tobin : Yes. So a point to a point and a half, and so it's 50-50 on price volume. And I think that we've done the hard work because of what the argument of against price is inventory balances. And I think that the one way you can protect price is not get over your skis in terms of inventory. And I think based on what you see in our cash flow that we've done the hard work for a good setup there. So right now, all we need to do is toggle production with orders at this point.\nSteve Tusa: How much do you think that production take down in the quarter? Did that impact margins to a degree?\nRichard Tobin : Yes. I mean you can see it in clean energy for sure.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then lastly, just any kind of more specific color on total margins for the year, whether it's basis point improvement or a hard number for margins?\nRichard Tobin : How's up for an answer. I know it's so dependent on mix. We'd like to see a quarter or two before we want to put a hard number on it. But I think that by and large, we should mix up this year.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, one more for you. EPS seasonality too. How do you see that kind of feathering in over the course of the year? What do you expect in 1Q? And then how does that build?\nRichard Tobin : Right. I think that Q1 will be more of a reflection of Q4. So I don't get all worked up about the comp. And then we bought - we get the absorption because we ramp from there and then regular seasonality. The vast majority of the accretion in EPS should be Q2 and Q3. And by the time we get to the half year, we'll probably have a good idea of where we stand on Q4. But I think that we put it in all the caution that we can just in terms of the macro, right? This is - our fundamental forecast is basically what we think volume is going to be by vertical here that - so we think that we can hit these numbers. And if we get a better macro or we get biopharma or return on some amount of HVAC that we're ready to go, but we prefer - rather than trying to lead that like we have over the last couple of years and speaking to those end markets, it's more of a show me. It comes, we'll upgrade our forecasting.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes. And on those two businesses, specifically, we're talking about SWEP [ph] and CPC. When the volume does come, they do convert and the mix is up. So that's the good news.\nSteve Tusa: Thanks. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin : Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin : Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey. So Rich, a lot of discussion around your portfolio these days. Just curious what you'd like to share about the potential to unlock value by divesting some of the pieces of the portfolio? Any comments you'd like to share there would be great.\nRichard Tobin : I mean we're committed to managing the portfolio. I think we sold DESTACO, I think, at a pretty good price in 2023. We've just - we've closed three acquisitions over the last five months where I think are margin accretive and more growth-oriented assets. So I think we'll do the same thing. I think that bigger portfolio moves, you need balance sheet optionality. And I think that if you look at what the knock-on effect of the really good cash flow that we have this past year is our balance sheet optionality is in a really good place. So - which we can be more prosaic about what that means, but at least the building blocks that we need to continue to shape portfolio have improved year-over-year. Let me put it to you that way.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. That's helpful. And I missed some of the initial commentary around the guide. I know that there - organically, I think you guys talked about maybe 5% to 7% EPS growth. But just maybe kind of help me understand the low end, the high end, what kind of shapes both of those?\nRichard Tobin : Well, I mean, the headline figure at one to three, you need to take into account that we know where we have cyclical headwinds going forward, right? So we had banked significant profits out of polymer processing and can-making equipment that we knew this headwind was coming. So in that one to three, we're making all that up. We've got a bit of a headwind in terms of the disposal of DESTACO coming out, that the acquisitions, I think on a profit point of view, neutralizes it, but not from a top line point of view. And then I think that we've - unlike previous years where we've kind of led forecasting in terms of biopharma and HVAC components because those are battlegrounds. We've taken a very cautious stance on that, and we're going to wait to see how the market develops.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, good enough. Thanks, guys.\nRichard Tobin : Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin : Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, Rich, just back to capital deployment. If I think about what you've laid out in the guide here today, is there any prospective capital deployment on share repurchase or deleveraging or anything like that in the numbers?\nRichard Tobin : Some, right. Look, if you calculate the EPS accretion on a cautious top line that you'd come with an incremental margin that is pretty high, right? So at the end of the day, what's incorporated in there is a little bit of capital deployment, whether that be in M&A activity or share repurchase. The timing of which we'll let you know when it happens.\nJeff Sprague: And then on your Slide 10, right? I mean, you do have two segments that are net negative M&A. I mean, does this kind of inform where we're headed over time? There's gems [ph] in DCST, obviously, like CO2. But should we take that chart at face value on what you're - how you're thinking about reshaping the portfolio?\nRichard Tobin : Well, that chart actually foots to the chart that we put out in 2020 in terms of the hierarchy of capital allocation to a certain - well, I think the DPPS and DCEF kind of flipped, but that - because you can't control in terms of closing acquisitions. Yes, I mean, overall, yes. I mean if you think that engineered products outside of defense has been an organic issue for us for some time. And DCST, Belvac and SWEP are organic and I think in refrigeration, I think that what we've done with the total investment, that would be an organic play also. So yes, I think that the hierarchy there, they may flip around a little bit, but it's largely correct.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. And just on the - back on the orders, Rich, that strengthened process orders in the quarter. Was that all bio or did something else notably pick up in there?\nRichard Tobin : I think it's broad based, and I think it's more influenced by what do we call them, the thermal connectors.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nRichard Tobin : You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nRichard Tobin : Good morning.\nJulian Mitchell: Morning. Maybe I just wanted to start with the operating margins. So I realize you're not giving a sort of firm-wide number for this year or much segment color. So maybe trying to think about some of the firm-wide drivers of margin this year. So I think there's some positive volume leverage because those are up 1, 1.5 points. Price cost is broadly neutral. M&A and divestment seems maybe neutral, what you've announced so far. So I wondered if those three assumptions were right. And then mix, I guess, anything you'd characterize from all those moving parts sort of biopharma stable, heat pump down, polymer and can down, maybe fueling up, like in aggregate, is there much of a mix impact do you think on margins in your guide?\nRichard Tobin : Well, you touched on them all, Julian. Yes. I mean, look, we cut production in DCF to manage inventory. So that is not just the lost products that we sell. It's all - and we did it on the underground portion of the business, which is highly margin accretive. So we get that back and it's reflected in Q4, and it's reflected in the year-over-year. So we would expect as we balance production that returns. Engineered Products, really the bulk of the margin accretion in '23 was driven by ESG, but that was more or less back half and we expect a full year of that going into 2024. And if you recall, we had a little bit of a hiccup with an implementation of ERP and VSG last year, which we don't expect to reoccur again. So that's helpful. PII, what do we close at? 25% margins. That's great. So that's more a revenue issue for us. DPPS has had a biopharma headwind now for 2-plus years. What we're calling here it's no longer a headwind and whatever we get on the top side, which we're not baking in a lot right now or hardly anything is going to be accretive. And the DCST has got - right now in our forecast would be margin down on mix because Belvac, which we knew was going to come down and our cautious stance on heat pumps. If we're wrong about being cautious about heat pumps, then that will flex that will - the headwind will be less than we've got modeled into our forecast for the year.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And I just wanted to follow up when you were talking about sort of some of the quarterly earnings trends. So do we assume sort of Q1 earnings or EPS is flattish? And then as you said, you get into the meat of the earnings growth in Q2 and Q3?\nRichard Tobin : Yes, I'm not going to go - it's - Q1 will be more of a reflection of the carryforward of Q4. What we'll get is some amount of production ramp, but a lot of bad comps and then we accelerate right out of there.\nJulian Mitchell: That's great. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin : Welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. We've covered a lot of ground. And Rich, you clearly don't want to give too much cover on margins, but I just wanted to have another crack here. Clearly, margin leverage is a big driver of earnings this year. So maybe just talk about what you baked in for structural cost savings? I know we've got some roll forward from some of the actions you took in '23, but maybe just itemize any other significant cost actions you've taken driving margins in '24?\nRichard Tobin : Yes. If we go back and look at the transcript, Nigel, we do have carryforward from actions that we took in the back half of the year. We've got some coming. I'm not ready to calendarize it yet because they're not fully baked, but we do have a list of - we do have a list of cost actions, which are more of a revenue hedge. So if we take those actions and we're right on the demand profile, those should actually be accretive to us. So they're not necessarily baked in at this point. And the reason they're not baked in is because we're working on the timing in terms of the execution.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then on pricing, we've been very successful in pushing price. I mean, I think we've all been a little bit nervous about some of the more raw material sensitive businesses, SWEP, Hillphoenix and maybe parts of ESG as well. But it sounds like your customers are forecasting inflation on their components, specifically with the HVAC end market. So just curious what you're seeing in terms of pricing power across the portfolio in '24, specifically within some of these more raw material sensitive end markets?\nRichard Tobin : Yes, it's interesting. I mean, if you go back and look at our realized pricing, and I'm talking about the portion of the pricing that's fallen all the way to the bottom line, it has not been dramatic for us. And it's a source of consternation around here of what is capable in pricing. And so if we look at some of our end market customers and what they've passed through on pricing, I guess that we've been jealous for lack of better words. So to us, it's been - we've - I don't want to be negative. I think we've taken some price I don't feel that we've got a couple of businesses that have escalation, de-escalation clauses in terms of inputs. I think we've been on the front foot in those businesses of being proactive about locking in our pricing, especially going into this year. So right now, we've actually got a little bit of room if we had to give back pricing, but that's not my expectation. Our issue has always been that the way to defend pricing is not to get over your skis and inventory, and that's why we took it into the neck to a certain extent to kind of manage that position at the end of last year going into kind of the demand environment, at least the setup as we see it today, I think that we feel good about our ability to protect price.\nNigel Coe: Right, okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in.\nRichard Tobin : Thanks, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hey. Was there any comments puts or takes on how January started? And just a couple of minutes ago, the ISM January new orders came out at above 50 for the first time, I think, in like 1.5 years, so at 52.5. But any puts and takes from your perspective there?\nRichard Tobin : You know what, I don't know. So I would expect if it's been terrible, I would have heard something. Usually, when it's positive, no one tells me anything. But - so we haven't even closed the month yet, Deane. So - but I'm unaware of it being worse than what we have baked in.\nDeane Dray: All right. Good to hear. And then just a quick question. Data center cooling came up a couple of different times. Your heat exchangers play a key role there. Do you have a sense of how that is geared towards air cooling versus liquid cooling because there's a big investment cycle starting, I mean, it's more than 30% growth in liquid cooling side. Will you participate in that?\nRichard Tobin : It's almost exclusively levered towards liquid cooling.\nDeane Dray: Yes. And are you not tied to a particular vendor, you'll be - you're a component supplier for that. Is that correct?\nRichard Tobin : That's correct.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes. When we say thermal, we need liquid cooling in data centers.\nDeane Dray: That's great.\nRichard Tobin : Yeah. But we supply everybody.\nDeane Dray: Thank you...\nBrad Cerepak: It's not just heat exchangers, it's connectors, too.\nDeane Dray: Understood.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes.\nRichard Tobin : Got it?\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 7. The top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 3%, with acquisitions and FX translation contributed positive 1% to the top line in the quarter. FX resulted in a $0.01 tailwind in the fourth quarter but remained a $0.06 headwind for the full year, primarily driven by inter-year movements in the euro-dollar exchange rate. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was up 2% in the quarter, while Europe was down 16% on lower shipments in retail fueling and HVAC components. All of Asia was up 5%. China, which represents about half of our revenue base in Asia, was up 14% organically in the quarter, driven by large order timing within polymer processing. On the bottom chart, bookings were up year-over-year due to normalization of lead times. Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with our full year free cash flow generation, which came in at $1.1 billion, nearly double the prior year's level on working capital management and lower CapEx. On the working capital front, as previously discussed, we actively work to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023 with a particular focus on inventory reduction in the back half of the year. We believe we have further room to go on working capital improvement in 2024. 2023 CapEx came in lower after reaching a record level of investment in 2022. The step down in CapEx in '23 was less pronounced due to a onetime $14 million opportunistic purchase of real estate within our Heat Exchanger business during 2023. We expect CapEx to further step down into '24. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Hi, Andrew. Thanks. Yes. I guess what I would add to that is, unlike like we've been pretty vocal about the fact that price was pretty significant to the top line over the last 2 years that I would say, while it's not a big set of numbers here because of the one to three guide, there is positive volume growth, except for the first quarter as we come down on this idiosyncratic issue that we're talking about. So I think it is a better setup for us this year than years past where you can actually now think about plant absorption, return to volume, not just price. Right. Hi, Steve. Roughly the same thing. So on 50-50... Yes. And on those two businesses, specifically, we're talking about SWEP [ph] and CPC. When the volume does come, they do convert and the mix is up. So that's the good news. Yes. When we say thermal, we need liquid cooling in data centers. It's not just heat exchangers, it's connectors, too. Yes."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack. Let's start with the key messages on Slide 3. Market demand conditions in the fourth quarter played out largely as we expected. And as we discussed at the end of Q3, we adopted a business posture focused on managing down production in certain product lines to balance channel inventories to the detriment of fixed cost absorption. This puts us in a good inventory position and enable us to match demand and production in 2024. This operating posture also drove solid operating free cash flow performance in the quarter, which positions us to play offense on the capital deployment front in 2024. We capitalized on strong volumes in several markets and drove margin mix higher for the consolidated portfolio in the quarter. The breadth and diversity of our end market exposures, along with proactive cost containment and pricing discipline led to another record high quarterly segment margin in Q4. We remained active on the portfolio front. We improved our portfolio through synergistic bolt-on acquisitions, including two transactions announced in January that add attractive reoccurring and software revenue streams with good growth exposures to our mix. We expect to close the DESTACO sale by the end of the first quarter, which will further enhance our cash position. We entered 2024 in a significantly better financial position than we were 12 months ago. Underlying demand across the majority of the portfolio is solid. Bookings momentum is improving, and we drove the first organic bookings growth in eight quarters. Of note, biopharma book-to-bill was above one, signifying an improving sentiment in the market which is also evident in the recently announced results of some customers and channel partners. While we expect seasonality in idiosyncratic headwinds such as European heat pumps and can-making equipment to weigh on volumes in the first half. Overall, we expect demand conditions to progressively improve off the fourth quarter exit rate through the year. Our recent investments puts us in a very strong position to capture secular growth across numerous end markets like CO2 refrigeration, bioprocessing, data center cooling, electricification of heating and cooling and smart compressor controls. In-flight cost actions provide carryover benefits in 2024 with specific projects to be announced during the year. Lastly, our balance sheet has ample capacity to execute against a strong acquisition pipeline and pursue opportunistic capital return strategies as we continue to upgrade the portfolio over time. Let's go to Slide 4. Consolidated organic revenue was down 3% in the quarter. Bookings were up 2% organically, reflecting growing order rate momentum across much of the portfolio. Segment margin was up 100 basis points to 22% on broad-based productivity and port portfolio improvements. Free cash flow in the quarter was over $450 million or 22% of revenue on improved working capital efficiency and lower CapEx. Adjusted EPS was up 13% to $2.45 per share in the quarter. Our guide for 2024 reflects a constructive outlook. We are guiding for organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $8.95 to $9.15 [ph] per share, which represents a 5% to 7% year-over-year organic growth, excluding the tax reorganization benefit recognized in the fourth. Let's skip to Slide 5. Engineered Products had a solid quarter driven particularly strong volume growth in conversion and waste handling. Chassis availability improved in the quarter and the business has reservations from large national waste haulers and municipalities well into 2024. Europe and Asia shipments were notably lower in vehicle aftermarket, but bookings improved during the quarter. Margin performance improved 270 basis points on positive mix benefits and volume conversion on recent productivity investments in the waste-hauling business, coupled with a solid performance in Aerospace and Defense. Clean Energy and fueling is our most distribution leverage segment, and as such, is where we intervened aggressively on production to facilitate general channel destocking in below-ground retail fueling, hanging hardware, LPG components and car wash in the quarter. Cryogenic components continued their robust growth and above-ground fueling equipment was up on continued recovery in U.S. dispensers. We believe that our proactive intervention on production in Q4 has allowed excess channel inventory to clear and we expect this business in this segment to return to normal booking and shipping posture in 2024 with normal seasonality levered to quarters 2 and 3. Imaging & ID posted another as projected stable quarter against a difficult comparable period with a high degree of reoccurring revenue, end market and geographic diversity and exposures to growing regulatory requirements for product ID and traceability. This segment remains a consistent performer with strong margins and cash flows. Margin performance in the quarter was exemplary. Pumps & Process Solutions was up organically in the quarter on strong shipments in polymer processing and precision components. The integration of FW Murphy is off to a strong start with a good reception from our customers and notable recent wins of substantial reoccurring revenue contracts in remote monitoring and smart compressor technology. Top line performance and climate and sustainability technologies was impacted by expected volume declines in beverage can making and as well as the recent and abrupt industry slowing in the broader HVAC complex in Europe and Asia, most notably in residential heat pumps, demand - the degree of which was not incorporated in our previous forecast. Margin performance was exceptional in the quarter, driven by improvement in food retail, which posted EBIT margins in excess of 15% in the fourth quarter, traditionally a seasonally slower quarter on positive CO2 product mix and productivity. The food retail team deserves accommodation for their operational achievements to drive significant margin accretion in these past 3 years, but we still have further runway to improve largely on improved product mix. I'll pass it on to Brad here. Okay. I'm on Slide 9. This highlights the results of some recent investments behind several fast-growing platforms and portfolio. A few years ago, these were nascent product lines with about $50 million in combined revenue. We saw a significant growth opportunity in these markets and proactively organically invested in CapEx and R&D to cultivate technological leadership and provide a sufficient foundation for these businesses to win and scale with customers. We are in the early innings of capitalizing on these investments and are excited about their long-term prospects. Across these markets, we enjoy leadership positions with recognized technology and strong relationships with marquee customers. With about $200 million in combined revenue planned for this year and a double-digit long-term growth trajectory, we expect these platforms to become meaningful contributors to Dover's overall growth profile. Slide 10 shows progress against our capital deployment priorities. After several years of elevated capital investments into capacity, productivity and automation projects, we expect capital expenditures to be lower in 2024. We continue seeking high confidence, high return on investment, organic investments, and we'll prioritize those in our capital allocation decisions. Acquisitions remain part and parcel to building a better and stronger Dover. We have been actively shaping our portfolio in line with these priorities and we indicated to investors pulled through at - through additions and subtractions as we work to reshape and enhance the portfolio towards higher growth, higher return and lower cyclicality. Our cash flow position and capital allocation optionality are far superior compared to term [ph] last year. We expect another year of solid free cash flow generation in '24, with the added benefit of sale proceeds from DESTACO should close at the end of February, the beginning of March. We have ample balance sheet capacity to continue improving our portfolio through accretive acquisitions. We're opportunistically return capital to our shareholders. Moving to Slide 11 shows the long-term financial performance of the portfolio. Despite the top line headwinds we experienced in '20 and '23 over the past 5 years, we have grown organic revenue at a 4% annualized rate ahead of GDP and industrial averages. Our margin performance over that period was solid, up 410 basis points in aggregate at a conversion margin in excess of our long-term targets we laid out and primarily driven by operational improvement and product mix. Finally, let's go to Slide 12. Our top line growth in 2024 will be driven by our secular growth exposed end markets, including CO2, data center cooling, heating, electrification and cryogenic components. The near-term outlook for precision components remain strong as demand for infrastructure investment tied to the energy transition is driving increased demand for our compressor components and engineered bearings. Our waste handling business is effectively booked for the year and to continue its double-digit growth trajectory as chassis shortage abates and haulers work to publish - replenish and upgrade their fleets. Based on recent history, we have incorporated appropriate caution in our forecast for biopharma during the year, but we are confident that we will post year-on-year growth in this end market, and we'll update our view as the year progresses. Full year consolidated operating margin is forecasted to improve on volume, product mix and productivity actions. We have done the hard work to get our channel inventories and balance and expect revenue to build off the fourth quarter exit rate with a return to pre-COVID seasonality in several businesses. Our portfolio consists of a collection of businesses that operate in attractive and unique - niche end markets. Our business model is flexible, and we can quickly respond in changes in market dynamics, be the beneficial or detrimental to the business. We have numerous cost control levels and capital allocation optionality at our disposal to deliver on our full year forecast. I'd like to thank our global teams for the efforts to deliver last year's results, and we look forward to serving our customers, partners and investors in the year and ahead. And Jack, let's go to Q&A. Good morning. I would expect the bookings stays positive throughout '24 based on our outlook right now. I think that the channel - we've done the hard work on the channel inventory, and that's where we're seeing the inflection in the bookings, whether it be biopharma and that we would expect to see the same in Fueling Solutions. So I don't expect this trend - I don't expect to go negative unless we're going to have an unforeseen recession in 2024. It's not a coincidence that we did this call behind some of our customers because we had been in front of them and been wrong. We have very little accretion in earnings on biopharma despite the fact that order rates are beginning to pick up, we'd rather position ourself cautiously. And if you go back and look at the transcript, it said we were just going to update you where we are quarter-by-quarter. So I think that we're going to wait and see what we can say as we do not expect it to be down year-over-year, but we have not incorporated anything - any meaningful amount of operating profit up year-over-year. We'll keep that to ourselves until we see the orders. Yeah. You are absolutely correct. Hi, Andy. I think that it will start slowly. So I think the Q1 will be kind of a roll forward of what we saw in Q4 to a certain extent. But again, you've got some difficult comps. I would expect by Q2 - the vast majority of accretion will occur in Q2s and Q3 as we ramp production into that. And then Q4 - Q4 was actually pretty strong for us. Usually, it's a run for working capital. But again, like every other year, it's going to be highly dependent on production rates that we adopt for Q4. Well, there's a lot of moving parts of what's in Clean Energy. I'd - to back up for a moment. I think that the operating posture that we adopted at-- as we move through Q3 into Q4, was predicated upon of dropping production to flush total channel inventory. And I think that we've accomplished that across the total portfolio. As you mentioned, I think what was not incorporated into our Q4 forecast was the sudden decline in demand on Heat Exchanges for Heat Pumps. Again, like biopharma, I think that we're going to be very cautious about that for '24 until we see the market return. So right now, I think that we're calling Heat Pumps down year-over-year, but I think that, that may prove to be conservative. I think that my own view is it's probably going to flush in Q1 and Q2, and then we'll return to growth on the other side. So overall, outside of Heat Exchangers for Heat Pumps, I think that we're in pretty good shape in terms of balance. And so what's incorporated into the 1 to 3 is basically that's the aggregate of demand that we see. So production demand should be pretty much in balance. So we will probably build some inventory in Q1 as we ramp back up for Q2 and Q3, but that's kind of the way we see it right now. No, right? Because you've got Belvac rolling down year-over-year, which we've expected for 3 years. If Heat Exchangers stays with our forecast, which is very conservative, the CO2 revenue growth will not offset that, but I think that we're being cautious until we see what happens and when we see what all our customers say about Heat Pump demand for 2024. You're welcome. Hey, Scott. Sure. Yes. Look, look, I think that the China number is kind of - first of all, China as a percent of our revenue now is, I don't know, 7% or 8%, 6% now, okay, 6%. So that number on the law of small numbers, when we make a big shipment into China out of polymer processing, it swings the numbers. Now the base business that - the remaining base business that we have in China is a reflection of the Chinese economy. It's not great. But it flexed up because of that. Europe is really a couple of things. Well, first of all, the European economy is not great, but it's been exasperated in the quarter by the sudden shift down in demand in heat exchanges or heat pumps where we went from an operating posture of selling absolutely everything we could make to selling hardly anything in about mid-September. So I think there was a market-wide recognition that inventory got over their skis a little bit, so that needs to clear. So what was baked into our forecast next year is I don't think that we're overly optimistic on Chinese demand. I think the European demand in aggregate should improve year-over-year only because of the fact of that idiosyncratic headwind that we had. But the vast majority of the growth that we've got baked into our forecast is North America driven. Well, I mean, look, yes, sure. No, I understand the question. Look, at the end of the day, the reason that we put the one slide together in terms of firepower, it was an odd dynamic coming out of COVID where earnings accretion was great, but there wasn't a lot of cash flow because it was all getting hung up in supply chain and inventory and everything else. So what we expected going into this year was this is the year we've got to generate a bunch of cash. Now we've had ample balance sheet capacity during that time period. So it's not like we haven't been doing M&A because we were waiting to build this cash position. But on the other hand, I think our ability for M&A and capital return is significantly better just on pure cash than it was 12 months ago. So you would expect us to be more active in the deployment. Now we've closed three acquisitions in the last, what, 5 months. We've got a decent pipeline of acquisitions that kind of look like that. Would we like to do something bigger? Sure. But we've got some return hurdles that - if we can't find something with those return hurdles, then we'll return the cash to shareholders. So that's the posture we always adopt. So it's not like we got to go find X amount of M&A every year. We need to find things that are attractive from a return point of view. And if we can't, it's coming back to our shareholder base. Thanks. Hey, Mike. I don't think that we're getting over our skis in terms of demand. At the end of the day, we've got one to three in top line. Now taking to that one to three is we've got a small amount of dilution because we sold the DESTACO [ph] versus what we brought into the portfolio. I think from an earnings point of view, that neutralized itself, but not from a top line point of view, when I take a look at the math. We've got certain parts of the portfolio that have just done fantastically which would be can-making equipment and polymer processing equipment where are cycling down. So we've known about this coming [ph] and that's why we've been investing in a variety of other portions of the portfolio to cycle up and we're going to take a look that we had a couple of footfalls last year that we don't expect to repeat. So net-net, the underlying growth is higher than one, three because we're incorporating the headwind that we have on some of the cyclical portions of the portfolio, but it's not as if we're baking in this return on just overall GDP growth, I think that what's really baked into our growth is where we have invested. So like what we just try to highlight on that page. I mean, we've taken - we've got a significant amount of revenue growth on three platforms that really didn't exist in the group up until a year ago of any consequence. So the growth is a little bit better than the highlight figure just because of the headwinds we got on the cyclical ones. And it's largely driven on specific products and end market exposure rather than AG, the Fed's going to drop interest rates and GDP is going to expand. It's decent. It really - the industrial pump side never really had the kind of headwind in terms of stocking and destocking. And that's really high-value equipment. So it's more or less fundamental demand. I think there was some caution in the back half of '23 just because of the carryover of interest rates and everything else. I think what's baked into our forecast this year is some growth, but not anything extraordinary on the industrial side. Thanks. Yeah. Hi. Price is about a point to a point and a half. And on volume, I think... Yes. So a point to a point and a half, and so it's 50-50 on price volume. And I think that we've done the hard work because of what the argument of against price is inventory balances. And I think that the one way you can protect price is not get over your skis in terms of inventory. And I think based on what you see in our cash flow that we've done the hard work for a good setup there. So right now, all we need to do is toggle production with orders at this point. Yes. I mean you can see it in clean energy for sure. How's up for an answer. I know it's so dependent on mix. We'd like to see a quarter or two before we want to put a hard number on it. But I think that by and large, we should mix up this year. Right. I think that Q1 will be more of a reflection of Q4. So I don't get all worked up about the comp. And then we bought - we get the absorption because we ramp from there and then regular seasonality. The vast majority of the accretion in EPS should be Q2 and Q3. And by the time we get to the half year, we'll probably have a good idea of where we stand on Q4. But I think that we put it in all the caution that we can just in terms of the macro, right? This is - our fundamental forecast is basically what we think volume is going to be by vertical here that - so we think that we can hit these numbers. And if we get a better macro or we get biopharma or return on some amount of HVAC that we're ready to go, but we prefer - rather than trying to lead that like we have over the last couple of years and speaking to those end markets, it's more of a show me. It comes, we'll upgrade our forecasting. Thanks. Joe. I mean we're committed to managing the portfolio. I think we sold DESTACO, I think, at a pretty good price in 2023. We've just - we've closed three acquisitions over the last five months where I think are margin accretive and more growth-oriented assets. So I think we'll do the same thing. I think that bigger portfolio moves, you need balance sheet optionality. And I think that if you look at what the knock-on effect of the really good cash flow that we have this past year is our balance sheet optionality is in a really good place. So - which we can be more prosaic about what that means, but at least the building blocks that we need to continue to shape portfolio have improved year-over-year. Let me put it to you that way. Well, I mean, the headline figure at one to three, you need to take into account that we know where we have cyclical headwinds going forward, right? So we had banked significant profits out of polymer processing and can-making equipment that we knew this headwind was coming. So in that one to three, we're making all that up. We've got a bit of a headwind in terms of the disposal of DESTACO coming out, that the acquisitions, I think on a profit point of view, neutralizes it, but not from a top line point of view. And then I think that we've - unlike previous years where we've kind of led forecasting in terms of biopharma and HVAC components because those are battlegrounds. We've taken a very cautious stance on that, and we're going to wait to see how the market develops. Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Some, right. Look, if you calculate the EPS accretion on a cautious top line that you'd come with an incremental margin that is pretty high, right? So at the end of the day, what's incorporated in there is a little bit of capital deployment, whether that be in M&A activity or share repurchase. The timing of which we'll let you know when it happens. Well, that chart actually foots to the chart that we put out in 2020 in terms of the hierarchy of capital allocation to a certain - well, I think the DPPS and DCEF kind of flipped, but that - because you can't control in terms of closing acquisitions. Yes, I mean, overall, yes. I mean if you think that engineered products outside of defense has been an organic issue for us for some time. And DCST, Belvac and SWEP are organic and I think in refrigeration, I think that what we've done with the total investment, that would be an organic play also. So yes, I think that the hierarchy there, they may flip around a little bit, but it's largely correct. I think it's broad based, and I think it's more influenced by what do we call them, the thermal connectors. You're welcome. Good morning. Well, you touched on them all, Julian. Yes. I mean, look, we cut production in DCF to manage inventory. So that is not just the lost products that we sell. It's all - and we did it on the underground portion of the business, which is highly margin accretive. So we get that back and it's reflected in Q4, and it's reflected in the year-over-year. So we would expect as we balance production that returns. Engineered Products, really the bulk of the margin accretion in '23 was driven by ESG, but that was more or less back half and we expect a full year of that going into 2024. And if you recall, we had a little bit of a hiccup with an implementation of ERP and VSG last year, which we don't expect to reoccur again. So that's helpful. PII, what do we close at? 25% margins. That's great. So that's more a revenue issue for us. DPPS has had a biopharma headwind now for 2-plus years. What we're calling here it's no longer a headwind and whatever we get on the top side, which we're not baking in a lot right now or hardly anything is going to be accretive. And the DCST has got - right now in our forecast would be margin down on mix because Belvac, which we knew was going to come down and our cautious stance on heat pumps. If we're wrong about being cautious about heat pumps, then that will flex that will - the headwind will be less than we've got modeled into our forecast for the year. Yes, I'm not going to go - it's - Q1 will be more of a reflection of the carryforward of Q4. What we'll get is some amount of production ramp, but a lot of bad comps and then we accelerate right out of there. Welcome. Yes. If we go back and look at the transcript, Nigel, we do have carryforward from actions that we took in the back half of the year. We've got some coming. I'm not ready to calendarize it yet because they're not fully baked, but we do have a list of - we do have a list of cost actions, which are more of a revenue hedge. So if we take those actions and we're right on the demand profile, those should actually be accretive to us. So they're not necessarily baked in at this point. And the reason they're not baked in is because we're working on the timing in terms of the execution. Yes, it's interesting. I mean, if you go back and look at our realized pricing, and I'm talking about the portion of the pricing that's fallen all the way to the bottom line, it has not been dramatic for us. And it's a source of consternation around here of what is capable in pricing. And so if we look at some of our end market customers and what they've passed through on pricing, I guess that we've been jealous for lack of better words. So to us, it's been - we've - I don't want to be negative. I think we've taken some price I don't feel that we've got a couple of businesses that have escalation, de-escalation clauses in terms of inputs. I think we've been on the front foot in those businesses of being proactive about locking in our pricing, especially going into this year. So right now, we've actually got a little bit of room if we had to give back pricing, but that's not my expectation. Our issue has always been that the way to defend pricing is not to get over your skis and inventory, and that's why we took it into the neck to a certain extent to kind of manage that position at the end of last year going into kind of the demand environment, at least the setup as we see it today, I think that we feel good about our ability to protect price. Thanks, Deane. You know what, I don't know. So I would expect if it's been terrible, I would have heard something. Usually, when it's positive, no one tells me anything. But - so we haven't even closed the month yet, Deane. So - but I'm unaware of it being worse than what we have baked in. It's almost exclusively levered towards liquid cooling. That's correct. Yeah. But we supply everybody. Got it?"

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrey Galiuk: Thank you, Angela. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through November 14, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Thanks, Andrey. We posted very encouraging results [and let us] become a dynamic operating environment across our different end markets and geographies. Revenue and order rates improved sequentially in the quarter on normalizing lead times and inventories, improving demands across several end markets and a return to normal seasonality. Our backlog continued to normalize in the quarter, in tandem with lead times as we shipped longer-dated orders from our books. Broadly speaking, margins performance in the quarter was exceptional, reaching an all-time high driven by productivity, cost controls and disciplined pricing, which more than offset the negative product mix in Pumps & Process Solutions. The proactive structural cost actions we have undertaken over the last 12 months are paying dividends and should support strong margin conversion going forward. Our recent portfolio moves, the acquisition of FW Murphy and the sale of De-Sta-Co followed the portfolio intent and priorities that we reiterated at our Investor Day earlier in the year and continued our portfolio evolution towards higher-growth and higher-return businesses at attractive valuations. Our balance sheet position and cash flow are strong and provide attractive optionality as we continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions in a more favorable M&A environment and evaluate opportunistic capital return strategies. We have reduced our EPS guidance for the full-year and are now targeting the low-end of the previous guidance range. This is driven by continued lag in biopharma recovery that we expected to happen in the second half of the year. Temporary cost and supply chain issues that I'll expand upon later and a general trend towards inventory liquidation across supply chains as a result of macro uncertainty and prohibitive carrying costs, I'll cover the specifics in the segment commentary. Overall, demand remains good across the portfolio, considering the plentiful negative macro headlines. Our new product launches and capacity additions and identified areas of growth are all on track, and we expect that our fourth quarter production posture will help balance our channel inventories with prevailing demand, lead times and inventory carrying costs by the end of 2023. We are increasingly convinced that inventory position will be critical to the pricing dynamic and financial results moving into 2024. Going into 2024, we expect to see growth in our bookings driven by secular growth exposed in recovering end markets, and we expect to carry an elevated backlog into next year in select businesses. Between our demand outlook, flexible business model and in-flight structural cost actions, we see good foundation for value creation in 2024. Let's move on to the performance highlights on Page 4. Consolidated revenue was down 2% in the quarter despite sequential growth in four out of five segments. Bookings were up sequentially, but down 4% organically year-over-year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.93, reflecting better lead times and strong shipments against our longer-dated orders. As a result, our backlog continued to normalize, but remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Segment margins were up 50 basis points to 21.7%, a record since the Apergy spin as broadly based productivity and portfolio improvements were more than able to offset biopharma mix. Adjusted EPS was up 4% to $2.35 in the quarter. And positive price/cost dynamics, together with cost containment actions, strong execution, more than offset lower volumes. Let's go to Slide 5. Engineered Products was down 3% organically in the quarter. General weakness in Europe and Asia, together with lower shipments in vehicle service, more than offset the record quarter in aerospace and defense and strong shipments in waste hauling. Order rates in the segment were up 12% organically in the quarter, primarily driven by waste handling business, which continues to take capacity reservations well into 2024. Margins at 20% were up 260 basis points year-over-year driven by a better mix of recurring and aftermarket revenue, price/cost and productivity investments made in previous periods. I'd like to mention the announcement of our agreement to divest De-Sta-Co, one of the operating units within the Engineered Products segments and an attractive valuation. This is not related to [indiscernible] performance, but we leave the valuation we achieved underscores the quality and strong performance of the businesses that we have proven to have best-in-class operating margin and less cyclicality than typical capital goods businesses. Clean Energy & Fueling revenue was flat organically in the quarter. We saw double-digit growth in components for LNG and hydrogen markets. And the aboveground retail fueling business returned to growth as post-EMV recovery is in progress. High interest rates led to project push-outs in vehicle wash and an unforecasted channel destocking has resulted in slower activity in LPG components and belowground fueling, which are highly margin accretive to the segment. Margins in the quarter were at 20%, were up 40 basis points on structural cost actions in our retail fueling business and solid execution more than offset negative mix.  Imaging & ID was down 4% organically as slowing demand in China and a difficult comparable period in marking and coding printer shipments more than offset the growth in serialization software and marking and coding consumables and professional services. Margins in Imaging & ID was strong at 26%, though down year-over-year against an all-time record high for the segment in the comparable quarter. Pumps & Process Solutions was down 7% organically in the quarter. Precision components and hygienic dosing systems posted another quarter of excellent growth, but were more than offset by the continued softness in biopharma. Industrial pumps and polymer processing [were stable] in the quarter. Segment margin of 27% was down to the lower mix of biopharma revenue. Topline in Climate & Sustainability Technologies was up 2% organically. CO2 systems continued its double-digit growth trajectory. Heat exchanger shipments remained strong in North America and Europe, though we experienced the beginning of demand headwinds in Asia. The segment posted strong margin performance of 18% in the quarter with our food retail business or refrigeration business operating at a robust 15% margin. The steady margin improvement trajectory in refrigeration has been noteworthy as positive mix and productivity investments have driven excellent margin conversion. We expect the margin improvement trend to continue for the whole segment. I'll pass it on to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. The top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 2%. Both acquisitions and FX translation contributed positive 1% to the topline in the quarter. FX, which has been a headwind for the past year and a half resulted in $0.02 of positive EPS impact in the quarter. Based on recent movement in the euro/dollar exchange rate, we now expect FX to be a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind in the fourth quarter. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market was down 7% in the quarter due to lower shipments in vehicle service, biopharma, LPG components and belowground retail fueling. Europe was down 5% and Asia was down 3%. China, which represents about half of our revenue base in Asia, was down 5% organically in the quarter. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to normalization of lead times and strong shipments against elevated backlogs. Now on our cash flow statement, Slide 8. Year-to-date, free cash flow came in at $688 million or 11% of revenue, represented an increase of nearly $400 million year-over-year. As discussed previously, with supply chains improving, we have begun actively working to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023. We accelerated our inventory reduction in the third quarter and expect the trend to continue as we plan to balance our inventory levels by the end of the year. Free cash flow generation has historically peaked in the fourth quarter. And again, we expect strong fourth quarter cash flow to finish the year. Our forecast for 2023 free cash flow is 13% to 15% of revenue. Let me turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: All right. I'm on Slide 9. We expect Engineered Products to generate moderate growth in the fourth quarter. Aerospace and defense should remain strong. Meanwhile, the auto strike will weigh on several businesses in the near-term. Growth in our waste handling business, which is expected to be robust in the fourth quarter into 2024 will be reduced in the near-term by recent strike at a major truck OEM impacting deliveries. Shipments in vehicle aftermarket expected to be lower versus a record previous year on higher interest rates weigh on service shop's ability to finance CapEx. We expect margins to improve in the quarter on positive price/cost tailwinds and benefits from our recent productivity capital investments. Clean Energy & Fueling is expected to remain steady. Clean energy, LNG and hydrogen components should continue their robust trajectory and order trends in aboveground retail fueling point to continued post-EMV recovery. We expect channel destocking and interest rate-driven headwinds in the belowground fueling segment, LPG components and vehicle wash to maintain through year-end. We expect stable margin performance as the $60 million in aggregate structural cost containment actions in retail fueling should offset negative mix from lower belowground and lower car wash volumes. Imaging & ID is expected to be down organically against a difficult comparable period driven by slowing demand in Asia and a subdued outlook for textiles. Serialization software should continue its growth trajectory. Our new customer conversion margin performance should remain at attractive levels at this segment. Pumps & Process is expected to remain roughly flat organically in the fourth quarter. Precision components should continue growth tailwinds from energy transition projects. Polymer processing is booked for the year. The recovery in biopharma components has been very subdued. And although channel inventory levels are now below pre-pandemic levels, end customer demand has not recovered enough to drive 2023 growth despite earlier forecast indicating recovery. We have reduced our production and inventory levels appropriately and will remain in this posture for the balance of the year. This is generally a short-cycle business, and we can ramp as order rates recover in 2024. We expect year-over-year margin headwinds on negative mix in biopharma. And after several years of impressive topline growth, Climate & Sustainability Technologies is expect to moderate in the fourth quarter as demand for heat exchangers abruptly slowed in Q3 due to near-term uncertainty in European heat pumps. As a result, we are reducing production levels to allow for inventory to be cleared in the fourth quarter. Traditional refrigeration demand will retain its seasonality with reduced activity during the holiday season. But we continue to see robust demand for our CO2 refrigeration systems and are ramping up production and go-to-market efforts appropriately. We expect continued year-over-year margin improvement through year-end on productivity gains and improved mix. Going to Slide 10. Our updated EPS guide reflects the near-term changes in demand and our production posture, temporary and isolated issues in the supply chain and costs related to acquisitions, integration and divestment activities. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in Q4 as a result of tax reorganization activities driven by upcoming regulatory changes. As I've highlighted, we believe our changed operating and production posture focused on reducing inventories and prioritizing cash flow over volume in reaction to the dynamic operating environment is critical to setting up 2024 outlook where we can maintain and expand operating margins. Let's go to Slide 11 and take a quick look at the inorganic moves that we made during the quarter. Here, we summarized the two recently announced transaction that align well with our portfolio priorities and enhance the overall quality of Dover's portfolio through margin growth and reoccurring revenue uplift, all while reducing our exposure to automotive and China. Importantly, we are able to acquire FW Murphy, a lower valuation multiple than our sale of De-Sta-Co and the after-tax proceeds from the De-Sta-Co sale more than pay for FW Murphy, preserving significant balance sheet capacity for additional capital deployment options. Slide 12 provides more color on the rationale for the acquisition of FW Murphy by our precision components operating unit, which is part of Pumps & Process Solutions segment. FW Murphy brings a highly complementary product offering to our existing position in reciprocating compression industry. FW Murphy Solutions capitalized on the growing adoption of advanced remote monitoring, control real-time optimization solutions as customers seek to reduce costs, improve uptime and lower emissions. In combination with our best-in-class clean technology and our leading position in sealing and valve technology for alternative energy applications, including in hydrogen, the FW Murphy acquisition offers a compelling value proposition into a global industry where we see robust demand from energy transition investments. The FW Murphy acquisition provides a good segue into our next topic, which is to highlight, the recent developments in investment in sustainability-driven markets, starting on Slide 13. There has been plenty of interest around hydrogen as a result of the recent announcement of $7 billion in federal funding for multiple regional hydrogen hubs that are expected to also attract $40 billion in private funding and a roster of blue chip industry participants. Dover has established a position in hydrogen with the 2021 acquisition of Acme, which supplies flow control components for liquid hydrogen and [indiscernible], which offers turnkey hydrogen refueling sites. Additionally, we are organically invested in extending DPCs gas compression components to participate in gaseous hydrogen applications. In short, there is no hydrogen economy without compression. We have great relationships with the industrial gas and hydrogen players and aim to participate throughout the whole value chain through transport and storage through end-use in collaboration with equipment OEMs. We are well positioned to capitalize on growth in hydrogen and industry with a high focus on safety and regulatory compliance with high technological requirements for participation. Moving to Slide 14. The EPA recently finalized its rule under the AIM Act with a deadline for new installation of refrigeration systems to be compliant with lower GWP requirements by January of 2027. We believe this rule is a clear tailwind to our CO2 systems business. And we have had a leading position in the European CO2 market for over a decade where we enjoyed steady double-digit growth trajectory. We were the early mover in transplanting this technology to the U.S. where we currently enjoy technological lead and have the largest installed based and broadest differentiated offering. We have proactively expanded our capacity in addition and in participation of market growth and have been investing behind a platform-based product strategy to drive standardization, thereby reducing costs for ourselves and our customers, improving product quality and simplifying the sales process. Our global CO2 business is approximately $200 million in revenue. The U.S. market is in the early innings, and our business is on track for 30% growth in 2023 with a strong outlook. We are also excited about our new CO2-based heat pump offerings for industrial and district heating applications. It's early days, but we have an active pipeline of orders. And finally, on Slide 15 shows our latest views on heat exchangers since it has become a battleground topic. Our heat exchanger business supplies brazed plate technology, which is currently the most sustainable commercialized heat transfer technology for fluids. We have been the clear beneficiary of the sustainability and climate tailwinds across various applications with a lot of attention drawn recently from our participation as a key supplier to hydronic heat pumps. Heat pumps have emerged in recent years as a technology of choice to decarbonize residential heating, which is responsible for a significant portion of global emissions with hydronic heat pumps as a primary technology to retrofit houses that rely on water-based heating. Legislative initiatives in European Union and individual countries are driving the conversion of fossil fuel boiler with heat pumps. Recent uncertainties about subsidies in select European countries have weighed on near-term volumes, as I indicated earlier. Our exposure across multiple OEMs and geographies, and as such, we are not over-indexed to any product or customer concentration risk. We remain confident about the long-term growth prospects for heat pumps and our technology. It is important to note that European residential heat pumps represent only a quarter of our heat exchanger business. You see several solid growth vectors driven by sustainability tailwinds and continue to share gains from other legacy heat exchanger technologies. We have proactively expanded our capacity as we expect continued robust growth trajectory in heat exchangers, albeit with slightly lower rates in the near-term as various dynamics in Europe slow down. I close my prepared remarks by thanking our global teams for driving our strong financial performance during the quarter. And it's time for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So I think you were a little more positive in early September than this fourth quarter guidance, understand maybe the world's changed a little bit since then. Maybe you could just discuss that. But then just looking ahead, thinking about perhaps a more cautious view of the world for next year. What's kind of a low-end assumption for next year when it comes to organic and margins? Just to kind of level set us on a case where perhaps the orders don't recouple as strongly to the trend lines or the trend lines are a little bit weaker. Like in your macro view, what is a more cautious outlook for next year bring for Dover? Because you've been talking about growth there as things recouple the trend. It seems like that would have changed over the last month or so.\nRichard Tobin: Okay. That's a lot to take on this. Steve, let's give it a try. Look, I think if we look at our forecast for the year, we were just wrong about biopharma. I mean, we were getting indications from our customers that there was going to be some nascent recovery. We actually did see some order upticks, but quite frankly, it just never turned into much. So that's a little bit different than we were back in September. I think we just have to throw in the towel on biopharma demand and it gets pushed to 2024. We didn't expect in terms of market dynamics was this UAW on trucks, right? We thought it would stay limited into the car sector. And unfortunately, what we were betting on is being able to ship quite heavily out of ESG in Q4. We'll actually have a good quarter in Q4, but it's not going to be as robust in our plans. I think I mentioned on the heat exchangers. That was a little bit of an abrupt reversal and really didn't happen until almost the end of Q3. So up until about 30 days ago. Everything looked good there. And I think that we've got a little bit of a pivot as what we understand is there's a lot of finished goods in the supply chain that need to be reduced from there. So at the end of the day, I think it slowed some and \u2013 which leads into the next question. And the next question, our positioning now is to drive for cash because I think that the way we're going to be able to protect margins into 2024 is not to be long inventory. We had a lot of discussions around here about incentivizing revenue in 2024 driving revenue, but then you start touching on things like price and you start touching on things like payment terms, and we're not going there. I mean I think that the strategy that we have is to adapt quickly and efficiently to the market demand, bring down our inventory with the hope of \u2013 with the strategy of protecting margin into next year. And I think if you look at how we've handled demand this year, it's exactly what we've done at the end of the day. I mean, we talked about it before. What we had seen over the previous two years was not a lot of unitary demand. You saw a lot of pricing going into the system. So we came into this year saying, there's probably going to be less price and some unitary demand, but the important \u2013 and I think that we've done that in terms of managing, which is reflected in our margins year-to-date, is managing not getting oversupply and over our SKUs a little bit in terms of inventory and that we're going to take that on for next year. Do you want me to make a call on the market next year? I think we're going to have to wait on that. Clearly, there's a lot of headwinds in the system. I don't want to get on a personal soapbox, but the amount of liquidity that's being withdrawn is going to show up somewhere. And this notion that we're all going to wait on the government to bail us out because of this wave of government spending coming, I find that a problematic strategy. So I think it all is going to be triggered by monetary policy between now and the end of the year, which is going to allow for us to predict growth into next year. What I can tell you is, is if we do what we're planning on doing in Q4, we will not be long inventory, and we're not going to get into a situation where if there are kind of topline headwinds that we're going to have to start playing price to drive growth.\nSteve Tusa: So like should we just think about flat as a starting point for next year?\nRichard Tobin: No, I don't think so. I think that we're ahead of the curve. Remember, we're a component supplier into end market industries, right? So we're first at the end of the day. So I think that if we get this right, we've got topline growth next year, even in a pretty benign kind of macro environment, I think that we can drive growth. And I think that's part of the reason that we covered some of those growth vectors in terms of our investment at the end of the presentation.\nSteve Tusa: Great. All right. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Rich, maybe a question on restructuring and thinking fueling in particular. I think you had a lot of restructuring planned there for Q4, but it looks like you're guiding margins kind of flat, I guess, on a year-over-year basis. Could you speak to that? Maybe it's some of the absorption issues you're talking about on inventory, but love some more color on the margin trajectory there?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. I think if you go back and look at the script, basically, what it says is the restructuring that we took is going to protect margins into Q4 because we actually have a poor mix forecasted for Q4 because where we've been seeing the headwinds in Fueling Solutions is in the below-ground portion of the segment, and that is highly accretive to margins. We're basically \u2013 you heard me answer Steve's question there, we're taking the position of let's allow inventory to be draw down even we would argue at this point, below even normal levels between now and the end of the year and protect production performance into next year. So the restructuring benefit \u2013 the restructuring that we've done is actually protecting margins into Q4.\nJeffrey Sprague: And on these questions of just kind of what's at the customer level, right, whether it was biopharma earlier this year, heat pumps, maybe now, some other pockets, how would you kind of square up your visibility and kind of comfort level on understanding what the right level of inventory is or when the customer demand equation might turn a little bit?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I think we're getting a lot better at it. At the end of the day, where we sell through distribution, we have visibility, right, because we've just got a material position within distribution, so we can see pretty much stocking levels. At the OEM level, it becomes a lot more difficult. At the end of the day, we're relying on the OEMs to basically tell us their own position. So let's take heat exchangers. Up until 45 days ago, it was still a demand capacity deficit of give us everything you've got and then all of a sudden, for reasons that I tried to cover, the markets come to a halt because there's a recognition of the seemingly is a lot of finished goods in the chain now that need to be bled off. So like I said, from \u2013 if it's distribution, I think that we've got a pretty good handle on it. When it's OEM, we just got to take the signals from them.\nJeffrey Sprague: I'm sorry, just a quick one for Brad. Does the tax rate bounce back to 20-something next year? Or what should we expect going forward?\nBrad Cerepak: Yes, Jeff, the things we're seeing here in Q3 and into Q4 on taxes, will not carry into next year. So said differently, I think our 2024 tax rate is going to be much like we saw earlier in this year when we gave guidance, somewhere in that 20% to 22% rate.\nJeffrey Sprague: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Rich, how would you characterize kind of the excess backlog at this point in time, and how that kind of interplays into the revenue you'll see versus kind of the bookings trends that you need?\nRichard Tobin: I don't think that we have excess backlog anymore. I mean, I think that we're \u2013 by the end of the year, we will have drawn down our longer cycle backlog, particularly in Belvac and MAAG, which drove a lot of it. I think it will end up being a little bit higher than kind of on average in terms of its aggregate, if you go back and look over the last five years, but that is more related to portfolio \u2013 general portfolio mix as opposed to anything else. So like I said, at the end of the year, we think that we'll be in balance between our inventory and our \u2013 either the customer distribution inventory, I would expect the long-cycle business backlogs to be done that reduction to be done by the end of the year.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then I know it's tough to ask about bookings, but do you see bookings sequentially increasing in the fourth quarter then?\nRichard Tobin: I got to go back and take a look. I mean, I would say flat. If I think about where bookings are coming from, we got a lot in ESG at high dollar value because quite frankly, we're booking well into 2024 in that particular business just because of supply constraints. Flat, I would call it right now. I think that there's an overall caution with the macro \u2013 everybody recognizes that lead times have been vastly reduced. So I think that there's going to be a lot of hurry for bookings in Q4, but we would expect a pretty large acceleration in Q1, if we\u2019ve got.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Understood. Thank you very much.\nRichard Tobin: Welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Halloran: Hey, good morning everyone. Two here. So first, on the inventory side, you're obviously bringing your inventory down a fair amount pretty aggressively, more so than what we're hearing elsewhere. Do you have the same sense of urgency in the channel when you look at your channel partners? Or do you think they're lagging the pace of your inventory drawdown?\nRichard Tobin: No. I think that our channel partners are, in certain cases, below normal holding pattern. And that is because of the cost of carry with interest rates. So if you think about a typical distributor that's got $100 million of inventory, a working capital loan that they would have been able to have 18 months ago was probably 2% or 3%. They're probably paying nine now, right? So there's a dynamic now because of higher interest rates of everybody trying to liquidate working capital because of the cost of that working capital, that\u2019s included, by the way. And we're in a little bit of a standoff in certain end markets where we would argue that inventories are down too low, but we are not going to incentivize revenue into the system either through price or through terms. We're just going to sit tight and we'll cut our own production into Q4 because that's just harvesting demand that's in 2024 into 2023.\nMichael Halloran: So the comment that you made to the previous question about order having a better chance to turn positive in the first quarter, I'm guessing part of it is the comments you just made that inventory flush through the channel essentially normalizes by year-end, and you should have a lease normal throughput, if not a little bit more, given where inventory levels are in certain channels?\nRichard Tobin: That's correct. I mean, if you look at the topline revenue trajectory in some of our businesses, you have to take destocking into it. That's not a reflection of end market demand. It's end market demand minus destocking.\nMichael Halloran: Great. And then on the DPPS side, maybe just kind of parse out the moving pieces there. Obviously, you have the continued destock on the biopharm piece, creating some pretty easy comps in the next year, but a lot of your other pieces are a little bit more IP sensitive. So maybe just talk about some of the moving pieces you're seeing on that side.\nRichard Tobin: Well, I think that overall, it's underestimated, the amount of profit loss that we've had on the biopharma reduction. To the extent that we're clocking at record margins in the quarter, while eating this pretty bad sandwich here, I think that \u2013 quite frankly, I think we're pretty proud of. So to the extent that it's pushed into 2024, at the end of the day, the comps get pretty damn easy once we get into Q1 of next year. The balance of the underlying business, Precision Components, where we basically bought FW Murphy into, look, we're behind energy transition. We're betting on gas in total LNG hydrogen, you name it. Order rates there, we expect to be really good. I think MAAG on plastics and polymers, we've driven down a lot of that backlog. That's probably the one business that's probably going to be weaker next year, but I think it gets completely offset by DPC and by FW Murphy and some amount of bio.\nMichael Halloran: Great. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning guys.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Rich, you've talked about being proactive regarding cost set. But if economic conditions stay somewhat difficult, what kind of opportunities do you have to deliver the kind of margins you just delivered in Q3? And then I think you were fearful at the beginning of the year that pricing in industrials might erode a bit. Have you seen any erosion or do you expect any erosion in your markets? Or would you still expect resilient price cost moving forward?\nRichard Tobin: We're always working on efficiency and structural cost takeout at the end of day. So that's just part and parcel to the business model here. Look, in a dire demand environment, if I point back to how we performed during the COVID period, we\u2019ve got the ability to flex the cost structure, we don't want to, other than kind of productivity and efficiency driven not from a demand point of view. As it relates to pricing, look, I think there was a comment in the script, if you go back and look is that we fundamentally believe that inventory position is going to be incredibly important as it relates to pricing as it goes into 2024. And that's why we're taking a little bit of hard medicine here between now and the end of the year of not to incentivize demand through pricing action, right? We've done a lot of hard work of moving the margins up here, and we're keeping these margins.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Helpful, Rich. And then maybe just a little more color into the puts and takes you're seeing in DCST. You mentioned the slowdown in the heat exchangers, but the strength in CO2 systems, you mentioned as well, and you did deliver strong margin. Do you still see DCST as a growth segment for you in 2024? And how would you assess margin potential from here, given what you just report in Q3?\nRichard Tobin: Look, I think that I think the heat exchanger is temporal, right? I mean, we went through this incredible amount of demand. I don't know if we were clocking up until a month ago, but it was very high demand that we had there. I think this is just a little bit of an inventory clearing thing. So we expect growth out of the heat exchanger business next year. I think that we did our highest margin quarter in refrigeration in the last five years here. We don't think that, that's \u2013 we're going to give back there. Now just recall, though, that Q4, we have to take production down due to seasonality there, all right? So that has some amount of impact on margins. But the trajectory on refrigeration, coupled with CO2, which is margin accretive, we would expect margins to increase there next year. Clearly, we're going to \u2013 that will likely offset the negative input from Belvac, which we expect will run off its backlog next year and have a little bit of a down year in 2024.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate all the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning guys.\nRichard Tobin: Joe.\nJoseph Ritchie: Hey. Just a few quick follow-ups on just the inventory dynamics because, I mean, Rich, you've been doing this a while. It typically \u2013 based on what we've seen, it typically takes longer than a quarter to normalize inventory. And so just any color on your confidence on being able to get inventory where you need it to be by the end of the year? Or is there a good likelihood that some of this kind of spills into 2024?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, when we're talking about total inventory, we're talking about our own inventory, which we're in control of, which is reflected in the cash flow that we're signing up for, right? That takes working capital liquidation, a big chunk of that is inventory. I think if you look at the $600 million of free cash flow during the quarter, a material chunk of that was our own inventory reduction. When we're talking about channel inventory, like I said before, we're \u2013 we've been \u2013 the channel inventory in a lot of our end markets has been coming down progressively over the year. And now we're adopting a posture between now and the end of the year in certain businesses to allow that inventory to clear rather than try to push revenue into either channel inventory or OEM inventory and because the only way you can do that is to start modifying commercial conditions, and we're not doing that. So should it clear, we believe that we're on the front foot here. And so we think we'll be in balance in kind of most of our end markets by the end of the year. And then it just becomes a question of what does growth look like next year and how much confidence there is in the end markets of how much that channel and how quickly they build it back. But we feel good about the trajectory we're on. So that \u2013 it's an end-of-the-year phenomenon based on current demand rates.\nJoseph Ritchie: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just a real quick one on just 4Q in DPPS. So I think you called out flat growth in the segment. So sequentially, revenue is down a little bit. I'm curious just from a margin standpoint, similar revenues \u2013 similar margins for 3Q? How do you think about the margins in 4Q for DPPS?\nRichard Tobin: They're either \u2013 it will be immaterial up or down, right, subject to mix.\nJoseph Ritchie: Okay great. Perfect. Thanks guys.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, good morning. Yes. I just wanted to ask a question on the portfolio. I guess as you consider additional pruning, is there a way to maybe quantify what percent of revenue could be under review? And certainly understand M&A is episodic, but are you seeking to find comparable sized acquisitions to offset? Or how should we think about this portfolio shuffle?\nRichard Tobin: The portfolio \u2013 the whole portfolio is under review all the time. Look, no. Look, we don't go around and say, we've got a business that's got $200 million revenue, let's go buy $100 million to $200 million revenue. No one can orchestrate that. But I think that we've gone over Brett, a lot about where our priorities are. To the extent that we could make a change to our portfolio that we did without touching our balance sheet, I think, is a positive. So to the extent that we could do that repeatedly, that would be great, but that is subject to a lot of timing differences both in and out at the end of the day. But just as an overall comment, what we did this quarter in M&A is what we would like to do progressively every year.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. Makes sense. Just shifting back to heat exchangers and the destock in Europe and Asia. I guess, does this slow the rollout of some of those capacity additions or change the way you\u2019re at least thinking about the near-term from a capacity standpoint? And then what is your level of visibility there in terms of these imbalances that have maybe skewed more negatively here?\nRichard Tobin: No, I think the capacity is coming on sequentially. These are highly automated plants. So it's not like we've got to ramp employees. It's \u2013 they're almost blackout plants at the end of the day. So we needed the standing capacity. Remember, heat exchangers is 40% of the revenue. So I get it, it's getting a lot of headlines, and that's why we wanted to address it. Our visibility is, as I mentioned, is not great because it's an OEM sale mostly for us. So up and to the point where they decide they want to slow down, that's what we find out. And the slowdown that we've been called out for the balance of the year manifested itself over the last 45 days or so. So are we worried about the capacity investment? Absolutely not. We think that the technology is fundamental. It's going to grow over time. There's been a massive amount of capacity in heat pumps that's been announced. It always seems a little bit implausible. So I think at the end of the day, the market reset is going to be on the finished goods, not so much on the consumption of the heat exchangers.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. Appreciate the insight.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. One element I just wanted to circle back to in context of the inventory discussion is around the free cash flow margin guide. So I think that it's very high still for this year, but maybe move down a little bit and that's despite the good progress on the inventory liquidation that you cited in Q3. So maybe just any sort of color around the moving parts inside free cash flow, and it has been very volatile. So any sort of thoughts on maybe next 12 months as it's more sort of normalized?\nRichard Tobin: Well, it's been volatile only because of the amount of demand that it was there. And to meet that demand, you had to basically an expansion of everybody's balance sheet from an inventory point of view. I think that when we put out the guidance for this year, we basically said now that we're in a more normalized market that we were going to bring inventories down. I think we're making really good progress on raw materials. I think by cutting production in Q4, we should clear WIP and finished goods, then it's all about receivables from here to the end of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: I see. And so receivables was kind of the main delta on the change in the free cash margin guide?\nBrad Cerepak: Well, it's part of it. But as we went \u2013 if you go back and look at what our commentary has been over the course of the year, we've indicated it's tough to bring inventories down, but we did that in Q3. We see that continuing into Q4. As we look back, and the actual good performance in Q3, receivables, given the timing of sales, actually built in the quarter a bit. So that liquidation is due to come here in the fourth quarter. And I think we'll see very robust cash flow again, based on the commentary that we already provided that fourth quarter is always seasonally strong. But I think given the actions we're taking, it will be even more robust in line with our guide.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Between cash flow and the proceeds of the disposal, which we'll receive in Q1, we're in a very healthy cash position.\nJulian Mitchell: That makes sense. Thank you. And maybe just to follow-up on the question around the sort of the sales outlook. So I think it's very clear and the right thing to do that you're sort of under selling into the channel, if you like, short-term, to make sure channel partners have low inventories entering the new year. When you sort of take that comment plus the improvement in some orders figures you've seen recently, does that make you sort of confident around the revenue growth outlook despite what the backlog has done? And so we should sort of take the low inventories in the channel plus the orders movement, that's a better determinant of sort of sales into early next year than perhaps what the backlog has been doing recently?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean at the end of the day, everything that's in our control \u2013 for 2024, I think that we're taking the right move. So we discussed managing channel, right, from an inventory point of view. The reason that we highlighted some of the investments, we think that those are growth vectors that those businesses are going to grow despite the macro, right, that they're not subject to kind of general sentiment at the end of the day, or interest rates or anything else just because they've got a demand there. So yes, I mean, look, we're \u2013 knock wood, we're feeling positive about our setup going into 2024 based on how we've managed and will continue to manage 2023.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning, Dan.\nDeane Dray: Hey. I was hoping to get some color on the retail fueling. It just sounds like there was a bit of a disconnect between below-ground and above-ground, below-ground, seem to be fueling effects of higher rates and maybe some destock, but you weren't seeing that above the ground. But just can you square those, please?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. We had \u2013 in 2022, we had a great year in below-ground and a bad year in above-ground. So if you think about kind of the time it takes to build sites or refurbishment sites, you had kind of capacity that got built and then they finished the job on the top this year. Belowground now is in a bit of a headwind because of the fact that if you think about like a retailer, a retailer is going to spec in the product that they want at a fueling site and then going to go contract the installation. And part of the problem is it's no longer labor anymore, and it's no a longer product availability. It's the fact that those contractors need working capital loans in order to do these projects and the cost of those loans now is probably quintupled over the last year or so. It was very nice for everybody would be talking about 5%. 5% is a baseline. You're a contractor, you need a working capital loan, you're paying nine or 10. And so that is putting a little bit of a drag in terms of getting that work done, number one. And number two, just a general comment, as I gave the example before, a lot of that underground business, at least the recurring revenue portion of it is sold through distribution, the carrying cost of that inventory has gone up quite a bit, and you basically see almost an over liquidation of inventory in the chain because they know that our lead times are down low, so they're taking their inventory down because they don't want to pay the carrying cost. At some point, that's got to give, and we're not incentivizing through price or terms to push that inventory back into the system. We'll deal with that on the come when we get into 2024.\nDeane Dray: All right. That's really helpful. And then just a follow-up on the geographies. What were the surprises and maybe you're seeing some of the macro begin to be felt on the U.S. side was down 7%. But what surprised you there?\nRichard Tobin: I think it's more and more \u2013 look, no one came into this year thinking that Europe was going to be robust. It hasn't been. I think that CO2 systems and heat exchangers are running counter to that argument. CO2 is actually performing quite well. The heat exchanger issue, like I said, up until 45 days ago, you couldn't make enough of them to supply heat pump demand and that just came to quite a halt here I think in a recognition that there's too much inventory in the chain. We were not very hopeful about China, and China has been poor. And I think in the U.S., it's just the general \u2013 what I just answered, I gave you the example a second ago. In the U.S., you can't raise rates at the rate we're doing and not to have knock-on effects in terms of the carrying cost and that's what we're seeing now.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So going back to the non-core kind of the portfolio review, I mean, obviously, there's a parlor game about trying to guess which assets might not meet the cuts going forward. But De-Sta-Co wasn't one of those assets. I think already seen as potentially non-core. So I'm just curious given the decent growth, obviously, very good margins, what was it that led that asset to being sold?\nRichard Tobin: I think that the growth was okay, at least in my tenure here. The end market exposure, both from \u2013 the end market exposure and the geographical exposure, we did not find attractive.\nNigel Coe: Too much Europe I assume?\nRichard Tobin: Too much auto and too much Asia.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Too much Asia.\nBrad Cerepak: Too much China, yes.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then just on buybacks, you did an ASR last year. You've got a fair amount of financing flexibility if you get your free cash flow forecast with the sale as well. I mean, any thoughts on buybacks at these levels?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean, look, buying back our stock at these levels has become very attractive. I think that we've got a lot of moving parts right here in terms of delivering on the fourth quarter and the cash flow. And then we've got an outbound on the acquisition and an inbound on the disposal. After all that is settled, we'll clearly be in a very healthy balance sheet position. And I'm sure that capital return discussion will come to the forefront.\nNigel Coe: Okay. I leave it there. Thanks, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. The top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 2%. Both acquisitions and FX translation contributed positive 1% to the topline in the quarter. FX, which has been a headwind for the past year and a half resulted in $0.02 of positive EPS impact in the quarter. Based on recent movement in the euro/dollar exchange rate, we now expect FX to be a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind in the fourth quarter. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market was down 7% in the quarter due to lower shipments in vehicle service, biopharma, LPG components and belowground retail fueling. Europe was down 5% and Asia was down 3%. China, which represents about half of our revenue base in Asia, was down 5% organically in the quarter. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to normalization of lead times and strong shipments against elevated backlogs. Now on our cash flow statement, Slide 8. Year-to-date, free cash flow came in at $688 million or 11% of revenue, represented an increase of nearly $400 million year-over-year. As discussed previously, with supply chains improving, we have begun actively working to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023. We accelerated our inventory reduction in the third quarter and expect the trend to continue as we plan to balance our inventory levels by the end of the year. Free cash flow generation has historically peaked in the fourth quarter. And again, we expect strong fourth quarter cash flow to finish the year. Our forecast for 2023 free cash flow is 13% to 15% of revenue. Let me turn it back to Rich. Yes, Jeff, the things we're seeing here in Q3 and into Q4 on taxes, will not carry into next year. So said differently, I think our 2024 tax rate is going to be much like we saw earlier in this year when we gave guidance, somewhere in that 20% to 22% rate. Well, it's part of it. But as we went \u2013 if you go back and look at what our commentary has been over the course of the year, we've indicated it's tough to bring inventories down, but we did that in Q3. We see that continuing into Q4. As we look back, and the actual good performance in Q3, receivables, given the timing of sales, actually built in the quarter a bit. So that liquidation is due to come here in the fourth quarter. And I think we'll see very robust cash flow again, based on the commentary that we already provided that fourth quarter is always seasonally strong. But I think given the actions we're taking, it will be even more robust in line with our guide. Too much China, yes."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Andrey. We posted very encouraging results [and let us] become a dynamic operating environment across our different end markets and geographies. Revenue and order rates improved sequentially in the quarter on normalizing lead times and inventories, improving demands across several end markets and a return to normal seasonality. Our backlog continued to normalize in the quarter, in tandem with lead times as we shipped longer-dated orders from our books. Broadly speaking, margins performance in the quarter was exceptional, reaching an all-time high driven by productivity, cost controls and disciplined pricing, which more than offset the negative product mix in Pumps & Process Solutions. The proactive structural cost actions we have undertaken over the last 12 months are paying dividends and should support strong margin conversion going forward. Our recent portfolio moves, the acquisition of FW Murphy and the sale of De-Sta-Co followed the portfolio intent and priorities that we reiterated at our Investor Day earlier in the year and continued our portfolio evolution towards higher-growth and higher-return businesses at attractive valuations. Our balance sheet position and cash flow are strong and provide attractive optionality as we continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions in a more favorable M&A environment and evaluate opportunistic capital return strategies. We have reduced our EPS guidance for the full-year and are now targeting the low-end of the previous guidance range. This is driven by continued lag in biopharma recovery that we expected to happen in the second half of the year. Temporary cost and supply chain issues that I'll expand upon later and a general trend towards inventory liquidation across supply chains as a result of macro uncertainty and prohibitive carrying costs, I'll cover the specifics in the segment commentary. Overall, demand remains good across the portfolio, considering the plentiful negative macro headlines. Our new product launches and capacity additions and identified areas of growth are all on track, and we expect that our fourth quarter production posture will help balance our channel inventories with prevailing demand, lead times and inventory carrying costs by the end of 2023. We are increasingly convinced that inventory position will be critical to the pricing dynamic and financial results moving into 2024. Going into 2024, we expect to see growth in our bookings driven by secular growth exposed in recovering end markets, and we expect to carry an elevated backlog into next year in select businesses. Between our demand outlook, flexible business model and in-flight structural cost actions, we see good foundation for value creation in 2024. Let's move on to the performance highlights on Page 4. Consolidated revenue was down 2% in the quarter despite sequential growth in four out of five segments. Bookings were up sequentially, but down 4% organically year-over-year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.93, reflecting better lead times and strong shipments against our longer-dated orders. As a result, our backlog continued to normalize, but remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Segment margins were up 50 basis points to 21.7%, a record since the Apergy spin as broadly based productivity and portfolio improvements were more than able to offset biopharma mix. Adjusted EPS was up 4% to $2.35 in the quarter. And positive price/cost dynamics, together with cost containment actions, strong execution, more than offset lower volumes. Let's go to Slide 5. Engineered Products was down 3% organically in the quarter. General weakness in Europe and Asia, together with lower shipments in vehicle service, more than offset the record quarter in aerospace and defense and strong shipments in waste hauling. Order rates in the segment were up 12% organically in the quarter, primarily driven by waste handling business, which continues to take capacity reservations well into 2024. Margins at 20% were up 260 basis points year-over-year driven by a better mix of recurring and aftermarket revenue, price/cost and productivity investments made in previous periods. I'd like to mention the announcement of our agreement to divest De-Sta-Co, one of the operating units within the Engineered Products segments and an attractive valuation. This is not related to [indiscernible] performance, but we leave the valuation we achieved underscores the quality and strong performance of the businesses that we have proven to have best-in-class operating margin and less cyclicality than typical capital goods businesses. Clean Energy & Fueling revenue was flat organically in the quarter. We saw double-digit growth in components for LNG and hydrogen markets. And the aboveground retail fueling business returned to growth as post-EMV recovery is in progress. High interest rates led to project push-outs in vehicle wash and an unforecasted channel destocking has resulted in slower activity in LPG components and belowground fueling, which are highly margin accretive to the segment. Margins in the quarter were at 20%, were up 40 basis points on structural cost actions in our retail fueling business and solid execution more than offset negative mix.  Imaging & ID was down 4% organically as slowing demand in China and a difficult comparable period in marking and coding printer shipments more than offset the growth in serialization software and marking and coding consumables and professional services. Margins in Imaging & ID was strong at 26%, though down year-over-year against an all-time record high for the segment in the comparable quarter. Pumps & Process Solutions was down 7% organically in the quarter. Precision components and hygienic dosing systems posted another quarter of excellent growth, but were more than offset by the continued softness in biopharma. Industrial pumps and polymer processing [were stable] in the quarter. Segment margin of 27% was down to the lower mix of biopharma revenue. Topline in Climate & Sustainability Technologies was up 2% organically. CO2 systems continued its double-digit growth trajectory. Heat exchanger shipments remained strong in North America and Europe, though we experienced the beginning of demand headwinds in Asia. The segment posted strong margin performance of 18% in the quarter with our food retail business or refrigeration business operating at a robust 15% margin. The steady margin improvement trajectory in refrigeration has been noteworthy as positive mix and productivity investments have driven excellent margin conversion. We expect the margin improvement trend to continue for the whole segment. I'll pass it on to Brad here. All right. I'm on Slide 9. We expect Engineered Products to generate moderate growth in the fourth quarter. Aerospace and defense should remain strong. Meanwhile, the auto strike will weigh on several businesses in the near-term. Growth in our waste handling business, which is expected to be robust in the fourth quarter into 2024 will be reduced in the near-term by recent strike at a major truck OEM impacting deliveries. Shipments in vehicle aftermarket expected to be lower versus a record previous year on higher interest rates weigh on service shop's ability to finance CapEx. We expect margins to improve in the quarter on positive price/cost tailwinds and benefits from our recent productivity capital investments. Clean Energy & Fueling is expected to remain steady. Clean energy, LNG and hydrogen components should continue their robust trajectory and order trends in aboveground retail fueling point to continued post-EMV recovery. We expect channel destocking and interest rate-driven headwinds in the belowground fueling segment, LPG components and vehicle wash to maintain through year-end. We expect stable margin performance as the $60 million in aggregate structural cost containment actions in retail fueling should offset negative mix from lower belowground and lower car wash volumes. Imaging & ID is expected to be down organically against a difficult comparable period driven by slowing demand in Asia and a subdued outlook for textiles. Serialization software should continue its growth trajectory. Our new customer conversion margin performance should remain at attractive levels at this segment. Pumps & Process is expected to remain roughly flat organically in the fourth quarter. Precision components should continue growth tailwinds from energy transition projects. Polymer processing is booked for the year. The recovery in biopharma components has been very subdued. And although channel inventory levels are now below pre-pandemic levels, end customer demand has not recovered enough to drive 2023 growth despite earlier forecast indicating recovery. We have reduced our production and inventory levels appropriately and will remain in this posture for the balance of the year. This is generally a short-cycle business, and we can ramp as order rates recover in 2024. We expect year-over-year margin headwinds on negative mix in biopharma. And after several years of impressive topline growth, Climate & Sustainability Technologies is expect to moderate in the fourth quarter as demand for heat exchangers abruptly slowed in Q3 due to near-term uncertainty in European heat pumps. As a result, we are reducing production levels to allow for inventory to be cleared in the fourth quarter. Traditional refrigeration demand will retain its seasonality with reduced activity during the holiday season. But we continue to see robust demand for our CO2 refrigeration systems and are ramping up production and go-to-market efforts appropriately. We expect continued year-over-year margin improvement through year-end on productivity gains and improved mix. Going to Slide 10. Our updated EPS guide reflects the near-term changes in demand and our production posture, temporary and isolated issues in the supply chain and costs related to acquisitions, integration and divestment activities. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in Q4 as a result of tax reorganization activities driven by upcoming regulatory changes. As I've highlighted, we believe our changed operating and production posture focused on reducing inventories and prioritizing cash flow over volume in reaction to the dynamic operating environment is critical to setting up 2024 outlook where we can maintain and expand operating margins. Let's go to Slide 11 and take a quick look at the inorganic moves that we made during the quarter. Here, we summarized the two recently announced transaction that align well with our portfolio priorities and enhance the overall quality of Dover's portfolio through margin growth and reoccurring revenue uplift, all while reducing our exposure to automotive and China. Importantly, we are able to acquire FW Murphy, a lower valuation multiple than our sale of De-Sta-Co and the after-tax proceeds from the De-Sta-Co sale more than pay for FW Murphy, preserving significant balance sheet capacity for additional capital deployment options. Slide 12 provides more color on the rationale for the acquisition of FW Murphy by our precision components operating unit, which is part of Pumps & Process Solutions segment. FW Murphy brings a highly complementary product offering to our existing position in reciprocating compression industry. FW Murphy Solutions capitalized on the growing adoption of advanced remote monitoring, control real-time optimization solutions as customers seek to reduce costs, improve uptime and lower emissions. In combination with our best-in-class clean technology and our leading position in sealing and valve technology for alternative energy applications, including in hydrogen, the FW Murphy acquisition offers a compelling value proposition into a global industry where we see robust demand from energy transition investments. The FW Murphy acquisition provides a good segue into our next topic, which is to highlight, the recent developments in investment in sustainability-driven markets, starting on Slide 13. There has been plenty of interest around hydrogen as a result of the recent announcement of $7 billion in federal funding for multiple regional hydrogen hubs that are expected to also attract $40 billion in private funding and a roster of blue chip industry participants. Dover has established a position in hydrogen with the 2021 acquisition of Acme, which supplies flow control components for liquid hydrogen and [indiscernible], which offers turnkey hydrogen refueling sites. Additionally, we are organically invested in extending DPCs gas compression components to participate in gaseous hydrogen applications. In short, there is no hydrogen economy without compression. We have great relationships with the industrial gas and hydrogen players and aim to participate throughout the whole value chain through transport and storage through end-use in collaboration with equipment OEMs. We are well positioned to capitalize on growth in hydrogen and industry with a high focus on safety and regulatory compliance with high technological requirements for participation. Moving to Slide 14. The EPA recently finalized its rule under the AIM Act with a deadline for new installation of refrigeration systems to be compliant with lower GWP requirements by January of 2027. We believe this rule is a clear tailwind to our CO2 systems business. And we have had a leading position in the European CO2 market for over a decade where we enjoyed steady double-digit growth trajectory. We were the early mover in transplanting this technology to the U.S. where we currently enjoy technological lead and have the largest installed based and broadest differentiated offering. We have proactively expanded our capacity in addition and in participation of market growth and have been investing behind a platform-based product strategy to drive standardization, thereby reducing costs for ourselves and our customers, improving product quality and simplifying the sales process. Our global CO2 business is approximately $200 million in revenue. The U.S. market is in the early innings, and our business is on track for 30% growth in 2023 with a strong outlook. We are also excited about our new CO2-based heat pump offerings for industrial and district heating applications. It's early days, but we have an active pipeline of orders. And finally, on Slide 15 shows our latest views on heat exchangers since it has become a battleground topic. Our heat exchanger business supplies brazed plate technology, which is currently the most sustainable commercialized heat transfer technology for fluids. We have been the clear beneficiary of the sustainability and climate tailwinds across various applications with a lot of attention drawn recently from our participation as a key supplier to hydronic heat pumps. Heat pumps have emerged in recent years as a technology of choice to decarbonize residential heating, which is responsible for a significant portion of global emissions with hydronic heat pumps as a primary technology to retrofit houses that rely on water-based heating. Legislative initiatives in European Union and individual countries are driving the conversion of fossil fuel boiler with heat pumps. Recent uncertainties about subsidies in select European countries have weighed on near-term volumes, as I indicated earlier. Our exposure across multiple OEMs and geographies, and as such, we are not over-indexed to any product or customer concentration risk. We remain confident about the long-term growth prospects for heat pumps and our technology. It is important to note that European residential heat pumps represent only a quarter of our heat exchanger business. You see several solid growth vectors driven by sustainability tailwinds and continue to share gains from other legacy heat exchanger technologies. We have proactively expanded our capacity as we expect continued robust growth trajectory in heat exchangers, albeit with slightly lower rates in the near-term as various dynamics in Europe slow down. I close my prepared remarks by thanking our global teams for driving our strong financial performance during the quarter. And it's time for Q&A. Hi, Steve. Okay. That's a lot to take on this. Steve, let's give it a try. Look, I think if we look at our forecast for the year, we were just wrong about biopharma. I mean, we were getting indications from our customers that there was going to be some nascent recovery. We actually did see some order upticks, but quite frankly, it just never turned into much. So that's a little bit different than we were back in September. I think we just have to throw in the towel on biopharma demand and it gets pushed to 2024. We didn't expect in terms of market dynamics was this UAW on trucks, right? We thought it would stay limited into the car sector. And unfortunately, what we were betting on is being able to ship quite heavily out of ESG in Q4. We'll actually have a good quarter in Q4, but it's not going to be as robust in our plans. I think I mentioned on the heat exchangers. That was a little bit of an abrupt reversal and really didn't happen until almost the end of Q3. So up until about 30 days ago. Everything looked good there. And I think that we've got a little bit of a pivot as what we understand is there's a lot of finished goods in the supply chain that need to be reduced from there. So at the end of the day, I think it slowed some and \u2013 which leads into the next question. And the next question, our positioning now is to drive for cash because I think that the way we're going to be able to protect margins into 2024 is not to be long inventory. We had a lot of discussions around here about incentivizing revenue in 2024 driving revenue, but then you start touching on things like price and you start touching on things like payment terms, and we're not going there. I mean I think that the strategy that we have is to adapt quickly and efficiently to the market demand, bring down our inventory with the hope of \u2013 with the strategy of protecting margin into next year. And I think if you look at how we've handled demand this year, it's exactly what we've done at the end of the day. I mean, we talked about it before. What we had seen over the previous two years was not a lot of unitary demand. You saw a lot of pricing going into the system. So we came into this year saying, there's probably going to be less price and some unitary demand, but the important \u2013 and I think that we've done that in terms of managing, which is reflected in our margins year-to-date, is managing not getting oversupply and over our SKUs a little bit in terms of inventory and that we're going to take that on for next year. Do you want me to make a call on the market next year? I think we're going to have to wait on that. Clearly, there's a lot of headwinds in the system. I don't want to get on a personal soapbox, but the amount of liquidity that's being withdrawn is going to show up somewhere. And this notion that we're all going to wait on the government to bail us out because of this wave of government spending coming, I find that a problematic strategy. So I think it all is going to be triggered by monetary policy between now and the end of the year, which is going to allow for us to predict growth into next year. What I can tell you is, is if we do what we're planning on doing in Q4, we will not be long inventory, and we're not going to get into a situation where if there are kind of topline headwinds that we're going to have to start playing price to drive growth. No, I don't think so. I think that we're ahead of the curve. Remember, we're a component supplier into end market industries, right? So we're first at the end of the day. So I think that if we get this right, we've got topline growth next year, even in a pretty benign kind of macro environment, I think that we can drive growth. And I think that's part of the reason that we covered some of those growth vectors in terms of our investment at the end of the presentation. Thanks. Sure. I think if you go back and look at the script, basically, what it says is the restructuring that we took is going to protect margins into Q4 because we actually have a poor mix forecasted for Q4 because where we've been seeing the headwinds in Fueling Solutions is in the below-ground portion of the segment, and that is highly accretive to margins. We're basically \u2013 you heard me answer Steve's question there, we're taking the position of let's allow inventory to be draw down even we would argue at this point, below even normal levels between now and the end of the year and protect production performance into next year. So the restructuring benefit \u2013 the restructuring that we've done is actually protecting margins into Q4. Yes. I think we're getting a lot better at it. At the end of the day, where we sell through distribution, we have visibility, right, because we've just got a material position within distribution, so we can see pretty much stocking levels. At the OEM level, it becomes a lot more difficult. At the end of the day, we're relying on the OEMs to basically tell us their own position. So let's take heat exchangers. Up until 45 days ago, it was still a demand capacity deficit of give us everything you've got and then all of a sudden, for reasons that I tried to cover, the markets come to a halt because there's a recognition of the seemingly is a lot of finished goods in the chain now that need to be bled off. So like I said, from \u2013 if it's distribution, I think that we've got a pretty good handle on it. When it's OEM, we just got to take the signals from them. I don't think that we have excess backlog anymore. I mean, I think that we're \u2013 by the end of the year, we will have drawn down our longer cycle backlog, particularly in Belvac and MAAG, which drove a lot of it. I think it will end up being a little bit higher than kind of on average in terms of its aggregate, if you go back and look over the last five years, but that is more related to portfolio \u2013 general portfolio mix as opposed to anything else. So like I said, at the end of the year, we think that we'll be in balance between our inventory and our \u2013 either the customer distribution inventory, I would expect the long-cycle business backlogs to be done that reduction to be done by the end of the year. I got to go back and take a look. I mean, I would say flat. If I think about where bookings are coming from, we got a lot in ESG at high dollar value because quite frankly, we're booking well into 2024 in that particular business just because of supply constraints. Flat, I would call it right now. I think that there's an overall caution with the macro \u2013 everybody recognizes that lead times have been vastly reduced. So I think that there's going to be a lot of hurry for bookings in Q4, but we would expect a pretty large acceleration in Q1, if we've got. Welcome. No. I think that our channel partners are, in certain cases, below normal holding pattern. And that is because of the cost of carry with interest rates. So if you think about a typical distributor that's got $100 million of inventory, a working capital loan that they would have been able to have 18 months ago was probably 2% or 3%. They're probably paying nine now, right? So there's a dynamic now because of higher interest rates of everybody trying to liquidate working capital because of the cost of that working capital, that's included, by the way. And we're in a little bit of a standoff in certain end markets where we would argue that inventories are down too low, but we are not going to incentivize revenue into the system either through price or through terms. We're just going to sit tight and we'll cut our own production into Q4 because that's just harvesting demand that's in 2024 into 2023. That's correct. I mean, if you look at the topline revenue trajectory in some of our businesses, you have to take destocking into it. That's not a reflection of end market demand. It's end market demand minus destocking. Well, I think that overall, it's underestimated, the amount of profit loss that we've had on the biopharma reduction. To the extent that we're clocking at record margins in the quarter, while eating this pretty bad sandwich here, I think that \u2013 quite frankly, I think we're pretty proud of. So to the extent that it's pushed into 2024, at the end of the day, the comps get pretty damn easy once we get into Q1 of next year. The balance of the underlying business, Precision Components, where we basically bought FW Murphy into, look, we're behind energy transition. We're betting on gas in total LNG hydrogen, you name it. Order rates there, we expect to be really good. I think MAAG on plastics and polymers, we've driven down a lot of that backlog. That's probably the one business that's probably going to be weaker next year, but I think it gets completely offset by DPC and by FW Murphy and some amount of bio. Good morning. We're always working on efficiency and structural cost takeout at the end of day. So that's just part and parcel to the business model here. Look, in a dire demand environment, if I point back to how we performed during the COVID period, we've got the ability to flex the cost structure, we don't want to, other than kind of productivity and efficiency driven not from a demand point of view. As it relates to pricing, look, I think there was a comment in the script, if you go back and look is that we fundamentally believe that inventory position is going to be incredibly important as it relates to pricing as it goes into 2024. And that's why we're taking a little bit of hard medicine here between now and the end of the year of not to incentivize demand through pricing action, right? We've done a lot of hard work of moving the margins up here, and we're keeping these margins. Look, I think that I think the heat exchanger is temporal, right? I mean, we went through this incredible amount of demand. I don't know if we were clocking up until a month ago, but it was very high demand that we had there. I think this is just a little bit of an inventory clearing thing. So we expect growth out of the heat exchanger business next year. I think that we did our highest margin quarter in refrigeration in the last five years here. We don't think that, that's \u2013 we're going to give back there. Now just recall, though, that Q4, we have to take production down due to seasonality there, all right? So that has some amount of impact on margins. But the trajectory on refrigeration, coupled with CO2, which is margin accretive, we would expect margins to increase there next year. Clearly, we're going to \u2013 that will likely offset the negative input from Belvac, which we expect will run off its backlog next year and have a little bit of a down year in 2024. Joe. Well, I mean, when we're talking about total inventory, we're talking about our own inventory, which we're in control of, which is reflected in the cash flow that we're signing up for, right? That takes working capital liquidation, a big chunk of that is inventory. I think if you look at the $600 million of free cash flow during the quarter, a material chunk of that was our own inventory reduction. When we're talking about channel inventory, like I said before, we're \u2013 we've been \u2013 the channel inventory in a lot of our end markets has been coming down progressively over the year. And now we're adopting a posture between now and the end of the year in certain businesses to allow that inventory to clear rather than try to push revenue into either channel inventory or OEM inventory and because the only way you can do that is to start modifying commercial conditions, and we're not doing that. So should it clear, we believe that we're on the front foot here. And so we think we'll be in balance in kind of most of our end markets by the end of the year. And then it just becomes a question of what does growth look like next year and how much confidence there is in the end markets of how much that channel and how quickly they build it back. But we feel good about the trajectory we're on. So that \u2013 it's an end-of-the-year phenomenon based on current demand rates. They're either \u2013 it will be immaterial up or down, right, subject to mix. Thanks. The portfolio \u2013 the whole portfolio is under review all the time. Look, no. Look, we don't go around and say, we've got a business that's got $200 million revenue, let's go buy $100 million to $200 million revenue. No one can orchestrate that. But I think that we've gone over Brett, a lot about where our priorities are. To the extent that we could make a change to our portfolio that we did without touching our balance sheet, I think, is a positive. So to the extent that we could do that repeatedly, that would be great, but that is subject to a lot of timing differences both in and out at the end of the day. But just as an overall comment, what we did this quarter in M&A is what we would like to do progressively every year. No, I think the capacity is coming on sequentially. These are highly automated plants. So it's not like we've got to ramp employees. It's \u2013 they're almost blackout plants at the end of the day. So we needed the standing capacity. Remember, heat exchangers is 40% of the revenue. So I get it, it's getting a lot of headlines, and that's why we wanted to address it. Our visibility is, as I mentioned, is not great because it's an OEM sale mostly for us. So up and to the point where they decide they want to slow down, that's what we find out. And the slowdown that we've been called out for the balance of the year manifested itself over the last 45 days or so. So are we worried about the capacity investment? Absolutely not. We think that the technology is fundamental. It's going to grow over time. There's been a massive amount of capacity in heat pumps that's been announced. It always seems a little bit implausible. So I think at the end of the day, the market reset is going to be on the finished goods, not so much on the consumption of the heat exchangers. Thanks. Well, it's been volatile only because of the amount of demand that it was there. And to meet that demand, you had to basically an expansion of everybody's balance sheet from an inventory point of view. I think that when we put out the guidance for this year, we basically said now that we're in a more normalized market that we were going to bring inventories down. I think we're making really good progress on raw materials. I think by cutting production in Q4, we should clear WIP and finished goods, then it's all about receivables from here to the end of the year. Yes. Between cash flow and the proceeds of the disposal, which we'll receive in Q1, we're in a very healthy cash position. Yes. I mean at the end of the day, everything that's in our control \u2013 for 2024, I think that we're taking the right move. So we discussed managing channel, right, from an inventory point of view. The reason that we highlighted some of the investments, we think that those are growth vectors that those businesses are going to grow despite the macro, right, that they're not subject to kind of general sentiment at the end of the day, or interest rates or anything else just because they've got a demand there. So yes, I mean, look, we're \u2013 knock wood, we're feeling positive about our setup going into 2024 based on how we've managed and will continue to manage 2023. Thanks. Good morning, Dan. Sure. We had \u2013 in 2022, we had a great year in below-ground and a bad year in above-ground. So if you think about kind of the time it takes to build sites or refurbishment sites, you had kind of capacity that got built and then they finished the job on the top this year. Belowground now is in a bit of a headwind because of the fact that if you think about like a retailer, a retailer is going to spec in the product that they want at a fueling site and then going to go contract the installation. And part of the problem is it's no longer labor anymore, and it's no a longer product availability. It's the fact that those contractors need working capital loans in order to do these projects and the cost of those loans now is probably quintupled over the last year or so. It was very nice for everybody would be talking about 5%. 5% is a baseline. You're a contractor, you need a working capital loan, you're paying nine or 10. And so that is putting a little bit of a drag in terms of getting that work done, number one. And number two, just a general comment, as I gave the example before, a lot of that underground business, at least the recurring revenue portion of it is sold through distribution, the carrying cost of that inventory has gone up quite a bit, and you basically see almost an over liquidation of inventory in the chain because they know that our lead times are down low, so they're taking their inventory down because they don't want to pay the carrying cost. At some point, that's got to give, and we're not incentivizing through price or terms to push that inventory back into the system. We'll deal with that on the come when we get into 2024. I think it's more and more \u2013 look, no one came into this year thinking that Europe was going to be robust. It hasn't been. I think that CO2 systems and heat exchangers are running counter to that argument. CO2 is actually performing quite well. The heat exchanger issue, like I said, up until 45 days ago, you couldn't make enough of them to supply heat pump demand and that just came to quite a halt here I think in a recognition that there's too much inventory in the chain. We were not very hopeful about China, and China has been poor. And I think in the U.S., it's just the general \u2013 what I just answered, I gave you the example a second ago. In the U.S., you can't raise rates at the rate we're doing and not to have knock-on effects in terms of the carrying cost and that's what we're seeing now. I think that the growth was okay, at least in my tenure here. The end market exposure, both from \u2013 the end market exposure and the geographical exposure, we did not find attractive. Too much auto and too much Asia. Yes. I mean, look, buying back our stock at these levels has become very attractive. I think that we've got a lot of moving parts right here in terms of delivering on the fourth quarter and the cash flow. And then we've got an outbound on the acquisition and an inbound on the disposal. After all that is settled, we'll clearly be in a very healthy balance sheet position. And I'm sure that capital return discussion will come to the forefront. Thanks."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir.\nJack Dickens: Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through August 15, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Jack. Let's start on Slide 3. Our results are in line with our internal forecast in the second quarter. Our secular growth exposed businesses that we highlighted at our recent Investor Day outperformed in the quarter with heat exchangers, natural refrigerant systems and polymer processing, all posting growth in excess of 20%.  During the quarter, we incurred operational headwinds from our vehicle service group main production facility as a result of an ERP implementation, which cost us approximately $50 million in revenue and approximately $0.10 of EPS. This one's on me. The business has been doing an excellent job on efficiency actions related to fixed costs, SKU management and vertical integration over the past 18 months, which has been reflected in the margin performance conducting a much-needed ERP upgrade, which is fundamental to our e-commerce ambitions, while finishing a large CapEx project was in retrospect overly ambitious. And I guess I should have known better.  We exited June -- the good news, we exited June with far improved production performance at the site, and we'll try our best to claw back the lost volumes in the second half. We have a constructive outlook for the second half of the year and are narrowing our annual EPS guidance to $8.85 to $9. Since the start of the year, we expected 2023 performance to be weighted to the second half due to post-pandemic destocking across the industrial economy and the gradual recovery in several of our end markets, with the seasonality of second half earnings consistent with what we saw in the pre-pandemic years.  Underlying demand remains good across the portfolio and a significant volume of business is already in the backlog. We proactively intervened on our cost structure starting in the latter half of 2022. And we have continued these structural cost reductions in 2023, driving material earnings benefits. As a result, we are less reliant on top line volume or price cost to achieve our forecast in the second half.  With our solid demand outlook, flexible business model and execution playbook, we are confident in delivering our second half target. We also see a solid foundation building for 2024. A large portion of our portfolio has experienced secular -- or cyclical momentum growth exposures that should persist in a variety of macro conditions and we are proactively adding capacity to ensure we continue to win in these markets.  We also expect solid carryover benefits into 2024 from previously announced cost reduction actions. These organic initiatives, together with a strong acquisition pipeline and meaningful cash flow generation will keep us on track to achieve our long-term growth and value creation goals we set forth in our Investor Day in March.  Let's go to Slide 4. Consolidated organic revenue was down 3% in the quarter despite growth in 3 of the 5 segments due to expected comparable volume declines in several end markets and the aforementioned shipment disruptions in vehicle market, which cost us 2% to the top line. Organic bookings were down 8%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92, reflecting better lead times across the portfolio and continued strong shipments against backlogs in our longer cycle and secular growth exposed businesses.  As a result, our backlog continues to normalize, but still remains elevated relative to the pandemic levels. Segment margin was 20.2%, with margin performance preserved despite negative mix and lower volumes due to proactive cost containment actions and lower input costs. We expect the roll forward of these actions together with more normal demand seasonality to drive sequential and comparable operating margin improvement in the second half.  Let's skip to Slide 5, and we'll go through some detailed results on the quarter. Engineered Products was down 8% organically in the quarter. The waste handling business posted a particularly strong quarter, improving chassis availability and aftermarket attachment rates driving solid growth in volumes and new orders. We are presently taking capacity reservations for 2024 and we will be ramping production to meet demand progressively over the balance of the year.  Margins were down 50 basis points year-over-year, principally driven by lower volumes in vehicle aftermarket which offset the robust margin improvement in waste handling. Clean energy and fueling declined 9% on an organic basis as the final quarter of comps impacted the top line and margin mix.  Vehicle wash and clean energy were down slightly in the quarter as distribution inventories were brought down in line with the increased cost to carry on higher interest rates. Channel checks indicate that we are now at appropriate levels for expected second half demand.  Margins in the quarter were down 100 basis points on lower volumes and mix, but partially offset by significant cost reduction actions taken in the retail fueling business as we pivot this business to margin and cash flow maximization. Imaging and ID was flat organically on solid growth in our core marketing coating business in Europe and the Americas as well as strong sales in software, serialization. Shipments in Asia were lower. FX remained a negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in this segment given its large base of non-U.S. dollar revenue.  Margins in Imaging and ID was strong at 23% and improving 40 basis points on pricing and cost controls. Pumps and process was up 1% organically in the quarter, with particular strength in polymer processing equipment, precision components, thermal connectors and hygienic dosing systems. Volumes in industrial pumps was softer due to channel inventory reductions. Operating margin was down due to lower mix of biopharma.  Top line in climate and sustainability technologies were about 4% organically, demand trends remain robust in heat exchanges and CO2 refrigeration systems driven by global investments in sustainability. The segment posted a strong 7% margin in the quarter, up 210 basis points year-over-year on strong volume conversion productivity and positive price cost and mix of products delivered. I'll pass it to Brad from here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm now on Slide 7. The top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 3%, driven by declines in Engineered Products and Clean Energy & Fueling. Acquisitions contributed 1% to the top line in the quarter, and FX translation was a 1% headwind.  FX headwinds resulted in $0.02 negative EPS impact in the quarter and $0.09 in the first half. Based on year-over-year exchange rates, we expect FX to be an $0.08 tailwind to EPS in the second half of the year. From a geo perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was down 9% in the quarter due to expected lower volumes in the aboveground retail fueling segment as well as lower shipments from vehicle services in North America.  Europe was down 1% and Asia was up 2%. China, which represent about half of our revenue base in Asia was up 5% organically in the quarter. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to normalizing lead times in our shorter-cycle businesses and strong shipments against elevated backlogs in our long cycle and secular growth exposed businesses.  Now on to Slide 8, our cash flow statement. Year-to-date, free cash flow came in at $348 million or 8% of revenue and represents an increase of nearly $250 million year-over-year. As discussed previously, with supply chains improving, we have been actively working to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023. We expect that trend to play out in the second half of the year as higher shipment volumes in the third and fourth quarter should result in a reduction of inventory balances between now and the end of the year. This trend is in line with our normal seasonal pattern, as cash flow generation has historically improved in the second half of the year.  Our forecast for free cash flow remains on track for between 15% and 17% of revenue. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: All right. Let's go to Slide 9. Here, we show the growth in margin outlook by segment for 2023 that are underpinned in our current time log trends. Our backlog remains elevated across all segments driven primarily by extended backlogs in our longer cycle and secular growth exposed businesses as our lead times continue to normalize and new capacity comes online, we expect these backlogs to continue normalizing through the end of the year.  We expect Engineered products to return to growth in the second half of the year, driven by continued strength in refuse collection vehicles in aerospace and defense. Our waste handling business is fully booked for the year with the possible upside of chassis availability further improves. We expect vehicle aftermarket shipments in North America to recover after the temporary disruption in Q2 and the business should remain relatively stable year-over-year in the back half.  We expect margins to improve in the second half on positive price/cost tailwinds, solid volumes and benefits from our recent productivity capital investments taking hold. In Clean Energy & Fueling, it's expected to return to growth in the second half of the year against easier comparable periods as the end market conditions and channel inventories normalize.  Quoting activity for hydrogen infrastructure components remains robust, and we are working to expand capacity for select products, including vacuum jacketed piping in cryogenic valves. We expect full year margin improvement in Clean Energy & Fueling driven by stronger performance in the second half on volume recovery, improved mix and continued proactive restructuring savings in retail fueling.  Since initiating our fundamental transformation of the retail fueling cost structure last fall, we have initiated or announced $60 million of structural cost reductions in this business. Imaging and ID is expected to continue its stable performance, albeit against tougher comps in the second half, driven by stable outlook in core marketing and coding and serialization. Software full year margins should remain at attractive levels for this segment.  Pumps and process equipment is expected to remain roughly flat organically in the second half. Thermal connectors continued to grow at a double-digit clip with some notable customer wins. Following a record Q2 Precision Components continues to book and ship at robust levels and with a notable mix in business towards energy transition markets, polymer processing is booked for the year.  The biopharma environment is improving with market conditions such as FDA approvals for new promising therapies and recovery in biotech funding and inventory stocking all showing improvement as indicated by our customers who have released results over the past few days. We expect margins in this segment to remain best-in-class levels with performance skewed towards the end of the year on stronger volumes and mix improvements. Order rates and biopharma will be the watch item from here with the potential recovery -- with the potential for this recovery to be a material tailwind into 2024.  Climate and Sustainability Technologies top line trajectory is expected to be steady in the second half of the year. We are operating close to capacity in heat exchanges for heat pumps with incremental capacity coming online over the next several quarters with direct labor at less than 10% of revenue, the conversion on growth in heat exchanges is compelling.  Demand for CO2 refrigeration systems remain solid, and our capacity build-out is on schedule. We are starting to have productive conversations for our door case business with large retailers for their 2024 plans, which is an encouraging indicator of future demand. Beverage can-making is expected to be down as the industry is digesting recent record capacity additions.  We expect continued margin improvement in 2023 on volume conversion, productivity gains and improved mix. Our margin performance in refrigeration has been very encouraging even before the material accretive impact of North American CO2 volume.  Let's go to Slide 10. Here is the confidence we have in the underlying components that drive our forecasted double-digit EPS growth in the second half. We have been vocal about the negative impact of interest costs on channel inventories and have been encouraged that to draw down, while a headwind to the first half revenue has been orderly as end market demand is largely held up.  Recognizing that our markets are not immune to these dynamics, we have proactively enacted cost containment actions to derisk the second half of the year and also provide $40 million of incremental carryover cost savings into 2024 with roughly half the savings coming from retail fueling as part of our strategy to pivot to margin and cash flow maximization of this business. We believe our growth and conversion forecast is achieved based on our revenue visibility and backlog, channel inventory stabilization, secular growth tailwinds and recovery in end markets.  So let's go to Slide 11. We view 2023 as a transition year for our business from a supply chain constrained inflationary high-demand environment of 21 to 22 to a more normalized activity supported by various macro trends. As we move to the second half of the year, the majority of the destocking headwinds behind us and recovery across several end markets we are building solid momentum for 2024.  We are investing meaningfully behind our secular growth exposed end markets to ensure we have sufficient capacity to serve our customers. We are proactively engaging in new product development, often in co-development with our OEM partners to drive product improvement they win share in the marketplace. We believe our biopharma and retail fueling dispenser visits, which were in face with expected market-driven headwinds in 2023, are poised for strong margin accretive recoveries in 2024.  All in, we believe at least 40% of our portfolio is experiencing tailwinds that are decoupled from broader industrial production with additional pockets of growth in our market-leading niche industrial franchises. This growth outlook together, the carryover benefit of cost actions into '24, set up a solid foundation for our growth prospects in line with our financial commitments from our Investor Day in March.  So let's move to Slide 12. With our supply chains and operational environment normalizing our forecast for 2023 embedded in a return to pre-pandemic seasonality, the year has played out more or less as we expected thus far with more challenging half of the year now in the rearview mirror. The path from here is straightforward. Underlying demand is solid across our business, and we are confident in our ability to leverage a flexible operating model centralized business systems to drive consolidated growth and margin accretion to achieve our full year guidance.  Our inorganic pipeline remains robust. We remain committed to optimizing our business portfolio and evaluating some interesting options, which we hope to conclude in the second half of the year. That's it for me. I'll turn it back to you, Jack.\nJack Dickens: Shelby, you can go to the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question on sort of negative bookings, right, and revenue decline, generally, this destock takes more than 1 quarter, and I appreciate that you do have visibility, but I think versus our model, we were a bit surprised by the revenue. So what gives you confidence that this connection between bookings and destock that this is a 1-quarter event and does not sort of cascade into Q3?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I think you have to delink the comments we made about destocking from bookings to a certain extent. So I mean, the bookings number is related to the reduction in the backlog as the backlog slowly deflates and we expect that to continue some. So I wouldn't -- I think we've been pretty vocal about that all year. I think that what has changed in the first half of the year is the realization that the carrying cost of inventory in the channel has gone up exponentially, right?  So if you go take a look at the cost of financing inventory at a distribution level, gone up by 600 or 700 basis points. So I don't think it's unique when a company like Dover says moving into this year that we're going to run for cash and deplete our inventories. I think by and large, everybody was poised to do that. I think that what was underestimated was the short-term negative headwind on the cost to carry.  By doing the -- where we've seen that and where we've done channel checks, we believe that the vast majority of that reduction on the cost to carry is behind us. So we don't have that negative headwind going in the second half of the year, but I wouldn't get all caught up on the bookings side because the bookings are going to be reflective of the backlog decreasing, and I think that they're likely to inflect positive likely in Q4.\nAndrew Obin: And just maybe looking and follow-up on pumps and process. Can we just go and be getting a lot of questions on that just by verticals, just a little bit more visibility on bookings and revenue visibility into the second half because it is a big focus for investors, particularly the timing of biopharma recovery.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Well, I mean, I think that if you go back and read the transcript, I called out that the watch item from here is going to be bookings in biopharma, right? So we've taken a look what our customers are saying. And I think that if you go back and look at the timing, we've been suffering in lack of bookings there as our customers are prepared for the inevitable. Now they're beginning to call the bottom. And I think that we were early in terms of the reduction of inventory. So our expectation is that bookings inflect positive in the second half of the year on biopharma. It's just going to be a question of the quantum.  On the industrial pump side, I think that they suffered a little bit in terms of this channel destocking. Again, we think that that's bottomed now as a reference. And then -- the one that you have that really wags the tail here is going to be polymer processing, where at one point, we almost had two years of bookings in our backlog, and that's just been slowly deflating as we've shipped off that backlog. So I mean, there's moving parts between long cycle and short cycle. The biggest factors going forward from here is clearly going to be on the biopharma side because to the extent that, that inflects positive, I think that we're all cognizant about the margin impact that has on the segment.\nAndrew Obin: Now this -- your comment on sort of cost of capital and inventories faster than anyone because the entire global supply chain has been floated at no interest rate is going to be fun to watch.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Rich, maybe following up there. You've been, I guess, somewhat cautious on the macro, but you now have a whole slide on Dover strong foundation for '24. So maybe you could overlay your latest thinking on the macro versus that foundation. Would you say in the macro overall is holding up better or worse than you expected. And I know it's early. But given the backlog you have and the additional restructuring benefits for '24, I think you kind of mentioned that '24 could be in line with your sort of longer-term algorithm, which I think is 4% to 6% longer-term growth and 30% incrementals. Does it feel like there's a higher probability of that for '24?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean if you go back and read the transcript, I think I said that about 4x. We think that we knew we had some kind of secular headwinds between the biopharma side and the EMV roll off, we had that coming. That's part and parcel why I think that we were pretty transparent of what we were going to do to pivot our Fueling Solutions business.  And despite having the negative headwind on biopharma, we have preserved our margin in that business. So any incremental volume that we get there should be very attractive. In terms of the total macro, I guess we're happy that demand has held up, right? I mean I think you see part of the negative headwind to some of the destocking because everybody is destocking because they're afraid of the macro to a certain extent.  I think that's been exasperated a little bit by the cost of capital working its way through the system. Where we go from here? I guess we're positioning for a soft landing. Maybe that's optimistic and not generally in our nature around here. But we think the investments that we've made on our growth platforms, as I mentioned in the presentation, are growing at 20-plus percent.  And if we get some recovery on some of the secular headwinds we get, then you can easily go back to what we had laid out as our financial objectives. And you couple that with the fact that we've got a material amount of cost savings that roll from '23 into '24, that's a pretty good start in terms of margin.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Rich, that's helpful. And then maybe you can just talk about the puts and takes you're seeing in DCST. Maybe you could -- you talked about maybe some potential incremental weakness in , but the rest of the business seems quite healthy. I think you had the debooking last quarter in door cases, where is that? Do you still expect that in the second half? And so just talk to us about puts and takes of the business because you said overall, it's pretty good.\nRichard Tobin: Sure. Look, Belvac, it was great while it lasted. So we would expect that to -- it's a cyclical business, CapEx in this space is set to come down. I think that you've got to be careful about what your margin assumptions are in Belvac because we had a lot of engineering project work that was not just equipment-based. So the equipment we make some really healthy margins, but it was diluting. It basically boosted the revenue because we were more of a -- we moved to be more of an integrator. So I think that we can -- while the top line in Belvac was declined, I think that the margin preservation opportunity there is solid.  Right now, we're sold out in heat exchanges. If you go back again and look at the transcript here, the leverage on heat exchanges as -- it should be compelling. I mean, labor is 10% of our COGS. So think about it that way about what we need to cover there. Again, we're growing at 20%. I'll leave it up to the HVAC guys to talk about what the growth rates because we see them all over the place around heat pumps, but the fact of the matter is we're in the midst of increasing our capacity somewhere in the order of 40% to 50%, and it's all going to be in place by mid-2024. And so I think that will take care of any worries about what the cyclical decline in Belvac is.  On Refrigeration, we had our highest margin performance ever, at least in my tenure here in June. And that is even before we've ramped capacity at our new plant for CO2, which I think I'm going to go to on Thursday and Friday and see what we're here. We're probably not going to see the benefit of the NAFTA CO2 meaningfully. It's growing at like 80% right now, but it's off a really low base. But our expectation is, is that volume as it comes in is going to be accretive to margins in refrigeration.  So if I couple where we're exiting June in terms of core refrigeration, in terms of margin, and I add on what we expect to be a high-growth platform in CO2, which we've proven we can do in Europe. It looks good so far. So -- and as I mentioned in my comments, we're having at least the conversations right now around core for refrigeration with our clients about demand for 2024. So far, so good. It seems to be quite positive.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoseph Ritchie: Can we just maybe just go back to the ERP issue. And Rich, maybe just talk us through a little bit what happened this quarter? And then it seems like it's largely behind you, but just want to make sure that there aren't any lingering effects in Q3.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I've been doing ERP implementations for 30 years, and they never go right. This one went a little bit more wrong than usual. Look, at the end of the day, I mean, I own it, right? I mean we basically put a bunch of CapEx into our main plant in Madison, Indiana. That's not completely done. And at the same time, I think if you recall the presentation we made about this business, we had harmonized our SKUs meaningfully.  And quite frankly, in retrospect, trying to do an ERP when you're doing all that work on the manufacturing floor was misguided on my part. So that was just too much change to move to a new ERP system. At the same time, we have really trouble getting product out the door for the entire quarter, but it was worse at the beginning and we got progressively better as we exited June in terms of our production.  I don't think it's going to be a material headwind from here. I don't think we're completely out of the woods yet, but I don't think it's something that we'll be talking about earnings from here. I mean we do ERP implementations year-round year, and we've been doing them for years. Just I think it's my fault. I think I pushed one on a business that was too much to chew, but we're really excited about the opportunity that we have in e-commerce in this business, and you need a operated ERP to affect that e-commerce change and it kind of blew the plant up.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes, I'd just echo what Rich said that we exited June at a pace that puts us on track for what we forecast for Q3. And as he said in the script, you can go back and look, we're going to try to recover, but we're not forecasting a recovery of that $50 million. So I think we're being prudent in terms of the way we think about the trajectory of that business in North America.\nJoseph Ritchie: Got it. No, that's helpful. And obviously, I always appreciate the transparency. My follow-up comment, I guess, would be just around like the business. So the margin profile of the business is trending a little bit lower than you originally expected for the year to kind of think about the second half kind of maybe talk to us about some puts and takes on the margin side, fully recognizing that biopharma is the swing factor.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Biopharma is the swing factor. I think we've beaten that one pretty good. And you're going to take a look at what's Sartorius and Danaher and Thermo talk about it. They are much more informed in terms of when the pivot is going to be. I can tell you that. We're prepared in terms of at least operationally when the pivot comes, we're in good shape there.  It's a little bit -- I talked about the fact that industrial pumps was down because of some unexpected destocking. We think that that's sort of done. And then conversely, you've just got the mix effect of polymer processing and precision components did really well and have been doing really well all year, offsetting the negative headwinds in biopharma, but from a mix perspective, it just becomes dilutive to the margin. So weirdly, if they grow faster than expected, the actual consolidated margin comes down, but the absolute profit performance is entirely acceptable because even those 2 businesses are accretive to the consolidated portfolio margin.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Rich, can we just kind of talk about the margin progression a little bit sequentially. So I guess in EP, right, you have about a 200 bps hit on the ERP issue. Just kind of what the trajectory is out of Q2 as you normalize there? And then on DPPS, right, you said margins up in Q4 year-over-year. I guess that implies you're still down year-over-year in Q3. But would you expect sequential improvement in Q3? Or is the margin improvement in DPPS all kind of Q4 weighted?\nRichard Tobin: Okay. Yes, for DEP, you got it, right? So the margin decline in Q2 is solely on the fact on the VSG volumes coming out. As we move forward from here, you've got the capacity ramp and ESG that comes through, right? So that goose is the top line, and that's let's call that at par margin for DEP. You've got the recovery in VSG. And based on our backlog, we've got increased margin performance in defense just as we ship against the backlog. So that basically gives you the answer for second half margin performance there.  On DPPS, right now, our forecast show a negative headwind for Q3 solely on biopharma. And then our expectation, as I mentioned in the comments, depending on order rates and everything else, is that for Q4, we'll do better based on mix and some recovery on biopharma because it's not as if we're not shipping anything in biopharma. It's just the comparative headwind rolls off by the time we get to Q4.\nJeffrey Sprague: Right. And then thinking about price cost, Rich, I assume that's sort of kind of buried in your growth conversion in the bridge. But what's going on with price cost in the back half of the year?\nRichard Tobin: The price benefit is less in the back half of the year and the cost is based on where we're tracking right now. So we don't basically to make any assumptions in terms of other than leverage. We don't make any assumptions about either positive or negative on the input costs. We'll just see how that develops over the second half.\nJeffrey Sprague: Maybe just one last one. I mean the questions I just asked about margins kind of get to Q3 versus Q4. But since we all kind of -- we got a Q2 that you're kind of characterizing is in line with what you expected ex the ERP, but we didn't quite totally get the message, right? So anything else you want to say about Q3 relative to Q4 or just the balance between those 2 would be helpful I think.\nRichard Tobin: I understand where you're going. All the stick I get about being negative all the time at these conferences and then apparently not negative enough in terms of segmenting the quarters. Look, I think that Q4 is going to be higher than expected. Q3 to Q3 is going to be more or less and in line. But I'd be careful at Q3, again, for the reason I mentioned, right? So you've got the negative biopharma in Q3, which is -- it's not so much a top line issue.  It's more of a margin contribution issue. And then we've got certain businesses that we expect to ship heavy in Q4, which is part and parcel to the end of the depletion of the inventory. So we're not getting into giving out quarterly guidance. I think I would be -- cautious isn't the wrong word. I just think that we're going to have a better Q4 than is likely in models currently.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes. So it sequentially improves off of Q2 into Q3, but year-over-year, like Rich said, we're looking at a more comparable point on year-over-year. But again, we're expecting margin improvement for the full year for the total company. So therefore, in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nCharles Tusa: A little bit to Jeff's question on, I guess, from a sales perspective, I guess what I'm struggling a little bit with is the sequential increase. I mean you got to be up sequentially half to half 9%. Got to do, I think, like roughly $4.5 billion, $4.6 billion in the second half and you're trending at 2.1. So I guess I'm just wondering, like, is that -- you're saying that's kind of all just out of backlog effectively. And so you don't need this bookings number to improve very much.\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, like, yes, I don't think that we need the bookings to improve very much because you've got to be really careful about the long-cycle business. I mean, we do segments. And as you know, within the segments, we've got a mix of business. So we're going to have probably a pretty heavy depletion in backlog. Let's talk about DPPS of Maag, right? Maag sold out for the year.  So basically going to ship against that for the balance of the year. So it's going to make the bookings look a little bit negative. Now whether those get offset, we've got a lot of strength in bookings in Precision Components, and we would expect bookings to get better in biopharma, but we'll see whether that is a Q3 phenomenon or a Q4 phenomena.  I would back up for a moment and go take a look at the presentation we made and look at Slide 10 and take a look at what is required in terms of a conversion point of view. And if you take kind of mid 0.30% conversion and you're back into the number on the EPS accretion, that we need in the back half, it's not Herculean, right, because we almost have as much cost restructuring and cost actions is equal to what we need to get in terms of the revenue conversion.  So if we did not have that, I think there would be a little bit of a tough part in terms of the revenue required in the conversion. I think that all the work that we've done starting in the back half of last year has allowed us to be in the position of I don't know how the -- completely how the macro is going to develop. I mean these knuckleheads are going to go and raise interest rates again and that's not helpful. But the reason that we're confident about the back half is we've got almost -- we've got more than half of the required EPS conversion and cost savings that we've already enacted.\nCharles Tusa: Right. Did you expect -- did you expect bookings -- did you expect bookings to get worse from here sequentially? Or have we kind of bottomed on the bookings now?\nRichard Tobin: Hard to say. Hard to say. I mean you could have flat bookings in Q3. I mean there's an awareness in the marketplace that production lead times have come. So if our bookings, which are higher than normal, basically backstop our revenue for next year in the vast majority of our portfolio, you really don't need to start ordering until the beginning of Q4.  Now whether we can pull some of that in through market signaling, and that's when we start getting into what are we going to do about pricing in 2024, what are we going to go out to the marketplace and say about SWEP like weirdly, we're sold out in SWEP, but our bookings -- if you looked at our bookings in SWEP, you would think that we have no bookings for Q4 just because that's the dynamic of how that business works.  It's capacity reservation as opposed to bookings. So I wouldn't get excited about bookings. I can tell you factually, we'll ship off the back of Belvac and Maag, which will have a disproportionate negative impact on those 2 segments. The balance of the portfolio, I would presume in the short-cycle side, we're probably bottoming in bookings right now.\nCharles Tusa: All right. And then just one last one for you, Rich, just philosophically. I mean, the Slide 11 has like 9 different businesses, and that's only 40% of your portfolio. This has always been a bit of a complex portfolio, but the amount of things that you've had to walk through today, the amount of things that have happened in the last couple of quarters, whether it's the $90 million pushout, the ERP in somewhat obscure businesses, albeit pretty good businesses.  I think the only people that dislike having to dig into these little $100 million businesses, more than it sounds like you talk about them is us maybe. At what point do you kind of really take a much closer look at this portfolio and just kind of say it's just too complex to kind of run and manage, let alone invest in. I think that's kind of one of the issues here that people are having. Is there just always something moving around.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. No, I get it, and I will make -- I'll answer it 2 different ways. I think if you go back and look at the transcript, I talked about the portfolio and read what you'd like about that. And I'll make an argument that in 2024, the diversity of our portfolio will outperform certain secular themes that it's going to be an advantage in '24. It may not have been an advantage over the past 18 months just because of the disproportionate negative weight of biopharma, quite frankly. But I'm willing to bet in 2024, all the work we've done and the diversity of our portfolio would be an advantage as opposed to being kind of something that's singular in terms of market exposure that may be easy to understand.\nCharles Tusa: So can you grow double-digit EPS in '24? .\nRichard Tobin: Too early to tell. Too early to tell. I think it's going to be dependent on the macro, but I think that I can tell you that where we've invested, we're really excited about what we're getting out of it. And I think there are parts of our portfolio that have had negative headwinds. You can't really see it just because of the individual pieces that are really inflecting the other way. So I know that waste handling is not exciting, but the fact of the matter is that business could be up substantially in .\nCharles Tusa: All right. The gauntlets lay down. '24 is the year.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Halloran with Baird.\nMichael Halloran: So the short cycle side of things, just some clarification here. I think basically what you're saying is the sell-out in the channel is actually pretty stable, pretty healthy sell-in because of the inventory destock side of things, that's where the headwind is and the expectations from here for that sellout piece to remain relatively stable. I mean that's a fair characterization.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean I think that the end market demand has been okay across -- from the distribution side of the portfolio. But sell out, so the sell-out metrics look good. The channel checks that we're getting is basically our distributors saying the cost of capital on our inventory is just getting a bit much to bear here, and we're going to wait because, by the way, we know your lead times are down and we want the product, we can get it from. And look, I get it, right? Everybody is trying to maximize cash flow just because of the cost of carrying that cash flow, including us, by the way. So I don't think that distribution would be unique here. I think the good news is that the end market demand itself has remained pretty good overall.\nMichael Halloran: Yes, makes sense. And then just on the imaging side of things, it sounds like things are a little bit more sluggish there, just some context and how much entirely just a little bit tightening on the consumer side or any other variables worth mentioning?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, it's the 1 -- well, 1 or 2 -- we have 2 businesses that have kind of a material exposure to China, and that's one of them. And that is just a reflection mostly of demand to China being quite poor.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: And I definitely listen to the exportation to check the transcript. But I wanted to put a finer point on a couple of things. One was just third quarter sales, Rich, are we assuming from what you said about shipping out of backlog in Q4 that sort of third quarter sales are flattish sequentially, and then you'll get this lift in the fourth quarter as the backlog depletes. And with your comments on bookings to be sort of flattish Q3 and then in flex maybe Q4. Were those sort of sequential comments as well? I just wanted to check that, please.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Julian, I don't want to be overtly negative about Q3, all right? So Q3 is going to get sequentially better. It's just that proportionally based on where we can see the orders and when they're due to ship that sequentially, Q4 is going to be better than it's been over the last I don't want to go back to 2020, I don't remember, but it's going to go back to the way we looked pre-pandemic, where we shipped pretty heavily in Q4.  And then it just becomes a question of production performance in Q4 and that is going to be dependent on what the order rates look like between Q3 and Q4? And do we have to start building out in Q4 for volume for '24. Now there's going to be some businesses where that's the case. So the businesses that were sold out this year, which is several portions of the portfolio, we're going to start taking orders for '24 relatively soon. We're taking orders and right now in certain parts of the portfolio for that.  So I don't want to be overly negative on Q3. I think the Q3 is going to be a good quarter. But I think the Q4, at least comparably is going to be a better quarter. I think that in terms of the order rates -- it's more of a we'll see. We know we're going to ship off backlog in Q3 pretty heavily. So they may be book-to-bill maybe less than 1. It may not be. And our expectation is that Q4 should be up at least almost by definition comparably.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. And then trying to switch away from bookings and backlog and so on maybe just capital deployment that there hasn't been that much on. You'd mentioned sort of watch this space, I think, on M&A in the coming months. It's been a pretty more abundant M&A environment for 18-plus months. So kind of how do you see that? And then also with the stock where it is, a lot of people view the valuation is undemanding. Kind of what's the appeal on share buybacks given the sort of solid outlook for 2024 that you've talked about? .\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Our hierarchy remains the same. I think we haven't added anything in terms of our CapEx plans because we've actually had good 3, 4 years of a lot of spending in terms of recapitalizing some portions of our portfolio, and that's in our rearview mirror now. So by and large, our CapEx as a percentage of sales it's coming down this year, and it should continue that trajectory, even if I take into account the CapEx that we're building out on our growth platforms.  So that leaves M&A as the second hierarchy. Competition is less than there's not a lot of assets out there, but competition is less. So PE is a bit stopped out right now for the reasons we can understand. So that -- we're looking at some attractive things here, but we're going to keep our discipline in terms of the return. And clearly, if you remember from last year, we get to the midyear, we basically forecast our cash flow as we take a look at our deal pipeline. And if you remember last year, we deployed -- how much was it $0.5 billion?\nBrad Cerepak: $0.5 billion\nRichard Tobin: $0.5 billion in an ASR in September of last year. So we've got a Board meeting coming up, and we'll go through all those dynamics again, and we'll decide what to do.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Sorry to beat on this ERP and I will check the transcript in case I missed it. But just, Brad, you said you're not including a recouping of the $50 million that was disrupted this quarter. Does that go into past due? Or did you lose any of those orders?\nRichard Tobin: You lose the order Deane. A lot of that is sold into distribution and that the product is available, you would lose out of the order. So we'll recoup some of it, but I think that we will not recruit all of it. .\nBrad Cerepak: Yes. My commentary was more around our view is the back half is not dependent upon recovery of the $50 million. I want to be clear, that's the point really at the end of the day. The team there will try their best. But it is a business that, as Rich says, our customer base stocks these things in distribution and they move out. And if it's not there, they go to the next available competitive unit. So that's the way we see it.\nDeane Dray: All right. That's really helpful. And then, Brad, in the second half inventory draw down, how much of that is coming just simply from billing orders versus reducing buffer inventory. Are you able to size that?\nBrad Cerepak: Not explicitly, but I think the way we're working through it is that -- it's mainly driven by, I would say, more towards -- tilted towards the safety stock levels, the buffer inventory and raw materials in the materials flow where what we have to see is less inflow versus production to draw it down. And that's what's happening here in the second quarter. I mean, we did have slightly negative inventory through the first half of the year. But it's a heck of a lot better than it was a year ago, and we're continuing to make progress to make sure production is in excess of the inflows. That's the way we're working it. I think that's it, Jack. Okay.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Are you sure? Do you want to finish it off or should I ask the question?\nBrad Cerepak: Go ahead. We didn't want to cut you off.\nNigel Coe: Yes, don't worry. I'm kidding. Look, so look, we love your macro perspective. You were very early to be cautious and what you so. But it seems like some of the CapEx businesses may be trending a bit weaker. Belvac, Hill PHOENIX. Maybe just some perspective on what you're seeing in those capital businesses. And is it an adjustment to higher rates? Macro uncertainty, what do you think -- how do you think this plays out?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, I think the Belvac is a cyclical business. There was a lot of capital that was put in during the pandemic years into can-making. We did fabulous in terms of market participation there versus our competitors, but we fully expect and have been preparing for over the last 18 months were there be some roll down because you just can't keep at that kind of pace. Now having said that, I don't think it's a negative of a story either just because of the fact that the revenue was a bit influenced by some engineering work that we did at very low margins and while we sold the equipment.  And we're actually working on some interesting IP related projects that may help us out to ride the CapEx. On the Refrigeration side, we had that order cancellation that we talked about at the end of last quarter. That was very customer specific. The balance of the demand is decent. I think that there's a little bit of the same frictional costs in terms of labor availability and installation. That's not our problem. It's our customers' problem. The pace of that CapEx tends to be a bit choppy, but the conversations that we're having, and I think it's in the -- in the transcript, the conversations we're having about 2024 in terms of demand in that particular space are good. And I'm just talking about kind of the old traditional case business. Without even getting into natural refrigerants where we're growing at a very heady pace in North America right now off a low base. But based on the conversations that we're having this we feel very excited about where this thing could go.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's helpful. A quick follow-on, if I can. Retail fielding, you mentioned focusing on and obviously, the restructuring actions that speak to that. You've talked about this before, but is this like a double and down of that strategy? Does this become even more of a focus on just cash flow as opposed to growth.\nRichard Tobin: No. I mean I think we have individual strategies for every business that we have in the portfolio. Obviously, if you go back a couple of years ago, this was EVs are taking over the world and the negative headwinds of EMV plus that the view of what these businesses were worth was, I think, a completely overdone. We think that we've got 20 years of high-margin opportunity into that space. But having said that, we're just repositioning that business where we think that we've upgraded the entire product line globally, by the way, not just in the United States, that we can run that. We can run this business a lot more or a lot more lean than we did in the past, and that's the actions you see us taking. We think we can get that segment to 25%. And you're seeing some of the building blocks working our way there.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm now on Slide 7. The top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 3%, driven by declines in Engineered Products and Clean Energy & Fueling. Acquisitions contributed 1% to the top line in the quarter, and FX translation was a 1% headwind.  FX headwinds resulted in $0.02 negative EPS impact in the quarter and $0.09 in the first half. Based on year-over-year exchange rates, we expect FX to be an $0.08 tailwind to EPS in the second half of the year. From a geo perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was down 9% in the quarter due to expected lower volumes in the aboveground retail fueling segment as well as lower shipments from vehicle services in North America.  Europe was down 1% and Asia was up 2%. China, which represent about half of our revenue base in Asia was up 5% organically in the quarter. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to normalizing lead times in our shorter-cycle businesses and strong shipments against elevated backlogs in our long cycle and secular growth exposed businesses.  Now on to Slide 8, our cash flow statement. Year-to-date, free cash flow came in at $348 million or 8% of revenue and represents an increase of nearly $250 million year-over-year. As discussed previously, with supply chains improving, we have been actively working to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023. We expect that trend to play out in the second half of the year as higher shipment volumes in the third and fourth quarter should result in a reduction of inventory balances between now and the end of the year. This trend is in line with our normal seasonal pattern, as cash flow generation has historically improved in the second half of the year.  Our forecast for free cash flow remains on track for between 15% and 17% of revenue. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Yes, I'd just echo what Rich said that we exited June at a pace that puts us on track for what we forecast for Q3. And as he said in the script, you can go back and look, we're going to try to recover, but we're not forecasting a recovery of that $50 million. So I think we're being prudent in terms of the way we think about the trajectory of that business in North America. Yes. So it sequentially improves off of Q2 into Q3, but year-over-year, like Rich said, we're looking at a more comparable point on year-over-year. But again, we're expecting margin improvement for the full year for the total company. So therefore, in the fourth quarter. $0.5 billion Yes. My commentary was more around our view is the back half is not dependent upon recovery of the $50 million. I want to be clear, that's the point really at the end of the day. The team there will try their best. But it is a business that, as Rich says, our customer base stocks these things in distribution and they move out. And if it's not there, they go to the next available competitive unit. So that's the way we see it. Not explicitly, but I think the way we're working through it is that -- it's mainly driven by, I would say, more towards -- tilted towards the safety stock levels, the buffer inventory and raw materials in the materials flow where what we have to see is less inflow versus production to draw it down. And that's what's happening here in the second quarter. I mean, we did have slightly negative inventory through the first half of the year. But it's a heck of a lot better than it was a year ago, and we're continuing to make progress to make sure production is in excess of the inflows. That's the way we're working it. I think that's it, Jack. Okay. Go ahead. We didn't want to cut you off."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack. Let's start on Slide 3. Our results are in line with our internal forecast in the second quarter. Our secular growth exposed businesses that we highlighted at our recent Investor Day outperformed in the quarter with heat exchangers, natural refrigerant systems and polymer processing, all posting growth in excess of 20%.  During the quarter, we incurred operational headwinds from our vehicle service group main production facility as a result of an ERP implementation, which cost us approximately $50 million in revenue and approximately $0.10 of EPS. This one's on me. The business has been doing an excellent job on efficiency actions related to fixed costs, SKU management and vertical integration over the past 18 months, which has been reflected in the margin performance conducting a much-needed ERP upgrade, which is fundamental to our e-commerce ambitions, while finishing a large CapEx project was in retrospect overly ambitious. And I guess I should have known better.  We exited June -- the good news, we exited June with far improved production performance at the site, and we'll try our best to claw back the lost volumes in the second half. We have a constructive outlook for the second half of the year and are narrowing our annual EPS guidance to $8.85 to $9. Since the start of the year, we expected 2023 performance to be weighted to the second half due to post-pandemic destocking across the industrial economy and the gradual recovery in several of our end markets, with the seasonality of second half earnings consistent with what we saw in the pre-pandemic years.  Underlying demand remains good across the portfolio and a significant volume of business is already in the backlog. We proactively intervened on our cost structure starting in the latter half of 2022. And we have continued these structural cost reductions in 2023, driving material earnings benefits. As a result, we are less reliant on top line volume or price cost to achieve our forecast in the second half.  With our solid demand outlook, flexible business model and execution playbook, we are confident in delivering our second half target. We also see a solid foundation building for 2024. A large portion of our portfolio has experienced secular -- or cyclical momentum growth exposures that should persist in a variety of macro conditions and we are proactively adding capacity to ensure we continue to win in these markets.  We also expect solid carryover benefits into 2024 from previously announced cost reduction actions. These organic initiatives, together with a strong acquisition pipeline and meaningful cash flow generation will keep us on track to achieve our long-term growth and value creation goals we set forth in our Investor Day in March.  Let's go to Slide 4. Consolidated organic revenue was down 3% in the quarter despite growth in 3 of the 5 segments due to expected comparable volume declines in several end markets and the aforementioned shipment disruptions in vehicle market, which cost us 2% to the top line. Organic bookings were down 8%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92, reflecting better lead times across the portfolio and continued strong shipments against backlogs in our longer cycle and secular growth exposed businesses.  As a result, our backlog continues to normalize, but still remains elevated relative to the pandemic levels. Segment margin was 20.2%, with margin performance preserved despite negative mix and lower volumes due to proactive cost containment actions and lower input costs. We expect the roll forward of these actions together with more normal demand seasonality to drive sequential and comparable operating margin improvement in the second half.  Let's skip to Slide 5, and we'll go through some detailed results on the quarter. Engineered Products was down 8% organically in the quarter. The waste handling business posted a particularly strong quarter, improving chassis availability and aftermarket attachment rates driving solid growth in volumes and new orders. We are presently taking capacity reservations for 2024 and we will be ramping production to meet demand progressively over the balance of the year.  Margins were down 50 basis points year-over-year, principally driven by lower volumes in vehicle aftermarket which offset the robust margin improvement in waste handling. Clean energy and fueling declined 9% on an organic basis as the final quarter of comps impacted the top line and margin mix.  Vehicle wash and clean energy were down slightly in the quarter as distribution inventories were brought down in line with the increased cost to carry on higher interest rates. Channel checks indicate that we are now at appropriate levels for expected second half demand.  Margins in the quarter were down 100 basis points on lower volumes and mix, but partially offset by significant cost reduction actions taken in the retail fueling business as we pivot this business to margin and cash flow maximization. Imaging and ID was flat organically on solid growth in our core marketing coating business in Europe and the Americas as well as strong sales in software, serialization. Shipments in Asia were lower. FX remained a negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in this segment given its large base of non-U.S. dollar revenue.  Margins in Imaging and ID was strong at 23% and improving 40 basis points on pricing and cost controls. Pumps and process was up 1% organically in the quarter, with particular strength in polymer processing equipment, precision components, thermal connectors and hygienic dosing systems. Volumes in industrial pumps was softer due to channel inventory reductions. Operating margin was down due to lower mix of biopharma.  Top line in climate and sustainability technologies were about 4% organically, demand trends remain robust in heat exchanges and CO2 refrigeration systems driven by global investments in sustainability. The segment posted a strong 7% margin in the quarter, up 210 basis points year-over-year on strong volume conversion productivity and positive price cost and mix of products delivered. I'll pass it to Brad from here. All right. Let's go to Slide 9. Here, we show the growth in margin outlook by segment for 2023 that are underpinned in our current time log trends. Our backlog remains elevated across all segments driven primarily by extended backlogs in our longer cycle and secular growth exposed businesses as our lead times continue to normalize and new capacity comes online, we expect these backlogs to continue normalizing through the end of the year.  We expect Engineered products to return to growth in the second half of the year, driven by continued strength in refuse collection vehicles in aerospace and defense. Our waste handling business is fully booked for the year with the possible upside of chassis availability further improves. We expect vehicle aftermarket shipments in North America to recover after the temporary disruption in Q2 and the business should remain relatively stable year-over-year in the back half.  We expect margins to improve in the second half on positive price/cost tailwinds, solid volumes and benefits from our recent productivity capital investments taking hold. In Clean Energy & Fueling, it's expected to return to growth in the second half of the year against easier comparable periods as the end market conditions and channel inventories normalize.  Quoting activity for hydrogen infrastructure components remains robust, and we are working to expand capacity for select products, including vacuum jacketed piping in cryogenic valves. We expect full year margin improvement in Clean Energy & Fueling driven by stronger performance in the second half on volume recovery, improved mix and continued proactive restructuring savings in retail fueling.  Since initiating our fundamental transformation of the retail fueling cost structure last fall, we have initiated or announced $60 million of structural cost reductions in this business. Imaging and ID is expected to continue its stable performance, albeit against tougher comps in the second half, driven by stable outlook in core marketing and coding and serialization. Software full year margins should remain at attractive levels for this segment.  Pumps and process equipment is expected to remain roughly flat organically in the second half. Thermal connectors continued to grow at a double-digit clip with some notable customer wins. Following a record Q2 Precision Components continues to book and ship at robust levels and with a notable mix in business towards energy transition markets, polymer processing is booked for the year.  The biopharma environment is improving with market conditions such as FDA approvals for new promising therapies and recovery in biotech funding and inventory stocking all showing improvement as indicated by our customers who have released results over the past few days. We expect margins in this segment to remain best-in-class levels with performance skewed towards the end of the year on stronger volumes and mix improvements. Order rates and biopharma will be the watch item from here with the potential recovery -- with the potential for this recovery to be a material tailwind into 2024.  Climate and Sustainability Technologies top line trajectory is expected to be steady in the second half of the year. We are operating close to capacity in heat exchanges for heat pumps with incremental capacity coming online over the next several quarters with direct labor at less than 10% of revenue, the conversion on growth in heat exchanges is compelling.  Demand for CO2 refrigeration systems remain solid, and our capacity build-out is on schedule. We are starting to have productive conversations for our door case business with large retailers for their 2024 plans, which is an encouraging indicator of future demand. Beverage can-making is expected to be down as the industry is digesting recent record capacity additions.  We expect continued margin improvement in 2023 on volume conversion, productivity gains and improved mix. Our margin performance in refrigeration has been very encouraging even before the material accretive impact of North American CO2 volume.  Let's go to Slide 10. Here is the confidence we have in the underlying components that drive our forecasted double-digit EPS growth in the second half. We have been vocal about the negative impact of interest costs on channel inventories and have been encouraged that to draw down, while a headwind to the first half revenue has been orderly as end market demand is largely held up.  Recognizing that our markets are not immune to these dynamics, we have proactively enacted cost containment actions to derisk the second half of the year and also provide $40 million of incremental carryover cost savings into 2024 with roughly half the savings coming from retail fueling as part of our strategy to pivot to margin and cash flow maximization of this business. We believe our growth and conversion forecast is achieved based on our revenue visibility and backlog, channel inventory stabilization, secular growth tailwinds and recovery in end markets.  So let's go to Slide 11. We view 2023 as a transition year for our business from a supply chain constrained inflationary high-demand environment of 21 to 22 to a more normalized activity supported by various macro trends. As we move to the second half of the year, the majority of the destocking headwinds behind us and recovery across several end markets we are building solid momentum for 2024.  We are investing meaningfully behind our secular growth exposed end markets to ensure we have sufficient capacity to serve our customers. We are proactively engaging in new product development, often in co-development with our OEM partners to drive product improvement they win share in the marketplace. We believe our biopharma and retail fueling dispenser visits, which were in face with expected market-driven headwinds in 2023, are poised for strong margin accretive recoveries in 2024.  All in, we believe at least 40% of our portfolio is experiencing tailwinds that are decoupled from broader industrial production with additional pockets of growth in our market-leading niche industrial franchises. This growth outlook together, the carryover benefit of cost actions into '24, set up a solid foundation for our growth prospects in line with our financial commitments from our Investor Day in March.  So let's move to Slide 12. With our supply chains and operational environment normalizing our forecast for 2023 embedded in a return to pre-pandemic seasonality, the year has played out more or less as we expected thus far with more challenging half of the year now in the rearview mirror. The path from here is straightforward. Underlying demand is solid across our business, and we are confident in our ability to leverage a flexible operating model centralized business systems to drive consolidated growth and margin accretion to achieve our full year guidance.  Our inorganic pipeline remains robust. We remain committed to optimizing our business portfolio and evaluating some interesting options, which we hope to conclude in the second half of the year. That's it for me. I'll turn it back to you, Jack. Yes. I think you have to delink the comments we made about destocking from bookings to a certain extent. So I mean, the bookings number is related to the reduction in the backlog as the backlog slowly deflates and we expect that to continue some. So I wouldn't -- I think we've been pretty vocal about that all year. I think that what has changed in the first half of the year is the realization that the carrying cost of inventory in the channel has gone up exponentially, right?  So if you go take a look at the cost of financing inventory at a distribution level, gone up by 600 or 700 basis points. So I don't think it's unique when a company like Dover says moving into this year that we're going to run for cash and deplete our inventories. I think by and large, everybody was poised to do that. I think that what was underestimated was the short-term negative headwind on the cost to carry.  By doing the -- where we've seen that and where we've done channel checks, we believe that the vast majority of that reduction on the cost to carry is behind us. So we don't have that negative headwind going in the second half of the year, but I wouldn't get all caught up on the bookings side because the bookings are going to be reflective of the backlog decreasing, and I think that they're likely to inflect positive likely in Q4. Yes. Well, I mean, I think that if you go back and read the transcript, I called out that the watch item from here is going to be bookings in biopharma, right? So we've taken a look what our customers are saying. And I think that if you go back and look at the timing, we've been suffering in lack of bookings there as our customers are prepared for the inevitable. Now they're beginning to call the bottom. And I think that we were early in terms of the reduction of inventory. So our expectation is that bookings inflect positive in the second half of the year on biopharma. It's just going to be a question of the quantum.  On the industrial pump side, I think that they suffered a little bit in terms of this channel destocking. Again, we think that that's bottomed now as a reference. And then -- the one that you have that really wags the tail here is going to be polymer processing, where at one point, we almost had two years of bookings in our backlog, and that's just been slowly deflating as we've shipped off that backlog. So I mean, there's moving parts between long cycle and short cycle. The biggest factors going forward from here is clearly going to be on the biopharma side because to the extent that, that inflects positive, I think that we're all cognizant about the margin impact that has on the segment. Yes. I mean if you go back and read the transcript, I think I said that about 4x. We think that we knew we had some kind of secular headwinds between the biopharma side and the EMV roll off, we had that coming. That's part and parcel why I think that we were pretty transparent of what we were going to do to pivot our Fueling Solutions business.  And despite having the negative headwind on biopharma, we have preserved our margin in that business. So any incremental volume that we get there should be very attractive. In terms of the total macro, I guess we're happy that demand has held up, right? I mean I think you see part of the negative headwind to some of the destocking because everybody is destocking because they're afraid of the macro to a certain extent.  I think that's been exasperated a little bit by the cost of capital working its way through the system. Where we go from here? I guess we're positioning for a soft landing. Maybe that's optimistic and not generally in our nature around here. But we think the investments that we've made on our growth platforms, as I mentioned in the presentation, are growing at 20-plus percent.  And if we get some recovery on some of the secular headwinds we get, then you can easily go back to what we had laid out as our financial objectives. And you couple that with the fact that we've got a material amount of cost savings that roll from '23 into '24, that's a pretty good start in terms of margin. Sure. Look, Belvac, it was great while it lasted. So we would expect that to -- it's a cyclical business, CapEx in this space is set to come down. I think that you've got to be careful about what your margin assumptions are in Belvac because we had a lot of engineering project work that was not just equipment-based. So the equipment we make some really healthy margins, but it was diluting. It basically boosted the revenue because we were more of a -- we moved to be more of an integrator. So I think that we can -- while the top line in Belvac was declined, I think that the margin preservation opportunity there is solid.  Right now, we're sold out in heat exchanges. If you go back again and look at the transcript here, the leverage on heat exchanges as -- it should be compelling. I mean, labor is 10% of our COGS. So think about it that way about what we need to cover there. Again, we're growing at 20%. I'll leave it up to the HVAC guys to talk about what the growth rates because we see them all over the place around heat pumps, but the fact of the matter is we're in the midst of increasing our capacity somewhere in the order of 40% to 50%, and it's all going to be in place by mid-2024. And so I think that will take care of any worries about what the cyclical decline in Belvac is.  On Refrigeration, we had our highest margin performance ever, at least in my tenure here in June. And that is even before we've ramped capacity at our new plant for CO2, which I think I'm going to go to on Thursday and Friday and see what we're here. We're probably not going to see the benefit of the NAFTA CO2 meaningfully. It's growing at like 80% right now, but it's off a really low base. But our expectation is, is that volume as it comes in is going to be accretive to margins in refrigeration.  So if I couple where we're exiting June in terms of core refrigeration, in terms of margin, and I add on what we expect to be a high-growth platform in CO2, which we've proven we can do in Europe. It looks good so far. So -- and as I mentioned in my comments, we're having at least the conversations right now around core for refrigeration with our clients about demand for 2024. So far, so good. It seems to be quite positive. Yes. I've been doing ERP implementations for 30 years, and they never go right. This one went a little bit more wrong than usual. Look, at the end of the day, I mean, I own it, right? I mean we basically put a bunch of CapEx into our main plant in Madison, Indiana. That's not completely done. And at the same time, I think if you recall the presentation we made about this business, we had harmonized our SKUs meaningfully.  And quite frankly, in retrospect, trying to do an ERP when you're doing all that work on the manufacturing floor was misguided on my part. So that was just too much change to move to a new ERP system. At the same time, we have really trouble getting product out the door for the entire quarter, but it was worse at the beginning and we got progressively better as we exited June in terms of our production.  I don't think it's going to be a material headwind from here. I don't think we're completely out of the woods yet, but I don't think it's something that we'll be talking about earnings from here. I mean we do ERP implementations year-round year, and we've been doing them for years. Just I think it's my fault. I think I pushed one on a business that was too much to chew, but we're really excited about the opportunity that we have in e-commerce in this business, and you need a operated ERP to affect that e-commerce change and it kind of blew the plant up. Yes. Biopharma is the swing factor. I think we've beaten that one pretty good. And you're going to take a look at what's Sartorius and Danaher and Thermo talk about it. They are much more informed in terms of when the pivot is going to be. I can tell you that. We're prepared in terms of at least operationally when the pivot comes, we're in good shape there.  It's a little bit -- I talked about the fact that industrial pumps was down because of some unexpected destocking. We think that that's sort of done. And then conversely, you've just got the mix effect of polymer processing and precision components did really well and have been doing really well all year, offsetting the negative headwinds in biopharma, but from a mix perspective, it just becomes dilutive to the margin. So weirdly, if they grow faster than expected, the actual consolidated margin comes down, but the absolute profit performance is entirely acceptable because even those 2 businesses are accretive to the consolidated portfolio margin. Okay. Yes, for DEP, you got it, right? So the margin decline in Q2 is solely on the fact on the VSG volumes coming out. As we move forward from here, you've got the capacity ramp and ESG that comes through, right? So that goose is the top line, and that's let's call that at par margin for DEP. You've got the recovery in VSG. And based on our backlog, we've got increased margin performance in defense just as we ship against the backlog. So that basically gives you the answer for second half margin performance there.  On DPPS, right now, our forecast show a negative headwind for Q3 solely on biopharma. And then our expectation, as I mentioned in the comments, depending on order rates and everything else, is that for Q4, we'll do better based on mix and some recovery on biopharma because it's not as if we're not shipping anything in biopharma. It's just the comparative headwind rolls off by the time we get to Q4. The price benefit is less in the back half of the year and the cost is based on where we're tracking right now. So we don't basically to make any assumptions in terms of other than leverage. We don't make any assumptions about either positive or negative on the input costs. We'll just see how that develops over the second half. I understand where you're going. All the stick I get about being negative all the time at these conferences and then apparently not negative enough in terms of segmenting the quarters. Look, I think that Q4 is going to be higher than expected. Q3 to Q3 is going to be more or less and in line. But I'd be careful at Q3, again, for the reason I mentioned, right? So you've got the negative biopharma in Q3, which is -- it's not so much a top line issue.  It's more of a margin contribution issue. And then we've got certain businesses that we expect to ship heavy in Q4, which is part and parcel to the end of the depletion of the inventory. So we're not getting into giving out quarterly guidance. I think I would be -- cautious isn't the wrong word. I just think that we're going to have a better Q4 than is likely in models currently. Well, I mean, like, yes, I don't think that we need the bookings to improve very much because you've got to be really careful about the long-cycle business. I mean, we do segments. And as you know, within the segments, we've got a mix of business. So we're going to have probably a pretty heavy depletion in backlog. Let's talk about DPPS of Maag, right? Maag sold out for the year.  So basically going to ship against that for the balance of the year. So it's going to make the bookings look a little bit negative. Now whether those get offset, we've got a lot of strength in bookings in Precision Components, and we would expect bookings to get better in biopharma, but we'll see whether that is a Q3 phenomenon or a Q4 phenomena.  I would back up for a moment and go take a look at the presentation we made and look at Slide 10 and take a look at what is required in terms of a conversion point of view. And if you take kind of mid 0.30% conversion and you're back into the number on the EPS accretion, that we need in the back half, it's not Herculean, right, because we almost have as much cost restructuring and cost actions is equal to what we need to get in terms of the revenue conversion.  So if we did not have that, I think there would be a little bit of a tough part in terms of the revenue required in the conversion. I think that all the work that we've done starting in the back half of last year has allowed us to be in the position of I don't know how the -- completely how the macro is going to develop. I mean these knuckleheads are going to go and raise interest rates again and that's not helpful. But the reason that we're confident about the back half is we've got almost -- we've got more than half of the required EPS conversion and cost savings that we've already enacted. Hard to say. Hard to say. I mean you could have flat bookings in Q3. I mean there's an awareness in the marketplace that production lead times have come. So if our bookings, which are higher than normal, basically backstop our revenue for next year in the vast majority of our portfolio, you really don't need to start ordering until the beginning of Q4.  Now whether we can pull some of that in through market signaling, and that's when we start getting into what are we going to do about pricing in 2024, what are we going to go out to the marketplace and say about SWEP like weirdly, we're sold out in SWEP, but our bookings -- if you looked at our bookings in SWEP, you would think that we have no bookings for Q4 just because that's the dynamic of how that business works.  It's capacity reservation as opposed to bookings. So I wouldn't get excited about bookings. I can tell you factually, we'll ship off the back of Belvac and Maag, which will have a disproportionate negative impact on those 2 segments. The balance of the portfolio, I would presume in the short-cycle side, we're probably bottoming in bookings right now. Yes. No, I get it, and I will make -- I'll answer it 2 different ways. I think if you go back and look at the transcript, I talked about the portfolio and read what you'd like about that. And I'll make an argument that in 2024, the diversity of our portfolio will outperform certain secular themes that it's going to be an advantage in '24. It may not have been an advantage over the past 18 months just because of the disproportionate negative weight of biopharma, quite frankly. But I'm willing to bet in 2024, all the work we've done and the diversity of our portfolio would be an advantage as opposed to being kind of something that's singular in terms of market exposure that may be easy to understand. Too early to tell. Too early to tell. I think it's going to be dependent on the macro, but I think that I can tell you that where we've invested, we're really excited about what we're getting out of it. And I think there are parts of our portfolio that have had negative headwinds. You can't really see it just because of the individual pieces that are really inflecting the other way. So I know that waste handling is not exciting, but the fact of the matter is that business could be up substantially in . Yes. I mean I think that the end market demand has been okay across -- from the distribution side of the portfolio. But sell out, so the sell-out metrics look good. The channel checks that we're getting is basically our distributors saying the cost of capital on our inventory is just getting a bit much to bear here, and we're going to wait because, by the way, we know your lead times are down and we want the product, we can get it from. And look, I get it, right? Everybody is trying to maximize cash flow just because of the cost of carrying that cash flow, including us, by the way. So I don't think that distribution would be unique here. I think the good news is that the end market demand itself has remained pretty good overall. Yes, it's the 1 -- well, 1 or 2 -- we have 2 businesses that have kind of a material exposure to China, and that's one of them. And that is just a reflection mostly of demand to China being quite poor. Yes. Julian, I don't want to be overtly negative about Q3, all right? So Q3 is going to get sequentially better. It's just that proportionally based on where we can see the orders and when they're due to ship that sequentially, Q4 is going to be better than it's been over the last I don't want to go back to 2020, I don't remember, but it's going to go back to the way we looked pre-pandemic, where we shipped pretty heavily in Q4.  And then it just becomes a question of production performance in Q4 and that is going to be dependent on what the order rates look like between Q3 and Q4? And do we have to start building out in Q4 for volume for '24. Now there's going to be some businesses where that's the case. So the businesses that were sold out this year, which is several portions of the portfolio, we're going to start taking orders for '24 relatively soon. We're taking orders and right now in certain parts of the portfolio for that.  So I don't want to be overly negative on Q3. I think the Q3 is going to be a good quarter. But I think the Q4, at least comparably is going to be a better quarter. I think that in terms of the order rates -- it's more of a we'll see. We know we're going to ship off backlog in Q3 pretty heavily. So they may be book-to-bill maybe less than 1. It may not be. And our expectation is that Q4 should be up at least almost by definition comparably. Yes. Our hierarchy remains the same. I think we haven't added anything in terms of our CapEx plans because we've actually had good 3, 4 years of a lot of spending in terms of recapitalizing some portions of our portfolio, and that's in our rearview mirror now. So by and large, our CapEx as a percentage of sales it's coming down this year, and it should continue that trajectory, even if I take into account the CapEx that we're building out on our growth platforms.  So that leaves M&A as the second hierarchy. Competition is less than there's not a lot of assets out there, but competition is less. So PE is a bit stopped out right now for the reasons we can understand. So that -- we're looking at some attractive things here, but we're going to keep our discipline in terms of the return. And clearly, if you remember from last year, we get to the midyear, we basically forecast our cash flow as we take a look at our deal pipeline. And if you remember last year, we deployed -- how much was it $0.5 billion? $0.5 billion in an ASR in September of last year. So we've got a Board meeting coming up, and we'll go through all those dynamics again, and we'll decide what to do. You lose the order Deane. A lot of that is sold into distribution and that the product is available, you would lose out of the order. So we'll recoup some of it, but I think that we will not recruit all of it. . Well, I mean, I think the Belvac is a cyclical business. There was a lot of capital that was put in during the pandemic years into can-making. We did fabulous in terms of market participation there versus our competitors, but we fully expect and have been preparing for over the last 18 months were there be some roll down because you just can't keep at that kind of pace. Now having said that, I don't think it's a negative of a story either just because of the fact that the revenue was a bit influenced by some engineering work that we did at very low margins and while we sold the equipment.  And we're actually working on some interesting IP related projects that may help us out to ride the CapEx. On the Refrigeration side, we had that order cancellation that we talked about at the end of last quarter. That was very customer specific. The balance of the demand is decent. I think that there's a little bit of the same frictional costs in terms of labor availability and installation. That's not our problem. It's our customers' problem. The pace of that CapEx tends to be a bit choppy, but the conversations that we're having, and I think it's in the -- in the transcript, the conversations we're having about 2024 in terms of demand in that particular space are good. And I'm just talking about kind of the old traditional case business. Without even getting into natural refrigerants where we're growing at a very heady pace in North America right now off a low base. But based on the conversations that we're having this we feel very excited about where this thing could go. No. I mean I think we have individual strategies for every business that we have in the portfolio. Obviously, if you go back a couple of years ago, this was EVs are taking over the world and the negative headwinds of EMV plus that the view of what these businesses were worth was, I think, a completely overdone. We think that we've got 20 years of high-margin opportunity into that space. But having said that, we're just repositioning that business where we think that we've upgraded the entire product line globally, by the way, not just in the United States, that we can run that. We can run this business a lot more or a lot more lean than we did in the past, and that's the actions you see us taking. We think we can get that segment to 25%. And you're seeing some of the building blocks working our way there."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens, please go ahead, sir.\nJack Dickens: Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through May 17 and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everybody. Let's start with the performance highlights on Slide 3. The quarter was solid overall. We are very pleased with our production performance to start the year which allowed us to begin reducing our inventory balances towards the end of the quarter. Consolidated organic revenue was up 3%, with growth across most of our businesses driven largely by the secular growth tailwinds that we outlined at our most recent Investor Day. The majority of our input and supply chain constraints have dissipated, resulting in production lead times largely returning to pre-pandemic levels. This has led to more normalized order patterns, improved shipping volumes and a gradual reduction of elevated backlog. New order intake was robust in the quarter with four out of five segments posting book-to-bill of one. New bookings increased sequentially in the first quarter, and our order backlog remains elevated compared to normal levels providing us with good visibility for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we de-booked some volume from our backlog and retail refrigeration from a single customer, was put the timing of 2023 capital plan under review. Our expectation is that we'll be rebooking the volume in the second half. Margin performance in the quarter was strong with four out of our five segments improving margins over 100 basis points, driven by broad-based productivity gains, positive price/cost dynamics and prior period investments and cost containment actions. Higher segment earnings performance drove our EPS growth. We had some comparable cost headwinds during the quarter from transitory inorganic activity costs, higher interest expense, FX and tax. Brad will review later. Interest costs are set to drop progressively for the balance of the year and FX at current rates turns into a comparable tailwind in the back half. Our recent investments in automation and productivity projects are paying off, and we are in the process of completing several capacity expansions in our secular growth businesses. The acquisition of Witte in our Pumps & Process Solutions segment, which we completed in December last year is off to a great start and is performing above expectations. Our strong financial position allows us to pursue a healthy pipeline of attractive bolt-on acquisitions and to opportunistically return capital to our shareholders. We are encouraged by the trends and performance so far in 2023. We have a constructive but also watchful outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, demand conditions in our attractive industrial markets remain solid and our bookings are healthy. Our order backlogs, especially in our longer-cycle businesses provide good visibility to our forecast. We are on track to deliver our full year cash flow target as we liquidate inventory in concert with the normalization of our backlog. We are mindful of the mix to macro economic backdrop, and we are staying close to our customers to understand their plans. We have available cost control levers and operational flexibility that should enable us to deliver good results in various macroeconomic environments. With that, we maintain our 2023 full year guidance, 3% to 5% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $8.85 to $9.05 per share. I'll skip Slide 4. Let's move on to the segments. Engineered Products was up 3% organically in the quarter, driven by positive pricing, strong demand for waste handling equipment parts and related digital services. The chassis availability issues that impacted the waste handling business coming out of the pandemic have improved. And to the extent that, that supply continues to be available, we are well positioned to increase shipments meaningfully against strong underlying demand. Margins were up 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by improving supply chains, positive price cost dynamics, mix and as well as investments in productivity initiatives. Clean Energy and Fueling declined by 3% on an organic basis. Revenue is up in clean energy components, vehicle wash, fuel transport and below-ground retail fueling, offset by the expected comparable decline in dispenser and EMV card reader demand. The upcoming second quarter comp is the last of material EMV volume. We remain constructive on the business for the full year as order activity in March was healthy. Despite the lower volume, margins in the quarter were up 120 basis points on positive mix and price cost as well as improved comparable cost structure from previously announced cost reduction actions taken in the retail fueling business. Imaging and ID posted a solid quarter, up 8% organically on broad-based strength in our marking and coding printers, spare parts and consumables. Our serialization software business continues to perform well and win new accounts. FX remained a negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in this segment that drove a large base of non-U.S. dollar revenue. Margins in Imaging and ID were very strong at 24%, improving 260 basis points on volume, conversion, pricing actions and mix. Pumps & Process Solutions declined 7% organically in the quarter, driven principally by the post-COVID transition in the biopharma space. New orders for biopharma grew sequentially during the quarter as the impacts from inventory destocking begin to subside. At the current trajectory, we expect to have one more quarter of headwinds then inflect positively in the second half of the year. All the other businesses in this segment posted solid organic growth during the quarter with particular strength in precision components, industrial pumps, thermal connectors and polymer processing equipment. Operating margin was down against a peak comparable quarter in the prior year due to the mix effect from higher non-biopharma revenue. Top line and Climate and Sustainable Technologies continued its double-digit growth trajectory from the last two years, posting 16% organic growth. Demand trends remain particularly robust in heat exchangers and CO2 refrigeration systems, driven by global investments in sustainability. Beverage can making continued shipping deliveries against its strong backlog. Margins came in at 16% in the quarter, up 280 basis points year-over-year on strong volume conversion, productivity, positive price/cost and good mix of products delivered. I'll pass it to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. The top bridge shows organic revenue growth of 3%, driven by increases in three of our five segments. Acquisitions contributed $19 million to the top line in the quarter. FX translation was a substantial headwind at 2.5% and or $52 million and impacted both our revenue growth and profitability. FX headwinds resulted in $0.06 of negative EPS impact in the quarter. At today's prevailing rates, we expect these FX headwinds to subside as the year progresses against easier comps with roughly $0.10 of negative FX impact forecasted for the first half of the year and $0.05 of favorability in the second half. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was up 3% organically in the quarter. Europe and Asia were flat and down 4%, respectively, on timing, of comparable shipments. We expect organic growth in both regions for the full year. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to foreign currency translation, normalization of lead times across several businesses and a $90 million order de-booking related to a major retail refrigeration customer's decision to temporarily pause its new store expansion program. Now let's move to cash flow on Slide 7. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $193 million or 9% of revenue. This represents a record first quarter free cash flow and was up over $200 million year-over-year. The first quarter is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of investments in working capital to support growth in the year ahead. As discussed previously, our supply chains -- with supply chains improving, we have been actively working to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023 and we are beginning to see the results materialize. We expect our working capital balances and particularly our inventories to reduce over the balance of the year and to be a significant driver of year-over-year cash flow. Excluding any impacts from acquisitions, we should materially pay down commercial paper balances over the next several quarters. As a result, we would expect interest expense to decline by $10 million between the first half and second half of the year. Our forecast for 2023 free cash flow remains on track for between 15% and 17% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: All right. Let's go to Slide 8. Here, we show the growth in margin outlook by segment for 2023 that are underpinned by our current bookings and backlog trends. I'll make a few summary comments before I jump into the segments. First, our lead times have largely normalized across the portfolio. We highlighted in the chart our good backlog levels are primarily driven by a handful of operating businesses that are either a long cycle in nature or experience -- are experiencing secular growth where there is a supply-demand deficit or both. Next, our expectation going into the year was that order rates would normalize in an orderly fashion because the repaired supply chains, removed the rationale for customers to order for in advance. Order rates in the first quarter were strong across most businesses which is a positive indicator for our full year revenue targets, which do not require us to -- which do not require book-to-bill above one every quarter due to the aforementioned backlogs. We expect growth in Engineered Products to remain solid, driven by pricing carryover as well as pent-up demand and improved chassis availability in refuse collection vehicles. We expect trading conditions in aerospace and defense, industrial automation and which is to remain constructive following two years of excellent volume growth, we expect vehicle aftermarket to be stable. Engineered Products are set to improve margins in 2023 on solid volumes benefits from our recent productivity capital investments taking hold and positive price cost tailwinds. Clean Energy and fueling should grow low single digits organically, and solid demand in all businesses except aboveground dispensers, the constructive booking rates and customer sentiment in the dispenser business point to improvement from here with Q2 being the last quarter of negative EMV mix impact. For the year, we expect margin improvement in Clean Energy and Fueling volume recovery, improved mix, proactive restructuring actions in aboveground fueling and we expect revenue and absolute earnings growth to be entirely second half weighted for this segment as EMV volume comps fade. Imaging and ID is expected to continue its mid-single-digit growth trajectory through the year. We see robust demand for our printers, consumables and professional services and the outlook for our software offerings is also strong after some recent customer wins. Full year margins should remain attractive for this segment. We project flat organic growth for the year in Pumps & Process Solutions. Quoting activity remains strong in industrial pumps, the plastics and polymers business continues to deliver against record backlog levels with particular strength in the U.S. and in China, the Witte Pumps acquisition provides much-needed capacity to our MOD business. Demand for engineered bearings and compressor components remains robust with a notable mix in order rates towards energy transition markets, such as hydrogen, LNG and carbon capture. Thermal connector continues to grow well into the double digits. In biopharma, we expect the business to remain at current conditions in the second quarter and return to growth in the second half of the year as order rates continue to improve. As we discussed during the Analyst Day, the long-term tailwinds for single-use components for biological drug manufacturing are robust. Our full year margin target for this segment is approximately 30%. The growth outlook for climate and sustainability technologies is solid as our businesses continue to ship against strong backlog levels. We are forecasting continued double-digit growth in both natural refrigerant systems and heat exchanges for heat pumps. We expect some second quarter headwinds in refrigeration cases due to the aforementioned debooking impacting fixed cost absorption, but we remain constructive on the overall demand and continue to expect our multiyear journey of margin improvement for the business. Beverage can making is booked for the next several quarters, and we have some very interesting opportunities in the pipeline. We expect continued margin improvement in 2023 on volume conversion, productivity gains and mix. Go to Slide 9. Here, we show the range of new-to-market products and the status of some of our important expansion projects that allow us to sustain our competitive advantages in our marketplaces. We are very bullish on the long-term value creation opportunity for these new product launches. You'll see each of these products touch sustainability, digitization or biopharma and hygienic applications. Our growth and capacity expansion projects are progressing well, whether behind our heat exchangers, natural refrigerant systems or biopharma businesses. Each of these applications are growing in double digits. Over the long term, these will be important drivers of our underappreciated organic growth story. Our previously announced restructuring within the retail fueling segment is on track as we transform this business model. We also took some incremental footprint restructuring actions in retail fueling in Europe in the first quarter, and we have several ongoing projects across other operating companies as well. Let's wrap up on Slide 10. Dover's portfolio consists of a range of niche middle market industrial franchises with significant diversification from a product and end market exposure perspective, many of which we believe are secular growth tailwinds. Our supply chains are not overly complicated, and our manufacturing operations are lean and getting leaner. We believe our diverse end market exposure together with our flexible operating model and value-added center-led initiatives will continue to be a competitive advantage for us regardless of the macroeconomic environment. We believe that we have line of sight for our full year forecast and a range of available cost levers to ensure we deliver. With that, so -- with that, we are maintaining our full year 2023 guidance. So Jack, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Rich, as Brad pointed out, if you get these inventories normalize, the cash comes through, you delever pretty quickly. I just wonder what you're seeing on the M&A side of the equation and are there things that are actionable in the pipeline in 2023 in your view? And also just wonder if you'd comment on potential interest in Carrier's refrigeration business, which [indiscernible] on us this morning.\nRichard Tobin: I'll take the second one first. I know, I think it's just a purchase, I would say no, but I think that's early days to see what happens in the space. Any activity in the space in total is interesting. I'll leave it at that. In terms of M&A, yes, we took some cost in Q1 around inorganic activity. So, I guess that's an indication that we're working on some things that we hope to get across the line. I can tell you, overall, there's not a lot coming to market for all the reasons we can understand. But the good news is that multiples are now converged with the public markets and the competitiveness or lack of PE participation is helpful. So more to come, but I think that we're pleased with what we got going on in the pipeline.\nJeff Sprague: And then just on this debooking, I mean, are you seeing any other signs that retailers are just wavering either on new stores or remodeling or do you think this is truly a one-off? And I think you said you expect it to actually rebook at some point later in the year.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. This was more of a one particular customer basically revisiting strategically what their intent is. So it's our customer. We expect that process to take somewhere between four to six months, and at that point, we go back. It just wasn't -- we could have kicked the can here and just left it in backlog, but then it becomes a problem in terms of inventory in our planning process. So we just took the -- we just made the decision just to debook it out of backlog, it is a one-off. I mean, right now, what I'm hearing -- what we're hearing from our clients is, again, they're still having trouble getting the labor. They're still unhappy with the inflation cost of doing their builds, but they'd continue to like to do the build. So the demand is still strong. This one is just a strategic issue as opposed to kind of an overall commentary on the market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just talk about the -- what you expect to see here in the second quarter? I think you made some comments in the 10-Q about some of the organic growth rates. It seems like everything is relatively stable, but then we have to take into account the debooking in the refrigeration business. Is that roughly how we should think about organic growth in the second quarter? I know the comps are kind of all over the place these days, but maybe just a little color on the sequential trend there.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean I think that we would have expected to build some of that product in Q2. So, that's a bit of a headwind there. But quite frankly, the bigger issue for Q2 is the last remaining quarter of bio and EMV. So to me, Q2 is always going to be, from a comp point of view, sort of like Q1 to a certain extent, but we really feel good about the back half of the year because the comps roll forward and all of the bottom below the line charges, call it that, for a lack of a better word, actually roll positive. So yes, I mean, Q2 should look a lot like Q1 relative comp to comp.\nSteve Tusa: Relative comp to comp, but I mean absolute you usually do step up quarter-to-quarter like just on an absolute EPS basis? I mean, are we assuming normally -- should we take normal seasonality and just subtract the door cancellation?\nRichard Tobin: No, I mean, I wouldn't get too hung up on trying to monetize the math on the door cancellation. It is a bit of a headwind in Q2. What I'm saying is, if you look at Q1 to Q1, Q2 is going to be similar in terms of Q2 to Q2 comp. There's a step up in volume there.\nBrad Cerepak: Yes. So, I would say the historical first half to second half is not applicable at this stage. It's a little bit more to the back half as we said before, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. That makes sense. And then, Rich, you've been among -- sorry, just on price cost. Any update there for the year? What are you guys seeing on those numbers?\nRichard Tobin: I think we're not really taking any more meaningful price action. I mean, I think in certain areas, yes, but I mean, I think we're happy to just continue to get what's already baked into the system.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. So you're positive, though, on a price cost spread basis?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I mean, our expectation is to be positive for the full year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Rich, so, I know how much you love talking about orders, but let's do that. If we exclude the order reversal in climate, your book-to-bill was over 1 in Q1, and you're on pace for an order number, closer to $8 billion in the numbers we discussed last quarter. I think you said that order lead times have already mostly normalized. So at this point, is it looking more likely that you'll not go back to that sort of more normalized backlog at least this year and the book-to-bill may remain healthier than you previously thought?\nRichard Tobin: Oh, boy. Orders in Q1 were better than we had modeled. And interestingly, just to give a little color of it, it was all in March. So it was tracking the way that we thought it was going to track. We would expect it to be below one in Q1 just because of the size of the backlog and the non need to order so far in advance, but March was very healthy. So it's early days. If that pace keeps up, that's great for our full year volume forecast, but like I said before in the comments, we don't need to be above one every quarter for the balance of the year to hit our numbers. So, it's early days. I think that overall, we're pleased with the book-to-bill of Q1 because it's a little bit better than expected. Remember, but you have to recall, remember numerator and denominator Q2 and Q3, we step up on the shipment side, right? So you need almost a greater inflection of orders to stay above one from there. So, we'll see how it goes, but will take better-than-expected book-to-bill in Q1 [indiscernible].\nAndy Kaplowitz: Yes, that's helpful, Rich. And then maybe just on CST, again, you obviously still have very high backlog coverage. Even with the debooking. So when you look at the business, I know you're still forecasting mid-single-digit growth about the Q2 issue. But is that mid-single-digit growth really more of a minimum given sort of the capacity additions you've got and the strength in heat exchangers and CO2 systems? And how durable is the growth you think as you go forward, even if economic conditions get a little more difficult?\nRichard Tobin: Well, we're very prospective on the CO2 systems and on the heat exchanger side, which is the reason that we're expanding capacity. So that capacity is going to take basically the balance of the year to progressively come online. We probably could sell some of that capacity if it was in place now, but we think that we still in the March in terms of our capacity build versus our competitors there. So, we're bringing it online as fast as we can, but you can't sacrifice quality, and there's a variety of other things that you need to do to get it done. The swing factor will be, as I mentioned in the comments, that we have some interesting projects in Belvac, which we would expected Belvac to cycle down some in Q2, which I think we talked about at the beginning of the year. If we were able to book that, that would be a positive in terms of back-end growth. And look, at the end of the day, we expect to rebook the refrigeration business in the second half of the year. But I will tell you that, that cost structure of that business is much more flexible than it's been in the past. So even if we were to miss a little bit in terms of the top line growth there, I don't think that we're going to see the margin dilution that you would have seen historically.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: So first question, I guess, maybe just following up on Andy's question on orders. Rich, what's the price positively in March from an order standpoint?\nRichard Tobin: North American dispensers, I think was a positive surprise, and we wouldn't -- we were not expecting that to inflect until the back half of the year. Heat exchangers, I mean, I think that if we really wanted to go get the orders now, we could basically book the balance of the year in terms of backlog. That's been good. Printing ID, if you look at the performance of Q1 has been excellent. I mean that's a business that I don't think anybody models an 8% growth rate there at some really good margins. So, I mean it's broad-based in the portfolio. I think what we're most pleased with, I guess, is that biopharma inflected, right? Because we -- you see our customers now reporting their earnings of the week. We were kind of three quarters in front of everybody else in the destocking. So, we feel good about basically this inflecting in the second half of the year. And I think that we've had a more positive view, I think, on retail fueling then, I guess, the market would expect and if March orders are a precursor, I think we feel good about our full year estimates.\nJoe Ritchie: Awesome. No, that's great. And it's a good segue into biopharma, right? So, it seems like you're probably at a trough margin for the segment in 1Q, I think you're still expecting the margins for the year to be pretty much flat year-over-year versus last year. So that would imply a pretty significant improvement from here. How do you think about the cadence of that improvement over the coming quarters?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I mean, the negative comp is less so in Q2 than Q1. It was pretty significant in Q1, as you can see from the margin performance. It's still negative in Q2 and it reflects positively in the second half. The interesting part about it is we really never lost operating margin on the lower volume. We actually preserved margins. We just lost all of the volume and all the gross margin associated with that volume. So more interesting thing about targeting 30% for the full year is the balance of that segment is growing very well, and it's dilutive to biopharma. So to get to 30%, it does -- it's interesting that if those parts of the portfolio grow significantly or at least stay on the track that they're on right now, we probably have a little bit of difficulty to reach 30% just because of the portfolio effect of the segment itself. But better news is, we've been waiting now, but biopharma looks like it turns from a headwind at the half to a tailwind going forward, and we'd expect that tailwind to be material in '24.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Brad, a question. Now that you guys are a HVAC heat pump company, or can we just talk about swap a little bit? I think Carrier just talked about the market tripling for European heat pumps, you've highlighted swap capacity additions in one of the key areas for expansion for your company. You highlighted order upside in this business. Do you guys have enough capacity to keep up with this tripling of the market? And how do you see -- I know that you and Alfa Laval sort of at the top of the market right now? How do you see sort of incremental competition sort of coming in and screwing up this market?\nRichard Tobin: We have not had the time to digest what Carrier put out there in terms of the marketplace. So, I'll take a pause on that. We -- but we have been participating in the growth of the European heat pump market now for several years. I think that we are proactive in terms of building out our capacity. As we mentioned, we -- our target is to increase capacity early in '24 by 50% for SWEP. So part of winning share is to have the available capacity at the right product quality at the right price point. So that's all we can do. So we would expect that we'll be, we'll receive part of whatever estimates you want to make about what the future is in terms of heat pump growth from here, but we don't think it's just a European phenomenon. We'd expect that technology to be adopted progressively over the balance of the world driven a lot by regulation and that's why we're not just expanding our capacity in Europe, we've actually expanded in Asia and the United States also.\nAndrew Obin: And just the question, you would agree with you on the impact of order rates, supply chain normalization and order rates. It does seem you're starting to release working capital. Where are you just in your broader thinking about the balance between the state of economy credit availability and just brought -- I'm not asking about Dover, I'm not asking about Dover order rates, right, but just order rates for industrial economy as a whole because I think you have sort of great insights over the past 24 months about the entire dynamic?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I can't remember the Sammy Hagar song about like one foot on the gas and one on the brake. That's the way we're trying to run it here, right. That meaning that there's a lot of macro uncertainty in the marketplace, we think that we've got some tailwinds. But we can't just be blind, of not watching our own balance sheet. And quite frankly, we've been carrying excess inventory for two years around here. So, it was natural for us to kind of liquidate. Our watch points are the businesses that we have that are subject to constriction in credit. So to pick one and not to be overtly negative here, I mean, our car wash business requires is largely driven in a certain way of entrepreneurs getting loans and building out carwash. Well, the fact of the matter is that credit is going to be tightened. Now, does that open up the door for our big retail clients to now meaningfully move into the carwash space? We'll see. So, there's a lot of moving parts here. At the end of the day, my personal view, it's going to be a consumer driven recession, and in which I think that we're going to get. I think, whether that negativity is fully offset by the amount of capital that is going into kind of the regulatory regime or reshoring or a variety of other tailwinds that we talked about during the Investor Day, our position right now is, yes, all right. But that implies really no degradation of the macro in a meaningful way from here kind of like a slow let the air out of a balloon as opposed to a shock. So, we're going to have a management meeting here as soon as this Q&A is done, and part of what we're going to do is basically go business by business and say, all right, what's your plan to meet your numbers for the year and what's your plan, if we run into trouble, right. We've got we have no choice but to run the corporation that way.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.\nMike Halloran: By the way nice -- I Can't Drive 55 Sammy Hagar restaurant, anyways, maybe just following up on that last question there. How are you guys thinking about the or what are you seeing on the larger CapEx side from the what, later cycle, longer cycle type stuff? Are you seeing any change in the purchase patterns there? And obviously, that's not the climate at the booking but any real change on that side or anything notable?\nRichard Tobin: Well, we're modeled in a reduction in CapEx in beverage can make, right after going we had a pretty good three-year run of a lot of build out there and if you go look at what the big can makers are saying they're kind of pausing and getting their footing together. But that was modeled into our forecasts. And heat pumps, I think, the issues is your, so we'll leave that alone for the time being. On the retail fuelling side, it's actually the amount of negativity around that I think is overcooked, because we do see a lot of CapEx still there. We still expect a lot of consolidation there, which drives CapEx when those retail operations are, you basically have taking smaller stations and building much more larger complex stations, which is good for us. But Mike at the end of the day, plastics in terms of raw production of capacity expansion, particularly in Asia and North America is quite good despite energy costs moving up a little bit. So, the watch points for us is more credit tightness and how that affects CapEx for kind of not for big OEMs but for kind of like the second layer, that's where we think there may be some tightness.\nMike Halloran: No, that makes sense. And on the flip side of that coin on the short cycle side and trends on that side been relatively stable from a seasonality perspective or any real movement there?\nRichard Tobin: It's been relatively stable.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: One point I just wanted to check in on was on DEP, which I don't think has got much attention yet. But you had a very good margin expansion year-on-year, in the first quarter down sequentially. Just trying to understand sort of as we think about margins for the year that they're growing, I think for the year as a whole. Is that all kind of first half loaded? Do you think we should see decent margin expansion as you move through the year? And is the sort of the flattish vehicle aftermarket guide, does that have any margin impact or it's a sort of similar margin to the segment?\nRichard Tobin: The margins should go up into Q4. So you're rightly, if you go back and look at Q4 margin, we would expect Q1 margin that come down solely on production performance. So, we would expect it to come down but from a comp point of view from here, we'd expect to have accretive margins up until Q4 and then we'll see how we end the year because I think our margins are quite robust. On the vehicle, calling that market flat, right, so it's not a negative in terms of consolidated margin from the segment instead that's more of a top line comment, as opposed to a margin comment.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then, just my follow up, I know you tried to give some Q2 commentary when prompted and in the spirit of letting no good deed go unpunished. We've had a lot of questions on your second quarter sort of commentary. So, I just wondered if you could put any kind -- fully understand you do not guide quarterly, but I don't know if there was any finer point you could put on that second quarter color, you kind of saying that EPS in Q1 was up low single digit year on year, and so the second quarter doesn't look too different from that year on year performance?\nRichard Tobin: I think it's more Julian of the performance in terms of revenue and margin looks, comp to comp looks similar. Now, having said that, we had an $0.08 of EPS headwind of kind of below the line segment headwinds, which we believe dissipates. So I don't want to get into EPS accretion guidance quarter to quarter, but we did it. So, it looks -- if you look at Q2, if you look at the performance, relative performance Q1 to Q1 comp and do the same for Q2 to Q2 comp, it should look similar probably without some of the headwind that we saw on the below the line items.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: A lot of territories been covered here, so I don't want to beat a dead horse. But Rich, would it be fair to say, you know, you said earlier that better than expected book-to-bill in the quarter that that comment is clear, but was it also better than expected price in that book-to-bill in the quarter? I mean, piecing it together, it sounds like the answer's yes, but I haven't explicitly heard you say that.\nRichard Tobin: No, but the price that we have, the price that the accretion from price overall is just peanut buttered over what we see the sequential revenue growth is for the full year. And so, it's not as if we've put new pricing out there. And so that book-to-bill is kind of more accretive that what we have modeled, at the end of the day, I'd have to go back and take a look in terms of mix but as you can imagine around here, calculating mix effect on that many revenue streams is a bit difficult. But, overall, Scott, it was, we knew we were carrying big backlogs into '23 and we knew, and our customers knew that our lead times were coming down quite a bit. So we would expect it kind of to do more of a bleed off of not necessarily the backlog, but it would reflect it in the lower order rates. But you know, like I said, in March we had a pretty good inflection in terms of orders, which allowed us to get above one because as I mentioned with the back, what we've got modeled in for backlog depletion. We don't need to be above one this year and that's why we're trying to kind of coach everybody into, let's not panic if we don't do above one. We don't need to be above one to hit our numbers.\nScott Davis: Yes, that's clear. Okay. I'm going to keep it at that guys. You answered everything else. I appreciate it and best of luck.\nRichard Tobin: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Rich, just on that comment on March in terms of the booking rates being better, can you put that in context of these lead time improvements? And what you would expect it to be kind of in the opposite direction. Was that surprise really in these longer cycle or longer lead time businesses where maybe folks were kind of waiting to see what they wanted to do or waiting to see what that supply chain impact was and then came back? Or was it in the more like shorter cycle economically sensitive stuff?\nRichard Tobin: Both, right. So, you had positive inflection and biopharma that we talked about. I think, retail fueling inflected positively, which is a good sign. But on the longest cycle side, plastics and polymers, which is a long cycle business booked very well. And we expect it to book very well again in Q2. So, it's both I mean, at the end of the day. So -- but we haven't even had the time to dissect it order by order. But I can tell you just in terms of it's not overly short cycle and it's an -- exclusively short cycle, because there is an element of long cycle in there, which you're going to see probably in our backlogs by the time we close Q2.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: And then just on climate and sustainability, I think there's some decent mix within mix there. And maybe just to avoid, something like what happened in Pumps & Process. Is there a quarter that you can see coming or a period of time where you would expect, some outsize mix effect to show up or should we just see kind of the steady progression we've seen thus far?\nRichard Tobin: I think everybody overestimates the margin in Belvac, which is accommodated into our forecast for the full year beginning because as we mentioned. We've been kind of transparent about what the cycle was there. We would expect to see some kind of fade there, but it's not something that we can't mop up because CO2 systems and heat exchanger margins are at minimum flat to what we get in beverage can making.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas.\nBrett Linzey: First question just on Pumps & Process. Good to see some stabilization there in biopharma. Just curious how we should think about the mixed benefit on the other side here obviously some sequential improvement through the year, but thinking about next year, I mean, we're going to be expanding back into that 32% to 33% level?\nRichard Tobin: That's pretty aggressive. Look, at the end of the day, as I mentioned, we actually did not give up margin going down. We just gave up the mix effect of that reduced volume on the segment itself. All I can tell you is we would expect on the way back up that from a margin mix point of view, it's clearly positive. And that's why I think that we're sitting, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're trying our best to get to 30 for the full year, which implies some amount of positive. We know we have the compound positivity, but it implies some amount of growth in the second half of the year at some healthy biopharma margin. But more importantly as we went through in the Investor Day, if we strip out the COVID, the core business is growing 20%. So, if we get some growth in the back end, it's margin accretive and as we roll into '24, if we can keep on that trajectory then it becomes meaningful in terms of absolute profits and margin. But what I don't want to do is to tuck down the growth rates of the rest of the segment from a mix point of view because if they grow significantly themselves and you're going to have a little bit of a margin mix drag, but in absolute profits will take it.\nBrett Linzey: And then just on Slide 9, you called out the ongoing restructuring actions, I think 14 million in the first quarter. Where are you in terms of right sizing efforts? Do you think you're in a pretty good spot in terms of capacity lined with deliverables? Or is there more to do there?\nRichard Tobin: In fueling solutions, I think that we're probably 90% there. We've taken a bunch of cost out last year, and then we took some further actions this year. So, the management team is doing a real good job of kind of getting their arms around positioning the cost structure of that business based on what we believe that demand is and the business model is going to be going from here. Having said that, the balance of the portfolio as opportunity in it, and I think if you go back and read the comments, I think I wrote into the fact that we would expect some further footprint actions to go on. And I think you'll begin to see some of that this year.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. The top bridge shows organic revenue growth of 3%, driven by increases in three of our five segments. Acquisitions contributed $19 million to the top line in the quarter. FX translation was a substantial headwind at 2.5% and or $52 million and impacted both our revenue growth and profitability. FX headwinds resulted in $0.06 of negative EPS impact in the quarter. At today's prevailing rates, we expect these FX headwinds to subside as the year progresses against easier comps with roughly $0.10 of negative FX impact forecasted for the first half of the year and $0.05 of favorability in the second half. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was up 3% organically in the quarter. Europe and Asia were flat and down 4%, respectively, on timing, of comparable shipments. We expect organic growth in both regions for the full year. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to foreign currency translation, normalization of lead times across several businesses and a $90 million order de-booking related to a major retail refrigeration customer's decision to temporarily pause its new store expansion program. Now let's move to cash flow on Slide 7. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $193 million or 9% of revenue. This represents a record first quarter free cash flow and was up over $200 million year-over-year. The first quarter is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of investments in working capital to support growth in the year ahead. As discussed previously, our supply chains -- with supply chains improving, we have been actively working to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023 and we are beginning to see the results materialize. We expect our working capital balances and particularly our inventories to reduce over the balance of the year and to be a significant driver of year-over-year cash flow. Excluding any impacts from acquisitions, we should materially pay down commercial paper balances over the next several quarters. As a result, we would expect interest expense to decline by $10 million between the first half and second half of the year. Our forecast for 2023 free cash flow remains on track for between 15% and 17% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich. Yes. So, I would say the historical first half to second half is not applicable at this stage. It's a little bit more to the back half as we said before, Steve."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everybody. Let's start with the performance highlights on Slide 3. The quarter was solid overall. We are very pleased with our production performance to start the year which allowed us to begin reducing our inventory balances towards the end of the quarter. Consolidated organic revenue was up 3%, with growth across most of our businesses driven largely by the secular growth tailwinds that we outlined at our most recent Investor Day. The majority of our input and supply chain constraints have dissipated, resulting in production lead times largely returning to pre-pandemic levels. This has led to more normalized order patterns, improved shipping volumes and a gradual reduction of elevated backlog. New order intake was robust in the quarter with four out of five segments posting book-to-bill of one. New bookings increased sequentially in the first quarter, and our order backlog remains elevated compared to normal levels providing us with good visibility for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we de-booked some volume from our backlog and retail refrigeration from a single customer, was put the timing of 2023 capital plan under review. Our expectation is that we'll be rebooking the volume in the second half. Margin performance in the quarter was strong with four out of our five segments improving margins over 100 basis points, driven by broad-based productivity gains, positive price/cost dynamics and prior period investments and cost containment actions. Higher segment earnings performance drove our EPS growth. We had some comparable cost headwinds during the quarter from transitory inorganic activity costs, higher interest expense, FX and tax. Brad will review later. Interest costs are set to drop progressively for the balance of the year and FX at current rates turns into a comparable tailwind in the back half. Our recent investments in automation and productivity projects are paying off, and we are in the process of completing several capacity expansions in our secular growth businesses. The acquisition of Witte in our Pumps & Process Solutions segment, which we completed in December last year is off to a great start and is performing above expectations. Our strong financial position allows us to pursue a healthy pipeline of attractive bolt-on acquisitions and to opportunistically return capital to our shareholders. We are encouraged by the trends and performance so far in 2023. We have a constructive but also watchful outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, demand conditions in our attractive industrial markets remain solid and our bookings are healthy. Our order backlogs, especially in our longer-cycle businesses provide good visibility to our forecast. We are on track to deliver our full year cash flow target as we liquidate inventory in concert with the normalization of our backlog. We are mindful of the mix to macro economic backdrop, and we are staying close to our customers to understand their plans. We have available cost control levers and operational flexibility that should enable us to deliver good results in various macroeconomic environments. With that, we maintain our 2023 full year guidance, 3% to 5% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $8.85 to $9.05 per share. I'll skip Slide 4. Let's move on to the segments. Engineered Products was up 3% organically in the quarter, driven by positive pricing, strong demand for waste handling equipment parts and related digital services. The chassis availability issues that impacted the waste handling business coming out of the pandemic have improved. And to the extent that, that supply continues to be available, we are well positioned to increase shipments meaningfully against strong underlying demand. Margins were up 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by improving supply chains, positive price cost dynamics, mix and as well as investments in productivity initiatives. Clean Energy and Fueling declined by 3% on an organic basis. Revenue is up in clean energy components, vehicle wash, fuel transport and below-ground retail fueling, offset by the expected comparable decline in dispenser and EMV card reader demand. The upcoming second quarter comp is the last of material EMV volume. We remain constructive on the business for the full year as order activity in March was healthy. Despite the lower volume, margins in the quarter were up 120 basis points on positive mix and price cost as well as improved comparable cost structure from previously announced cost reduction actions taken in the retail fueling business. Imaging and ID posted a solid quarter, up 8% organically on broad-based strength in our marking and coding printers, spare parts and consumables. Our serialization software business continues to perform well and win new accounts. FX remained a negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in this segment that drove a large base of non-U.S. dollar revenue. Margins in Imaging and ID were very strong at 24%, improving 260 basis points on volume, conversion, pricing actions and mix. Pumps & Process Solutions declined 7% organically in the quarter, driven principally by the post-COVID transition in the biopharma space. New orders for biopharma grew sequentially during the quarter as the impacts from inventory destocking begin to subside. At the current trajectory, we expect to have one more quarter of headwinds then inflect positively in the second half of the year. All the other businesses in this segment posted solid organic growth during the quarter with particular strength in precision components, industrial pumps, thermal connectors and polymer processing equipment. Operating margin was down against a peak comparable quarter in the prior year due to the mix effect from higher non-biopharma revenue. Top line and Climate and Sustainable Technologies continued its double-digit growth trajectory from the last two years, posting 16% organic growth. Demand trends remain particularly robust in heat exchangers and CO2 refrigeration systems, driven by global investments in sustainability. Beverage can making continued shipping deliveries against its strong backlog. Margins came in at 16% in the quarter, up 280 basis points year-over-year on strong volume conversion, productivity, positive price/cost and good mix of products delivered. I'll pass it to Brad here. All right. Let's go to Slide 8. Here, we show the growth in margin outlook by segment for 2023 that are underpinned by our current bookings and backlog trends. I'll make a few summary comments before I jump into the segments. First, our lead times have largely normalized across the portfolio. We highlighted in the chart our good backlog levels are primarily driven by a handful of operating businesses that are either a long cycle in nature or experience -- are experiencing secular growth where there is a supply-demand deficit or both. Next, our expectation going into the year was that order rates would normalize in an orderly fashion because the repaired supply chains, removed the rationale for customers to order for in advance. Order rates in the first quarter were strong across most businesses which is a positive indicator for our full year revenue targets, which do not require us to -- which do not require book-to-bill above one every quarter due to the aforementioned backlogs. We expect growth in Engineered Products to remain solid, driven by pricing carryover as well as pent-up demand and improved chassis availability in refuse collection vehicles. We expect trading conditions in aerospace and defense, industrial automation and which is to remain constructive following two years of excellent volume growth, we expect vehicle aftermarket to be stable. Engineered Products are set to improve margins in 2023 on solid volumes benefits from our recent productivity capital investments taking hold and positive price cost tailwinds. Clean Energy and fueling should grow low single digits organically, and solid demand in all businesses except aboveground dispensers, the constructive booking rates and customer sentiment in the dispenser business point to improvement from here with Q2 being the last quarter of negative EMV mix impact. For the year, we expect margin improvement in Clean Energy and Fueling volume recovery, improved mix, proactive restructuring actions in aboveground fueling and we expect revenue and absolute earnings growth to be entirely second half weighted for this segment as EMV volume comps fade. Imaging and ID is expected to continue its mid-single-digit growth trajectory through the year. We see robust demand for our printers, consumables and professional services and the outlook for our software offerings is also strong after some recent customer wins. Full year margins should remain attractive for this segment. We project flat organic growth for the year in Pumps & Process Solutions. Quoting activity remains strong in industrial pumps, the plastics and polymers business continues to deliver against record backlog levels with particular strength in the U.S. and in China, the Witte Pumps acquisition provides much-needed capacity to our MOD business. Demand for engineered bearings and compressor components remains robust with a notable mix in order rates towards energy transition markets, such as hydrogen, LNG and carbon capture. Thermal connector continues to grow well into the double digits. In biopharma, we expect the business to remain at current conditions in the second quarter and return to growth in the second half of the year as order rates continue to improve. As we discussed during the Analyst Day, the long-term tailwinds for single-use components for biological drug manufacturing are robust. Our full year margin target for this segment is approximately 30%. The growth outlook for climate and sustainability technologies is solid as our businesses continue to ship against strong backlog levels. We are forecasting continued double-digit growth in both natural refrigerant systems and heat exchanges for heat pumps. We expect some second quarter headwinds in refrigeration cases due to the aforementioned debooking impacting fixed cost absorption, but we remain constructive on the overall demand and continue to expect our multiyear journey of margin improvement for the business. Beverage can making is booked for the next several quarters, and we have some very interesting opportunities in the pipeline. We expect continued margin improvement in 2023 on volume conversion, productivity gains and mix. Go to Slide 9. Here, we show the range of new-to-market products and the status of some of our important expansion projects that allow us to sustain our competitive advantages in our marketplaces. We are very bullish on the long-term value creation opportunity for these new product launches. You'll see each of these products touch sustainability, digitization or biopharma and hygienic applications. Our growth and capacity expansion projects are progressing well, whether behind our heat exchangers, natural refrigerant systems or biopharma businesses. Each of these applications are growing in double digits. Over the long term, these will be important drivers of our underappreciated organic growth story. Our previously announced restructuring within the retail fueling segment is on track as we transform this business model. We also took some incremental footprint restructuring actions in retail fueling in Europe in the first quarter, and we have several ongoing projects across other operating companies as well. Let's wrap up on Slide 10. Dover's portfolio consists of a range of niche middle market industrial franchises with significant diversification from a product and end market exposure perspective, many of which we believe are secular growth tailwinds. Our supply chains are not overly complicated, and our manufacturing operations are lean and getting leaner. We believe our diverse end market exposure together with our flexible operating model and value-added center-led initiatives will continue to be a competitive advantage for us regardless of the macroeconomic environment. We believe that we have line of sight for our full year forecast and a range of available cost levers to ensure we deliver. With that, so -- with that, we are maintaining our full year 2023 guidance. So Jack, let's go to Q&A. I'll take the second one first. I know, I think it's just a purchase, I would say no, but I think that's early days to see what happens in the space. Any activity in the space in total is interesting. I'll leave it at that. In terms of M&A, yes, we took some cost in Q1 around inorganic activity. So, I guess that's an indication that we're working on some things that we hope to get across the line. I can tell you, overall, there's not a lot coming to market for all the reasons we can understand. But the good news is that multiples are now converged with the public markets and the competitiveness or lack of PE participation is helpful. So more to come, but I think that we're pleased with what we got going on in the pipeline. Yes. This was more of a one particular customer basically revisiting strategically what their intent is. So it's our customer. We expect that process to take somewhere between four to six months, and at that point, we go back. It just wasn't -- we could have kicked the can here and just left it in backlog, but then it becomes a problem in terms of inventory in our planning process. So we just took the -- we just made the decision just to debook it out of backlog, it is a one-off. I mean, right now, what I'm hearing -- what we're hearing from our clients is, again, they're still having trouble getting the labor. They're still unhappy with the inflation cost of doing their builds, but they'd continue to like to do the build. So the demand is still strong. This one is just a strategic issue as opposed to kind of an overall commentary on the market. Yes. I mean I think that we would have expected to build some of that product in Q2. So, that's a bit of a headwind there. But quite frankly, the bigger issue for Q2 is the last remaining quarter of bio and EMV. So to me, Q2 is always going to be, from a comp point of view, sort of like Q1 to a certain extent, but we really feel good about the back half of the year because the comps roll forward and all of the bottom below the line charges, call it that, for a lack of a better word, actually roll positive. So yes, I mean, Q2 should look a lot like Q1 relative comp to comp. No, I mean, I wouldn't get too hung up on trying to monetize the math on the door cancellation. It is a bit of a headwind in Q2. What I'm saying is, if you look at Q1 to Q1, Q2 is going to be similar in terms of Q2 to Q2 comp. There's a step up in volume there. I think we're not really taking any more meaningful price action. I mean, I think in certain areas, yes, but I mean, I think we're happy to just continue to get what's already baked into the system. Yes, I mean, our expectation is to be positive for the full year. Oh, boy. Orders in Q1 were better than we had modeled. And interestingly, just to give a little color of it, it was all in March. So it was tracking the way that we thought it was going to track. We would expect it to be below one in Q1 just because of the size of the backlog and the non need to order so far in advance, but March was very healthy. So it's early days. If that pace keeps up, that's great for our full year volume forecast, but like I said before in the comments, we don't need to be above one every quarter for the balance of the year to hit our numbers. So, it's early days. I think that overall, we're pleased with the book-to-bill of Q1 because it's a little bit better than expected. Remember, but you have to recall, remember numerator and denominator Q2 and Q3, we step up on the shipment side, right? So you need almost a greater inflection of orders to stay above one from there. So, we'll see how it goes, but will take better-than-expected book-to-bill in Q1 [indiscernible]. Well, we're very prospective on the CO2 systems and on the heat exchanger side, which is the reason that we're expanding capacity. So that capacity is going to take basically the balance of the year to progressively come online. We probably could sell some of that capacity if it was in place now, but we think that we still in the March in terms of our capacity build versus our competitors there. So, we're bringing it online as fast as we can, but you can't sacrifice quality, and there's a variety of other things that you need to do to get it done. The swing factor will be, as I mentioned in the comments, that we have some interesting projects in Belvac, which we would expected Belvac to cycle down some in Q2, which I think we talked about at the beginning of the year. If we were able to book that, that would be a positive in terms of back-end growth. And look, at the end of the day, we expect to rebook the refrigeration business in the second half of the year. But I will tell you that, that cost structure of that business is much more flexible than it's been in the past. So even if we were to miss a little bit in terms of the top line growth there, I don't think that we're going to see the margin dilution that you would have seen historically. North American dispensers, I think was a positive surprise, and we wouldn't -- we were not expecting that to inflect until the back half of the year. Heat exchangers, I mean, I think that if we really wanted to go get the orders now, we could basically book the balance of the year in terms of backlog. That's been good. Printing ID, if you look at the performance of Q1 has been excellent. I mean that's a business that I don't think anybody models an 8% growth rate there at some really good margins. So, I mean it's broad-based in the portfolio. I think what we're most pleased with, I guess, is that biopharma inflected, right? Because we -- you see our customers now reporting their earnings of the week. We were kind of three quarters in front of everybody else in the destocking. So, we feel good about basically this inflecting in the second half of the year. And I think that we've had a more positive view, I think, on retail fueling then, I guess, the market would expect and if March orders are a precursor, I think we feel good about our full year estimates. Well, I mean, the negative comp is less so in Q2 than Q1. It was pretty significant in Q1, as you can see from the margin performance. It's still negative in Q2 and it reflects positively in the second half. The interesting part about it is we really never lost operating margin on the lower volume. We actually preserved margins. We just lost all of the volume and all the gross margin associated with that volume. So more interesting thing about targeting 30% for the full year is the balance of that segment is growing very well, and it's dilutive to biopharma. So to get to 30%, it does -- it's interesting that if those parts of the portfolio grow significantly or at least stay on the track that they're on right now, we probably have a little bit of difficulty to reach 30% just because of the portfolio effect of the segment itself. But better news is, we've been waiting now, but biopharma looks like it turns from a headwind at the half to a tailwind going forward, and we'd expect that tailwind to be material in '24. We have not had the time to digest what Carrier put out there in terms of the marketplace. So, I'll take a pause on that. We -- but we have been participating in the growth of the European heat pump market now for several years. I think that we are proactive in terms of building out our capacity. As we mentioned, we -- our target is to increase capacity early in '24 by 50% for SWEP. So part of winning share is to have the available capacity at the right product quality at the right price point. So that's all we can do. So we would expect that we'll be, we'll receive part of whatever estimates you want to make about what the future is in terms of heat pump growth from here, but we don't think it's just a European phenomenon. We'd expect that technology to be adopted progressively over the balance of the world driven a lot by regulation and that's why we're not just expanding our capacity in Europe, we've actually expanded in Asia and the United States also. Yes, I can't remember the Sammy Hagar song about like one foot on the gas and one on the brake. That's the way we're trying to run it here, right. That meaning that there's a lot of macro uncertainty in the marketplace, we think that we've got some tailwinds. But we can't just be blind, of not watching our own balance sheet. And quite frankly, we've been carrying excess inventory for two years around here. So, it was natural for us to kind of liquidate. Our watch points are the businesses that we have that are subject to constriction in credit. So to pick one and not to be overtly negative here, I mean, our car wash business requires is largely driven in a certain way of entrepreneurs getting loans and building out carwash. Well, the fact of the matter is that credit is going to be tightened. Now, does that open up the door for our big retail clients to now meaningfully move into the carwash space? We'll see. So, there's a lot of moving parts here. At the end of the day, my personal view, it's going to be a consumer driven recession, and in which I think that we're going to get. I think, whether that negativity is fully offset by the amount of capital that is going into kind of the regulatory regime or reshoring or a variety of other tailwinds that we talked about during the Investor Day, our position right now is, yes, all right. But that implies really no degradation of the macro in a meaningful way from here kind of like a slow let the air out of a balloon as opposed to a shock. So, we're going to have a management meeting here as soon as this Q&A is done, and part of what we're going to do is basically go business by business and say, all right, what's your plan to meet your numbers for the year and what's your plan, if we run into trouble, right. We've got we have no choice but to run the corporation that way. Well, we're modeled in a reduction in CapEx in beverage can make, right after going we had a pretty good three-year run of a lot of build out there and if you go look at what the big can makers are saying they're kind of pausing and getting their footing together. But that was modeled into our forecasts. And heat pumps, I think, the issues is your, so we'll leave that alone for the time being. On the retail fuelling side, it's actually the amount of negativity around that I think is overcooked, because we do see a lot of CapEx still there. We still expect a lot of consolidation there, which drives CapEx when those retail operations are, you basically have taking smaller stations and building much more larger complex stations, which is good for us. But Mike at the end of the day, plastics in terms of raw production of capacity expansion, particularly in Asia and North America is quite good despite energy costs moving up a little bit. So, the watch points for us is more credit tightness and how that affects CapEx for kind of not for big OEMs but for kind of like the second layer, that's where we think there may be some tightness. It's been relatively stable. The margins should go up into Q4. So you're rightly, if you go back and look at Q4 margin, we would expect Q1 margin that come down solely on production performance. So, we would expect it to come down but from a comp point of view from here, we'd expect to have accretive margins up until Q4 and then we'll see how we end the year because I think our margins are quite robust. On the vehicle, calling that market flat, right, so it's not a negative in terms of consolidated margin from the segment instead that's more of a top line comment, as opposed to a margin comment. I think it's more Julian of the performance in terms of revenue and margin looks, comp to comp looks similar. Now, having said that, we had an $0.08 of EPS headwind of kind of below the line segment headwinds, which we believe dissipates. So I don't want to get into EPS accretion guidance quarter to quarter, but we did it. So, it looks -- if you look at Q2, if you look at the performance, relative performance Q1 to Q1 comp and do the same for Q2 to Q2 comp, it should look similar probably without some of the headwind that we saw on the below the line items. No, but the price that we have, the price that the accretion from price overall is just peanut buttered over what we see the sequential revenue growth is for the full year. And so, it's not as if we've put new pricing out there. And so that book-to-bill is kind of more accretive that what we have modeled, at the end of the day, I'd have to go back and take a look in terms of mix but as you can imagine around here, calculating mix effect on that many revenue streams is a bit difficult. But, overall, Scott, it was, we knew we were carrying big backlogs into '23 and we knew, and our customers knew that our lead times were coming down quite a bit. So we would expect it kind of to do more of a bleed off of not necessarily the backlog, but it would reflect it in the lower order rates. But you know, like I said, in March we had a pretty good inflection in terms of orders, which allowed us to get above one because as I mentioned with the back, what we've got modeled in for backlog depletion. We don't need to be above one this year and that's why we're trying to kind of coach everybody into, let's not panic if we don't do above one. We don't need to be above one to hit our numbers. Yes, thanks. Both, right. So, you had positive inflection and biopharma that we talked about. I think, retail fueling inflected positively, which is a good sign. But on the longest cycle side, plastics and polymers, which is a long cycle business booked very well. And we expect it to book very well again in Q2. So, it's both I mean, at the end of the day. So -- but we haven't even had the time to dissect it order by order. But I can tell you just in terms of it's not overly short cycle and it's an -- exclusively short cycle, because there is an element of long cycle in there, which you're going to see probably in our backlogs by the time we close Q2. I think everybody overestimates the margin in Belvac, which is accommodated into our forecast for the full year beginning because as we mentioned. We've been kind of transparent about what the cycle was there. We would expect to see some kind of fade there, but it's not something that we can't mop up because CO2 systems and heat exchanger margins are at minimum flat to what we get in beverage can making. That's pretty aggressive. Look, at the end of the day, as I mentioned, we actually did not give up margin going down. We just gave up the mix effect of that reduced volume on the segment itself. All I can tell you is we would expect on the way back up that from a margin mix point of view, it's clearly positive. And that's why I think that we're sitting, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're trying our best to get to 30 for the full year, which implies some amount of positive. We know we have the compound positivity, but it implies some amount of growth in the second half of the year at some healthy biopharma margin. But more importantly as we went through in the Investor Day, if we strip out the COVID, the core business is growing 20%. So, if we get some growth in the back end, it's margin accretive and as we roll into '24, if we can keep on that trajectory then it becomes meaningful in terms of absolute profits and margin. But what I don't want to do is to tuck down the growth rates of the rest of the segment from a mix point of view because if they grow significantly themselves and you're going to have a little bit of a margin mix drag, but in absolute profits will take it. In fueling solutions, I think that we're probably 90% there. We've taken a bunch of cost out last year, and then we took some further actions this year. So, the management team is doing a real good job of kind of getting their arms around positioning the cost structure of that business based on what we believe that demand is and the business model is going to be going from here. Having said that, the balance of the portfolio as opportunity in it, and I think if you go back and read the comments, I think I wrote into the fact that we would expect some further footprint actions to go on. And I think you'll begin to see some of that this year."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jack Dickens, Senior Director, Investor Relations. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir.\nJack Dickens: Thank you, Connie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of the call will be available on our website through November 14th, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our presentation today is on a continuing operations basis to exclude the impact of our divested waste tolling equipment business from historical results. Please reference the 8-K filed on October 10th for further information. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the performance highlights on Page 3. Overall, the quarter was modestly better than our internal forecast, which I'll cover in the upcoming segment results slides. Top line performance was broad-based across the portfolio. We are especially pleased that the rotation from our longer cycle businesses to our growth platforms has continued to drive positive margin mix for the total portfolio. We expect that to be an underlying theme as we head into 2025. Segment margin performance for the quarter was solid at 22.6% and represents an all-time high for Dover's consolidated portfolio. Bookings were up 5% organically in the quarter with particular strength clean energy, thermal connectors, CO2 systems and biopharma components, further bolstering our positive mix outlook. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up 6% to $2.27. During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Environmental Solutions Group business, reducing our exposure to the capital goods sector. As you can see from the bottom right of the slide, the reconciliation of this impact to our full year adjusted EPS guidance from continuing operations. As a result of this transaction, we will exit 2024 with record capital deployment, firepower, providing us with a variety of value-creation opportunities going forward. Our outlook remains constructive for the balance of the year. Our third quarter performance has given us room to manage demand seasonality to drive cash flow optimization through year-end by thoughtfully managing capacity utilization. Our setup for 2025 is compelling with positive portfolio rotation into higher margin businesses as we lap easy and long cycle comps through the year. This is further augmented by our exceptional balance sheet, optionality to pursue value-creating capital deployment strategies. Let's skip to Slide 5 on segment performance. Engineered Products posted strong top line performance on volume growth in vehicle services and industrial winches. Aerospace and defense was lower in the period due to shipment timing and a difficult comparable quarter. Margin was down modestly, because of margin mix on reduced aerospace and defense volumes. Clean Energy & Fueling was down 1% organic as positive performance in clean energy components and North American retail fueling was offset by lower volumes in vehicle wash and retail fueling equipment in Europe and Asia. Bookings were positive in the quarter, as below-ground retail fueling volumes are inflecting positively along with cryogenic components. Margin was flat as favorable product mix was offset by near-term integration costs of our most recent acquisitions. We expect this dynamic to have a material positive margin swing, as we complete our integration activities through 2025. Imaging & Identification posted an excellent quarter on solid marketing and coating performance in the U.S. and Europe. New printer shipments inflected positively during the quarter, which is a good signal for customer capital spending. Margin performance was robust as management actions on cost to serve and footprint optimization continued to drive incremental margins. Pumps & Process Solutions was up 2% organically on robust shipments in thermal connectors precision components biopharma connectors and pumps, biopharma revenue is up mid-teens, year-to-date and over 30% versus the comparable quarter of the prior year. As forecasted, polymer processing equipment was down in the period. All in, Pumps & Process Solutions segment bookings were up 15% organically in the quarter as biopharma and growth platform cycles inflected positively. Segment revenue mix drove 200 basis points of margin improvement on excellent performance, production performance on volume growth in Biopharma and thermal margin mix from FW -- the FW Murphy acquisition and tight cost controls in -- in the Polymers business. Revenue was down in the quarter in Climate & Sustainability Technologies as solid demand in food retail systems was offset by tough comps, in beverage can making equipment and weak demand in the broader HVAC complex, particularly in European residential heat pumps, on our brazed plate heat exchanger business. We had hoped to see positive bookings inflection in heat exchangers in the quarter, but that was not the case. So we have taken down our forecast in the back half of the year in that business to preserve production performance for 2025. The frustrating results as we were able to hold segment margins flat despite the lower volumes due to excellent performance in our retail refrigeration business that was augmented by exceptionally good shipment rates in CO2 systems. Despite the short-term challenges, we like the setup going into 2025 based on increasing CO2 demand, where we expect bookings to inflect materially higher together with market recovery and heat exchanges, both of which are margin accretive. I'll pass it to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6, just a reminder that our presentation today is on a continuing operations basis excluding our divested Environmental Solutions Group business from the historical results. Let's go to the charts. The top bridge shows our revenue growth. The impact of acquired businesses this year more than offset the disposition of DESTACO which closed on March 31 by $21 million, while FX was basically flat. From a geographic perspective, the US, our largest market, was up 8% in the quarter on healthy broad-based demand. Europe and Asia were down 5% and 10%, respectively. China, which represents about half our revenue base in Asia was down 17% organically in the quarter, primarily due to shipment timing within polymer processing. On the bottom chart, bookings were up $90 million organically year-over-year on solid broad-based demand across most end markets. Below-the-line items were slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis in the quarter on higher corporate costs, mostly related to acquisition deal costs. Our cash flow statement is on Slide 7. Adjusting for taxes paid on the gain of DESTACO, which are non-operational in nature, our free cash flow was 17% of revenue in the quarter, up $48 million year-over-year. Year-to-date cash flow on this chart is 11% of revenue. The fourth quarter is historically our highest cash flow quarter as we expect more favorable working capital balances over the rest of the year. We are on track to deliver our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of 13% to 15% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. With that, let me turn it back to Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Brad. I'm on Slide 8. It was a busy quarter with the portfolio moves, discontinued ops and some counter cyclicality within the portfolio. As a result of that, we thought it prudent to lay the groundwork for 2025 earlier to provide some hopefully helpful views. Let's start with the portfolio. We articulated throughout the year that underlying demand across many of our end marks -- end markets is solid, and that remains the case as we look forward into 2025. With a diverse portfolio such as ours, we enter each planning cycle, constructing a view of the overall macro, the individual business cycles and our competitive position. In 2024, we had a familiar challenge much like we did in the post-COVID period navigating the biopharma demand cycle. In 2024, we managed a down cycle on the portion of our high long-cycle portfolio as well as the regulatory and stocking idiosyncrasies, cheeses and heat exchangers as shown on the right side of the page. As you can see on the slide, we managed to offset significant cycle headwind with mixing up our consolidated margin on broader short-cycle improvement augmented by our growth platforms, which we invested in both organically and inorganically. As we complete 2024 and begin forming our view for 2025, we do not receive the same counter cyclicality in the portfolio. Bookings and customer forecasts indicate that our growth platforms are in a multi-period demand cycle. We are particularly pleased with the growth rate and biopharma components, thermal connectors, precision components and CO2 systems, all with margin accretion attributes to the portfolio. We expect heat exchanges to return to growth in 2025 on the recovery heat pumps and large-format demand district heating and data center applications for which we are expanding production capacity today. Let's move to Slide 9. Organic investment, inorganic growth and shareholder-friendly capital return remain front and center to our strategy, and we have done all three so far in 2024. We have been more active on portfolio pruning this year at attractive valuations as we methodically reshaped the portfolio to higher secular growth and less cyclical end market exposures. As mentioned earlier, we will exit 2024 with significant optionality for capital deployment and/or capital return, which is reflected on the balance sheet capacity bar on the right. Let's finish up with Slide 10. I've already covered the adjusted EPS guidance to accommodate the discontinued operations earlier in the deck, which is summarized on the left. At the time of the ESG announcement, we are often asked about the assumptions needed to offset the lost earnings from divestitures in 2025. We prepared the bridge on the slide to provide some direction on the moving pieces on a pro forma basis. Let's not get too excited. We will, as always, provide formal 2025 guidance after the close of the year, but I thought it would -- I thought, but I hope that you find it to be a reasonable pro forma view that provides clarity on the moving parts. Left to right, we start with predisposal EPS from our previous guide. We treat retrospectively the disposals on a full year basis. We treat the cash balance prospectively as it ever held for the full year in the short-term in highly liquid positions where it is presently, which includes the retirement of commercial paper costs in 2024 and we roll forward the 2024 acquisitions earnings benefit. We get to a rebased 2025 EPS of $8.60 to $8.75 on a base model that assumes zero organic growth in 2025. If we model a 3% to 5% organic growth at a 40% conversion rate next year, which includes $25 million in restructuring roll forward that is already completed or underway this year. We get an additional $0.55 to $0.90 of EPS. As I mentioned earlier, we are accelerating our synergy capture from recent acquisitions, including footprint consolidation, so what I would expect the restructuring contribution to be higher in 2025. Considering what was covered in the growth platform's growth trajectory, margin mix and long cycle comparable performance that we discussed on Slide 8, the top line and incremental margin assumptions seem reasonable. Now, I certainly doubt that we'll sit on that amount of liquidity unless there is a drastic negative change in the macro. And then in that case, it is nice to have an insurance policy. Clearly, this model can be flexed for share repurchases and M&A, but the model timing is problematic. So this is a simple value view. Our preference is to be active on the M&A front. And at present, that environment is getting better. We have an interesting opportunity pipeline, but rest assured, we will proceed with the capital discipline that we have demonstrated in the past. With that, let's go to Q&A. And I won't say any of opacities or whatever. Okay. Let's go.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Thanks. We're all [indiscernible] this morning.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning, Jeff.\nBrad Cerepak: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Yes. It's early. It's early, but it feels late. Just on the comment on climate sustainability, Rich, that you made as you were going through kind of the opening comments. The comment about materially higher in 2025, was that a total segment comment, a heat pump comment? Can you just maybe elaborate on the moving pieces within that segment in particular?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean I think there was a bookings comment more than anything else. If you recall back last quarter, we had said that we would hope to have seen bookings increase in brazed plate heat exchanges for European heat pumps. That was not the case. So we have taken down our full year estimates in that particular product line. So that's negative to bookings now. We're going to take down production just to let whatever the remaining clearing event needs to take place between now and the end of the year. So we'll cut production in Q4 also in terms of the estimates. At that point, I think it's fair to say that bookings based on what we see in our forecast for 2025 demand and heat pumps should inflect positively going forward there, and in CO2 systems based on feedback that we're getting from the market in terms of spend, we would expect a material amount of bookings inflection there, whether we get it all in Q4, whether it splits between Q4 and Q1, we'll see. But based on our market read there, we think that we're going to be materially up on CO2 systems in 2025.\nJeff Sprague: And then I appreciate the bridge here, it's definitely helpful. Just thinking about that $0.50, right, that's tied to cash on hand. Obviously, the deal impact can vary depending on what you pay for stuff and the right multiples. Do you foresee a scenario where it's less than $0.50, because you're more active on the M&A front. How should we think about that?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean, and that's -- I tried to cover that in the commentary, Jeff. Look, at the end of the day, someone described that the in the bag, it would be just to sit on the liquidity and that liquidity, you can just basically say that deposit rates even with factoring in rate cuts would drive that kind of result. In my comments, I said, I don't foresee that actually happening. Now whether it's M&A or share repurchases, that math gets funky, right? Because you got to start, but we've done the models here and said, if it's margin accretive, and we paid 15 times, what does that look what does that look like? And if you close it into Q1, what does that look like? Or if we did a share repurchase of $1 billion, like? You can do those scenarios. But we just thought that optically to give you a view of it's not only the -- not 2021 anymore, where holding on to liquidity was a zero-sum game because your cost of carry was neutral, if not negative. Now, it's meaningful. And if you go back and look at our interest cost on commercial paper in 2024 and you add that back again, the gap that we have in the lost earnings is really what we're trying to show here is significantly reduced because of that carry. So, I hope and I would expect that the interest income line is going to be overstated because I would expect us to deploy M&A capital. But just as a note, that cash balance is just the proceeds and the after-tax proceeds of the disposals and it doesn't really factor in our Q4 cash flow. So that number is a little bit understated anyway.\nJeff Sprague: Very clear. Right. And also you got additional leverage to deploy if you want to. Great. Appreciate it. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe a lot of good color on the slides. Maybe one thing I wanted to touch on was just -- the overall organic growth backdrop. Your tone sounds pretty confident. I think bookings up mid-single-digit organic is sort of broadly what you expected. Just wondered sort of what your impression was of the broader environment in terms of customer activity, anything notable moving around? And tied to that, when we look at your segments, say in Q3, very, very wide spread of organic growth outcomes. One division up low double digit, one down high single-digits, when we're thinking about the 3% to 5% framework you have on Slide 10 for 2025, is the core assumption that the sort of variability across the five segments is much narrower and kind of all are contributing to growth.\nRichard Tobin: Yes, Julian, I think that's what we were trying to do with the Slide 8. I mean, I think -- the $300 million headwind was like a 4% or 5% growth headwind that we carried into this year that we were able to offset by the kind of the investments in our growth exposures. So what we're saying is, here we don't see any indication on the growth platforms for that growth rate, the law small numbers, of course, is that will continue at the same pace, I guess, in terms of growth going forward. And then we'll begin to lap the headwind that we have, basically, which is a long cycle part, is beverage can making, which is completely bottomed at this point and polymer processing, which we believe has bottomed at Q4 what we're going to see in heat exchanges next year. I'd like another quarter to figure it out and see what everybody is going to say about heat exchanges. But what we can from our channel checks, we would expect that by cutting production in Q4 will probably undercut into the market and just push demand into next year. So, if I look at the core portfolio, I don't see anything else that is in cycle down in 2025. We're just getting that behind us. And that was a 3% to -- 3% to -- 4% to 5% or 4% to 5% headwind this year. So that's why I think it's reasonable to expect I think when we modeled the year was 3% to 5% and the incremental margin, if you take out the restructuring benefit is basically where we've always been at 25 to 35.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe one quick follow-up on one of the segments. DII doesn't often get much attention, but superlative margin performance again in that business in Q3. You've seen that in the first half also. So, maybe sort of clarify. I know there's a mix commentary as a tailwind for DII. But is that something -- I don't know, structural changing in the mix in terms of kind how you've repositioned that business or it's simply just the consumables versus equipment dynamic and that may flip around next year?\nRichard Tobin: The consumables equipment will fluctuate quarter-by-quarter. But if you look at it over longer periods, it's not overly meaningful. So it does -- you hear comments quarter-to-quarter about it, but over a 12-month cycle, it always ends up in the same spot. Really, the margin performance here is that that the management team of particular business has done an excellent job on cost to serve. This is a global business. There -- it's synergy extraction from the cost to serve on a global basis. So, I mean that's the majority of -- if you go back and look over the last three years to four years, not generally been volume, it's been a business model change. So I don't think that these margins that we're posting now because I know what the pipeline is for 2025 and 2026. I think that this is a reasonable approximation where this business is capable of delivering.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Davis from Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hey, Scott.\nScott Davis: Hey, I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the M&A question. I think it was Jeff. It seems -- the deals we've seen in the last couple of years is that in the multiple ranges. The only deals that are kind of working are the ones where there's a fair amount of synergies. Is that -- is this something -- when you guys look at your existing portfolio, is there a wide enough net there to be able to buy things that bolt-on to make you kind of the, what I'll say, the best owner of that asset? Or do you think or multiples come down to the level where that's no longer the case?\nRichard Tobin: I think that if you go back and look at multiples paid here over the last four to five years, I think they've been reasonable. And at the time of the announcement on the kind of more material deals, there was always a good portion of the return that was based on synergy extraction. The smaller deals, there's really not a lot to do. But the bigger deals, we've built basically an engine on our existing -- if you think about when we went through from 2018 to about 2022, we had built this engine to extract synergies out of our own core portfolio, which drove a lot of margin expansion, while the benefit of building those engines, if you will, is when we do an M&A, we just do the same playbook just because we practice on ourselves for five years. So, they need to be a decent of enough size, but I think everything that we did of the bigger ones recently in Clean Energy had a good amount of synergy extraction. And if you go back and look at the transcript and you look on the clean energy side, I think that we posted a 20% margin this year. It's going to take us probably three quarters of 2025 to finish up on the footprint and everything else, but we fully expect to drive those businesses up to 2025 on synergy extraction alone.\nScott Davis: Okay. That's good color. Guys, maybe a dumb question. But when you're selling these thermal connectors, who's specking in the product? Is it the cloud guys? Or is it the cooling guys? And I still get -- want back in your good go on that design.\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Look, I'll answer it this way. We've been in this business for quite a while. So it's not a product that we're ramping up because of AI build-out. This product was actually built for supercomputing applications, which are the only ones that were using water cooling is relatively low volume in the past. So, it is set out and there are recommended specs, but you still need to sell to the user and/or builder. So, it's complicated, but we would -- we're the ones, I think, that we can claim to have the most product that's actually in use in the ecosystem today.\nScott Davis: Right. But the point is once it's spec-ed in, if it needs to be replaced to preventive maintenance or whatever, it's like-for-like, right?\nRichard Tobin: I think that would be the assumption, yes.\nScott Davis: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you guys. Good luck.\nRichard Tobin: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray, RBC.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: On the biopharma, the recovery underway in the single-use is what are the green shoots you're looking for? We saw results that would suggest from Danaher in particular, so is there anything broader going on in terms of how you think, because it's been the most extended destocking period for everyone, but just any color there would be helpful?\nRichard Tobin: Sure. Look, we led down because of the amount of inventory post-COVID that had put into the channel, and we're leading out, because these are consumable products, so these don't require new builds of new systems. They just need the systems that have been sold in previous periods to continue to operate. So, for a while, there was a little bit of de-linkage because we were going down early and from what our customers are saying, I think that we've been reading the reports from the market participants, and we're mostly in line now. I think we're all saying that basically the same thing in terms of the trajectory and the recovery. And I think that, that is reflected in our growth rates in terms of the consumables portion of it.\nDeane Dray: Good. And now you'll have doubled the amount of imaging questions that you typically get. Your primary competitor made a lot of noise about broadening our platform, what they call from source to shelf they're more vertically integrated than you guys, but is that a broader platform that you all would be interested in participating in. Do you have aspirations there, they paid up pretty sizably for a SaaS business?\nRichard Tobin: Deane, are we talking about the acquisition that they just made?\nDeane Dray: Yes. But then the--\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I mean, we've got a good sized track and trace platform within that business today. So I think it's nuanced in terms of where you are in the chain, we're more pharma oriented. And I haven't studied it, that looks like it's more food-oriented. So we've got a pretty big business right now that's actually been doing quite well over the last couple of years in that space. So we're already there.\nDeane Dray: Great. Thank you.\nRichard Tobin: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. And thanks for the 2025 kind of help out there. So it sounds, Rich, like you're pretty -- sort of like the base case would be organic range you laid out there. So, you'd encourage us to kind of use that range. But what I'm kind of curious of is when we look at the -- look at the 2024 performance, what impact did you have from the capital businesses, MAAG, Belvac and the SWEP European businesses? If we assume that those are bottoming out this year, maybe stabilize next year, what is the mechanical impact of those businesses?\nRichard Tobin: Nigel, if you go to Slide 8, on the presentation. We give you the absolute number. And it's -- I'm going to get it wrong, 3% to 5% -- 4% to 5% headwind that we're taking and that is on a rolling 12-month basis, correct? Q4 of last year through Q3 this year. It's cost us $300 million of headwinds and that's about 4% or 5% growth.\nNigel Coe: Okay. I completely missed that. So again, so if that then flattens out, your 3% to 5% seems -- I don't know, no improvement in the rest of the businesses. Is that the right way to react?\nRichard Tobin: Like you may have missed the beginning here. I mean we're not giving out 2025 guidance, we just thought that it was important because of all the noise with discontinued ops and everything else to kind of let you rebase your look on 2025. I didn't want to come out to this thing and say, well, here's discontinued ops, and we'll tell you in January, what that all means. So, it's a reasonable approximation, but give us another quarter to get an understanding of the macro and everything else. And I'm not saying that those are exactly going to be the numbers that we give out for 2025 guidance, but they look reasonable based on using the growth rates that we have on our secular growth exposures and then a lapping of the headwinds that we have seems reasonable. But rest assured, we'll update them in January.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's a good boiled plate response, Rich. And then just on -- just a quick clarification on the 4Q guide and then I'll pass it on. The 4Q -- sorry, the full year EPS the so I'm guessing there's about $0.10 of interest income coming through in the fourth quarter from the ESG divestment proceeds. So is that wrapped into the 102 -- or is that sort of within the $0.05 kind of bump up to the low end? Just any help there.\nRichard Tobin: I don't know whether it's $0.10. I'd have to go back and look at deconstruct it. There is an amount of interest income that's in the bump. That helps to offset what I mentioned earlier about we're taking heat exchanger volumes down, and we're making some production cuts there. So, yes, it's all in right now. And at the end of the day, we're driving towards the top of the range as usual.\nNigel Coe: Yes, okay. Thanks, Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Joe O'Dea, Wells Fargo.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nJoe O'Dea: Just wanted to touch on fueling and the comments around below-ground fueling inflecting positively. And any sort of context or perspective in terms of the cycle trends there and what you're seeing now in terms of how early on we are in seeing some growth?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I mean that's been a headwind for us for three years, I think, right, because it suffered with inflationary inputs and the lack of ability of labor and a variety of things that if you had gone and looked at the CapEx projections, for retail operators, they never hit their numbers just because of the inflation that was going through the system. So, with labor costs and labor just availability getting better, we've seen that begin to inflect positively, which is great because it's margin accretive to that particular business. So -- and we would expect that to cycle forward from here. On the demand side of it, it's been relatively muted, so you can't see it, but that is us. We are managing this business for margin, and I think we've made some tougher decisions about business that we would take, particularly in Europe and Asia. So that has muted the top line growth because we -- because in combination with the cryogenic components, if we get this right, we can get the entire segment up to 25% EBITDA margin at kind of an exit rate 25 or at least that's the goal.\nJoe O'Dea: I appreciate that. And then I just wanted to circle back on the restructuring. I think you talked about as we head into next year, $25 million of carryover, but also made some comments that there could be more. And so I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly in terms of are there additional sort of planning efforts underway and where we could see more of that happening across the business?\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I think that the $25 million is either completed or to be completed in fiscal year 2024. So that's the roll forward of what we get done this year. But we've got a lot to go. Like I mentioned previously, I think that the synergy target that we had put in the cryogenic acquisitions was about $20-ish, some of that requires footprint consolidation over time, which takes longer. So, back to my comment about driving that segment to 25%, we will be incurring costs clearly through the first two to three quarters of next year, which will require some more restructuring costs, which will pick up in kind of the further roll forward. So that number that you see in the chart, again, is incurred or to be completed in fiscal year 2024.\nJoe O'Dea: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: I'm going to ask an even dumber question than Scott. What is the actual revenue kind of guidance for this year, like the absolute kind of rough number you're guiding to for this year?\nRichard Tobin: I don't know. I think we gave you a range in the top line, right, of one to three. So--\nSteve Tusa: Right. But off of like -- is it like a $7.6 billion number, something like that comes out to?\nRichard Tobin: I don't know off the top of my head. Got me.\nSteve Tusa: I'm kind of -- I guess it's not a dumb question.\nRichard Tobin: I'm sure we can get it, and you can follow up with Jack to give it to you, but I don't know what the exact baseline number that it comes off.\nSteve Tusa: I think it's 77, by my math, just wanted to double check that. So how big are the headwinds...\nRichard Tobin: This is like questions about net interest income and your boss address that. Anyway, keep going.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, like total top line absolute sales\nRichard Tobin: Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Kind of important, I think. Don't you think?\nRichard Tobin: Well, I think that you'd be able to model that. But go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Like don't people ask you like cocktail parties, like how big the company is you run and you kind of throw out $8 billion and stuff like you should know that, right?\nRichard Tobin: I'm not a curtail party guy, but anyway, keep going.\nSteve Tusa: The headwind businesses, as we'll call them, how big are those this year? Are those about like $3 billion in total?\nRichard Tobin: No, no, no.\nSteve Tusa: $1 billion. Something like that?\nRichard Tobin: I'd have to do the math in my head. I mean, what are we talking on a 2024 full year basis?\nSteve Tusa: Yes. I mean just like what were -- like the $300 million was off of like what base, like--\nRichard Tobin: Yes like $1 billion -- I'm doing it in the back of my head, it's like $1 billion.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay, got it. And as far as like your outlook next year for pricing, is it a little more normal? Is it anywhere that you're seeing any kind of price pressure? Or is it kind of modestly positive or maybe even like a point or something like that for next year?\nRichard Tobin: Modestly -- modest -- more mix than anything else, but modestly positive on pricing. And to that end, we've been taking advantage of going long into 2025 because input pricing on commodity metals is pretty favorable. So we've been going actually going -- actually gone out of the 2025 to help that out.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just one last one for you. For the other businesses, kind of the mixed bag businesses outside of DII, of course, any of those in there that are kind of like on watch for like declines next year? And any that worry you out of the other -- not the secular growth, not DII and not the headwind businesses like the other business?\nRichard Tobin: Try to cover in the commentary. We knew about Belvac. We knew about MAAG. We kind of knew but got it wrong on heat exchangers. There's not another business in the portfolio with that kind of quantum headwind as we look into 2025. So the only kind of worry that we would have would be about the macro, and then we'll see.\nSteve Tusa: Right. Okay. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks a lot.\nRichard Tobin: Great.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Hi, good morning, guys.\nRichard Tobin: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Tough act to follow there. The -- so I'm going to ask Steve's question may be slightly more positively or class have full. If I -- we're getting to, hopefully, election certainty sometime in the next month or so. Project financing arguably hopefully getting better because of interest rates. You've had one of your competitors call out the fact that, that's really impacted their carwash business as you kind of think through like that macro element, which is both election and interest rates, like where could you potentially see a benefit to your business? And how do you see that kind of playing out in 2025? And know that you don't have a crystal ball, so your best guess at this point.\nRichard Tobin: Yes, I mean I think we would have hoped that interest rates would have had a bigger impact in the second half of 2024 on volume. But I think because of election uncertainty and a variety of other things, you can feel a little bit of caution out there. It's not bad, but it's not the amount -- if we take a look at the amount of quoting that we do for project-based business versus the time that it takes for those quotes to turn into actual orders, you can -- and this notion of things being pushed that you'll hear a lot about, that's not a fail, right? So, -- to the extent that cost of capital stays down and that we get some kind of certainty going into 2025, I would expect -- if we take a look at some of our businesses that you could call kind of like more project related that we would expect that to inflect positively.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, fair enough. And then we talked a little bit about the recovery in biopharma, which is awesome to see. The next kind of logical question is like when can we get the margins back up to that 30-plus range. And I know that you're feeling good about the recovery of that business into 2025, and so just kind of any thoughts around getting back to 30% next year?\nRichard Tobin: Well, it was 29% in the quarter. And that's taking into account still -- still taking into account that MAAG is probably is bottoming now. And by the way, to MAAG's credit despite the top line headwinds, their ability to preserve margins during that period was excellent. So, to me, it's more of what is going to be the growth rate in biopharma and thermal and single-use pumps, everything that we've got in that particular segment to the extent that it stays on the track that it is, it's all incremental margin positive to the 29% we just posted.\nJoe Ritchie: Good to hear. Great. Thanks guys.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Rich, with the understanding that you aren't giving out 2025 guidance, as you just said, you did say that do 40% incrementals with some restructuring tailwind and mix benefits. And as you know, you've talked about 25% to 35% long-term incremental. So, should we get more excited at this point that with accelerated portfolio transformation, Dover is really making that transition to a higher incremental margin capable company? Or is that a bit premature?\nRichard Tobin: No, I don't think it's premature at all at the end of the day. I mean, we love ESG, but the fact of the matter is, it was a high-growth business that had decremental margins to the greater portfolio. And that's -- other than end market cyclicality and blah, blah, blah part of the reason that we took the action that we took. So -- and I don't want to keep repeating myself, but if you go back to Slide 8, Slide 8 is what we talked about back at the last Investor Day, this is where we're investing in organically and inorganically. And hopefully, we should be doing that in businesses that have higher growth rates and higher margin profiles to them. I mean you saw it -- you saw it yourself an action when you went down to DFR and Conyers, I mean that CO2 systems business is a high-growth, high incremental margin to the segment business. So it's -- we've got all the irons in the fire, whether it's portfolio construction or organic investment or inorganic investment, it's all part and parcel to driving the consolidated segment margin to 2025, right? And we're going to get there by hook or by crook.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Love it. Okay. And then just another question you love around bookings. Just one clarification, like was DCST really the heat exchanger stuff, the big difference in what you thought versus that book-to-bill of one. I know you mentioned macro is maybe still holding some projects back. As you look at Q4, do you see book-to-bill getting closer to one if CST does begin to show some life on the heat exchanger side?\nRichard Tobin: It depends on what the order intake is going to be in CO2 systems because we're basically taking bookings assumptions down for heat pumps. So what we had originally forecast for heat pumps is worse going into Q4 which is accommodated into our forecast. Whether we can -- we know -- maybe I should be that definitive. We expect that we will inflect materially higher in bookings on CO2 systems. It's just a question of whether we can get them from forecasting to orders in Q4 or not.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Got it. But it's coming in the next couple of quarters, just a question of when.\nRichard Tobin: Yes.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Helpful. Thanks, Rich.\nRichard Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird.\nMike Halloran: Good morning, everyone.\nRichard Tobin: Good morning.\nMike Halloran: So, of couple quick -- couple of quick ones. Just on the comment of managing capacity utilization, I don't think this is of the scale that you would have talked about fourth quarter last year. Is this just tied to the heat exchanger piece? Or is there anything broader? and any comments on inventory levels in the channel?\nRichard Tobin: Yes. Overall, we'd like to maximize cash flow in Q4. And then depending on how we are in terms of backlog and the delivery assumptions that backlog, if we believe can push production performance in January out of Q4, it's prudent to do so at the end of the day, right, because it flexes up cash flow and it preserves fixed cost absorption into next year. So, we'll do that in select businesses in Q4, and that's why we're kind of happy about the results in Q3 because it buys us the room to do that because we don't want to be like trying to protect margin in Q4 by building inventory, right? So it's not nearly what it was back in the beginning of the destocking days where we consciously made a decision to do that across the wider portfolio. This is a more selective comment.\nMike Halloran: Makes sense. And not beating a dead horse here. I just want to make sure I understand. The 25% margin comments for DCF, that was applicable to the whole segment, not just the gas piece or something more insular exiting 2025?\nRichard Tobin: The whole segment.\nMike Halloran: Quite a gem. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nRichard Tobin: Great. Thanks. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6, just a reminder that our presentation today is on a continuing operations basis excluding our divested Environmental Solutions Group business from the historical results. Let's go to the charts. The top bridge shows our revenue growth. The impact of acquired businesses this year more than offset the disposition of DESTACO which closed on March 31 by $21 million, while FX was basically flat. From a geographic perspective, the US, our largest market, was up 8% in the quarter on healthy broad-based demand. Europe and Asia were down 5% and 10%, respectively. China, which represents about half our revenue base in Asia was down 17% organically in the quarter, primarily due to shipment timing within polymer processing. On the bottom chart, bookings were up $90 million organically year-over-year on solid broad-based demand across most end markets. Below-the-line items were slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis in the quarter on higher corporate costs, mostly related to acquisition deal costs. Our cash flow statement is on Slide 7. Adjusting for taxes paid on the gain of DESTACO, which are non-operational in nature, our free cash flow was 17% of revenue in the quarter, up $48 million year-over-year. Year-to-date cash flow on this chart is 11% of revenue. The fourth quarter is historically our highest cash flow quarter as we expect more favorable working capital balances over the rest of the year. We are on track to deliver our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of 13% to 15% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. With that, let me turn it back to Rich. Hey, Jeff. Hi, Andy."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the performance highlights on Page 3. Overall, the quarter was modestly better than our internal forecast, which I'll cover in the upcoming segment results slides. Top line performance was broad-based across the portfolio. We are especially pleased that the rotation from our longer cycle businesses to our growth platforms has continued to drive positive margin mix for the total portfolio. We expect that to be an underlying theme as we head into 2025. Segment margin performance for the quarter was solid at 22.6% and represents an all-time high for Dover's consolidated portfolio. Bookings were up 5% organically in the quarter with particular strength clean energy, thermal connectors, CO2 systems and biopharma components, further bolstering our positive mix outlook. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up 6% to $2.27. During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Environmental Solutions Group business, reducing our exposure to the capital goods sector. As you can see from the bottom right of the slide, the reconciliation of this impact to our full year adjusted EPS guidance from continuing operations. As a result of this transaction, we will exit 2024 with record capital deployment, firepower, providing us with a variety of value-creation opportunities going forward. Our outlook remains constructive for the balance of the year. Our third quarter performance has given us room to manage demand seasonality to drive cash flow optimization through year-end by thoughtfully managing capacity utilization. Our setup for 2025 is compelling with positive portfolio rotation into higher margin businesses as we lap easy and long cycle comps through the year. This is further augmented by our exceptional balance sheet, optionality to pursue value-creating capital deployment strategies. Let's skip to Slide 5 on segment performance. Engineered Products posted strong top line performance on volume growth in vehicle services and industrial winches. Aerospace and defense was lower in the period due to shipment timing and a difficult comparable quarter. Margin was down modestly, because of margin mix on reduced aerospace and defense volumes. Clean Energy & Fueling was down 1% organic as positive performance in clean energy components and North American retail fueling was offset by lower volumes in vehicle wash and retail fueling equipment in Europe and Asia. Bookings were positive in the quarter, as below-ground retail fueling volumes are inflecting positively along with cryogenic components. Margin was flat as favorable product mix was offset by near-term integration costs of our most recent acquisitions. We expect this dynamic to have a material positive margin swing, as we complete our integration activities through 2025. Imaging & Identification posted an excellent quarter on solid marketing and coating performance in the U.S. and Europe. New printer shipments inflected positively during the quarter, which is a good signal for customer capital spending. Margin performance was robust as management actions on cost to serve and footprint optimization continued to drive incremental margins. Pumps & Process Solutions was up 2% organically on robust shipments in thermal connectors precision components biopharma connectors and pumps, biopharma revenue is up mid-teens, year-to-date and over 30% versus the comparable quarter of the prior year. As forecasted, polymer processing equipment was down in the period. All in, Pumps & Process Solutions segment bookings were up 15% organically in the quarter as biopharma and growth platform cycles inflected positively. Segment revenue mix drove 200 basis points of margin improvement on excellent performance, production performance on volume growth in Biopharma and thermal margin mix from FW -- the FW Murphy acquisition and tight cost controls in -- in the Polymers business. Revenue was down in the quarter in Climate & Sustainability Technologies as solid demand in food retail systems was offset by tough comps, in beverage can making equipment and weak demand in the broader HVAC complex, particularly in European residential heat pumps, on our brazed plate heat exchanger business. We had hoped to see positive bookings inflection in heat exchangers in the quarter, but that was not the case. So we have taken down our forecast in the back half of the year in that business to preserve production performance for 2025. The frustrating results as we were able to hold segment margins flat despite the lower volumes due to excellent performance in our retail refrigeration business that was augmented by exceptionally good shipment rates in CO2 systems. Despite the short-term challenges, we like the setup going into 2025 based on increasing CO2 demand, where we expect bookings to inflect materially higher together with market recovery and heat exchanges, both of which are margin accretive. I'll pass it to Brad here. Thanks, Brad. I'm on Slide 8. It was a busy quarter with the portfolio moves, discontinued ops and some counter cyclicality within the portfolio. As a result of that, we thought it prudent to lay the groundwork for 2025 earlier to provide some hopefully helpful views. Let's start with the portfolio. We articulated throughout the year that underlying demand across many of our end marks -- end markets is solid, and that remains the case as we look forward into 2025. With a diverse portfolio such as ours, we enter each planning cycle, constructing a view of the overall macro, the individual business cycles and our competitive position. In 2024, we had a familiar challenge much like we did in the post-COVID period navigating the biopharma demand cycle. In 2024, we managed a down cycle on the portion of our high long-cycle portfolio as well as the regulatory and stocking idiosyncrasies, cheeses and heat exchangers as shown on the right side of the page. As you can see on the slide, we managed to offset significant cycle headwind with mixing up our consolidated margin on broader short-cycle improvement augmented by our growth platforms, which we invested in both organically and inorganically. As we complete 2024 and begin forming our view for 2025, we do not receive the same counter cyclicality in the portfolio. Bookings and customer forecasts indicate that our growth platforms are in a multi-period demand cycle. We are particularly pleased with the growth rate and biopharma components, thermal connectors, precision components and CO2 systems, all with margin accretion attributes to the portfolio. We expect heat exchanges to return to growth in 2025 on the recovery heat pumps and large-format demand district heating and data center applications for which we are expanding production capacity today. Let's move to Slide 9. Organic investment, inorganic growth and shareholder-friendly capital return remain front and center to our strategy, and we have done all three so far in 2024. We have been more active on portfolio pruning this year at attractive valuations as we methodically reshaped the portfolio to higher secular growth and less cyclical end market exposures. As mentioned earlier, we will exit 2024 with significant optionality for capital deployment and/or capital return, which is reflected on the balance sheet capacity bar on the right. Let's finish up with Slide 10. I've already covered the adjusted EPS guidance to accommodate the discontinued operations earlier in the deck, which is summarized on the left. At the time of the ESG announcement, we are often asked about the assumptions needed to offset the lost earnings from divestitures in 2025. We prepared the bridge on the slide to provide some direction on the moving pieces on a pro forma basis. Let's not get too excited. We will, as always, provide formal 2025 guidance after the close of the year, but I thought it would -- I thought, but I hope that you find it to be a reasonable pro forma view that provides clarity on the moving parts. Left to right, we start with predisposal EPS from our previous guide. We treat retrospectively the disposals on a full year basis. We treat the cash balance prospectively as it ever held for the full year in the short-term in highly liquid positions where it is presently, which includes the retirement of commercial paper costs in 2024 and we roll forward the 2024 acquisitions earnings benefit. We get to a rebased 2025 EPS of $8.60 to $8.75 on a base model that assumes zero organic growth in 2025. If we model a 3% to 5% organic growth at a 40% conversion rate next year, which includes $25 million in restructuring roll forward that is already completed or underway this year. We get an additional $0.55 to $0.90 of EPS. As I mentioned earlier, we are accelerating our synergy capture from recent acquisitions, including footprint consolidation, so what I would expect the restructuring contribution to be higher in 2025. Considering what was covered in the growth platform's growth trajectory, margin mix and long cycle comparable performance that we discussed on Slide 8, the top line and incremental margin assumptions seem reasonable. Now, I certainly doubt that we'll sit on that amount of liquidity unless there is a drastic negative change in the macro. And then in that case, it is nice to have an insurance policy. Clearly, this model can be flexed for share repurchases and M&A, but the model timing is problematic. So this is a simple value view. Our preference is to be active on the M&A front. And at present, that environment is getting better. We have an interesting opportunity pipeline, but rest assured, we will proceed with the capital discipline that we have demonstrated in the past. With that, let's go to Q&A. And I won't say any of opacities or whatever. Okay. Let's go. Good morning, Jeff. Yes. I mean I think there was a bookings comment more than anything else. If you recall back last quarter, we had said that we would hope to have seen bookings increase in brazed plate heat exchanges for European heat pumps. That was not the case. So we have taken down our full year estimates in that particular product line. So that's negative to bookings now. We're going to take down production just to let whatever the remaining clearing event needs to take place between now and the end of the year. So we'll cut production in Q4 also in terms of the estimates. At that point, I think it's fair to say that bookings based on what we see in our forecast for 2025 demand and heat pumps should inflect positively going forward there, and in CO2 systems based on feedback that we're getting from the market in terms of spend, we would expect a material amount of bookings inflection there, whether we get it all in Q4, whether it splits between Q4 and Q1, we'll see. But based on our market read there, we think that we're going to be materially up on CO2 systems in 2025. Yes. I mean, and that's -- I tried to cover that in the commentary, Jeff. Look, at the end of the day, someone described that the in the bag, it would be just to sit on the liquidity and that liquidity, you can just basically say that deposit rates even with factoring in rate cuts would drive that kind of result. In my comments, I said, I don't foresee that actually happening. Now whether it's M&A or share repurchases, that math gets funky, right? Because you got to start, but we've done the models here and said, if it's margin accretive, and we paid 15 times, what does that look what does that look like? And if you close it into Q1, what does that look like? Or if we did a share repurchase of $1 billion, like? You can do those scenarios. But we just thought that optically to give you a view of it's not only the -- not 2021 anymore, where holding on to liquidity was a zero-sum game because your cost of carry was neutral, if not negative. Now, it's meaningful. And if you go back and look at our interest cost on commercial paper in 2024 and you add that back again, the gap that we have in the lost earnings is really what we're trying to show here is significantly reduced because of that carry. So, I hope and I would expect that the interest income line is going to be overstated because I would expect us to deploy M&A capital. But just as a note, that cash balance is just the proceeds and the after-tax proceeds of the disposals and it doesn't really factor in our Q4 cash flow. So that number is a little bit understated anyway. Yes. Thanks. Yes, Julian, I think that's what we were trying to do with the Slide 8. I mean, I think -- the $300 million headwind was like a 4% or 5% growth headwind that we carried into this year that we were able to offset by the kind of the investments in our growth exposures. So what we're saying is, here we don't see any indication on the growth platforms for that growth rate, the law small numbers, of course, is that will continue at the same pace, I guess, in terms of growth going forward. And then we'll begin to lap the headwind that we have, basically, which is a long cycle part, is beverage can making, which is completely bottomed at this point and polymer processing, which we believe has bottomed at Q4 what we're going to see in heat exchanges next year. I'd like another quarter to figure it out and see what everybody is going to say about heat exchanges. But what we can from our channel checks, we would expect that by cutting production in Q4 will probably undercut into the market and just push demand into next year. So, if I look at the core portfolio, I don't see anything else that is in cycle down in 2025. We're just getting that behind us. And that was a 3% to -- 3% to -- 4% to 5% or 4% to 5% headwind this year. So that's why I think it's reasonable to expect I think when we modeled the year was 3% to 5% and the incremental margin, if you take out the restructuring benefit is basically where we've always been at 25 to 35. The consumables equipment will fluctuate quarter-by-quarter. But if you look at it over longer periods, it's not overly meaningful. So it does -- you hear comments quarter-to-quarter about it, but over a 12-month cycle, it always ends up in the same spot. Really, the margin performance here is that that the management team of particular business has done an excellent job on cost to serve. This is a global business. There -- it's synergy extraction from the cost to serve on a global basis. So, I mean that's the majority of -- if you go back and look over the last three years to four years, not generally been volume, it's been a business model change. So I don't think that these margins that we're posting now because I know what the pipeline is for 2025 and 2026. I think that this is a reasonable approximation where this business is capable of delivering. You're welcome. Hey, Scott. I think that if you go back and look at multiples paid here over the last four to five years, I think they've been reasonable. And at the time of the announcement on the kind of more material deals, there was always a good portion of the return that was based on synergy extraction. The smaller deals, there's really not a lot to do. But the bigger deals, we've built basically an engine on our existing -- if you think about when we went through from 2018 to about 2022, we had built this engine to extract synergies out of our own core portfolio, which drove a lot of margin expansion, while the benefit of building those engines, if you will, is when we do an M&A, we just do the same playbook just because we practice on ourselves for five years. So, they need to be a decent of enough size, but I think everything that we did of the bigger ones recently in Clean Energy had a good amount of synergy extraction. And if you go back and look at the transcript and you look on the clean energy side, I think that we posted a 20% margin this year. It's going to take us probably three quarters of 2025 to finish up on the footprint and everything else, but we fully expect to drive those businesses up to 2025 on synergy extraction alone. Yes. Look, I'll answer it this way. We've been in this business for quite a while. So it's not a product that we're ramping up because of AI build-out. This product was actually built for supercomputing applications, which are the only ones that were using water cooling is relatively low volume in the past. So, it is set out and there are recommended specs, but you still need to sell to the user and/or builder. So, it's complicated, but we would -- we're the ones, I think, that we can claim to have the most product that's actually in use in the ecosystem today. I think that would be the assumption, yes. Thank you. Good morning. Sure. Look, we led down because of the amount of inventory post-COVID that had put into the channel, and we're leading out, because these are consumable products, so these don't require new builds of new systems. They just need the systems that have been sold in previous periods to continue to operate. So, for a while, there was a little bit of de-linkage because we were going down early and from what our customers are saying, I think that we've been reading the reports from the market participants, and we're mostly in line now. I think we're all saying that basically the same thing in terms of the trajectory and the recovery. And I think that, that is reflected in our growth rates in terms of the consumables portion of it. Deane, are we talking about the acquisition that they just made? Yes, I mean, we've got a good sized track and trace platform within that business today. So I think it's nuanced in terms of where you are in the chain, we're more pharma oriented. And I haven't studied it, that looks like it's more food-oriented. So we've got a pretty big business right now that's actually been doing quite well over the last couple of years in that space. So we're already there. You're welcome. Nigel, if you go to Slide 8, on the presentation. We give you the absolute number. And it's -- I'm going to get it wrong, 3% to 5% -- 4% to 5% headwind that we're taking and that is on a rolling 12-month basis, correct? Q4 of last year through Q3 this year. It's cost us $300 million of headwinds and that's about 4% or 5% growth. Like you may have missed the beginning here. I mean we're not giving out 2025 guidance, we just thought that it was important because of all the noise with discontinued ops and everything else to kind of let you rebase your look on 2025. I didn't want to come out to this thing and say, well, here's discontinued ops, and we'll tell you in January, what that all means. So, it's a reasonable approximation, but give us another quarter to get an understanding of the macro and everything else. And I'm not saying that those are exactly going to be the numbers that we give out for 2025 guidance, but they look reasonable based on using the growth rates that we have on our secular growth exposures and then a lapping of the headwinds that we have seems reasonable. But rest assured, we'll update them in January. I don't know whether it's $0.10. I'd have to go back and look at deconstruct it. There is an amount of interest income that's in the bump. That helps to offset what I mentioned earlier about we're taking heat exchanger volumes down, and we're making some production cuts there. So, yes, it's all in right now. And at the end of the day, we're driving towards the top of the range as usual. Thanks. Good morning. Yes, I mean that's been a headwind for us for three years, I think, right, because it suffered with inflationary inputs and the lack of ability of labor and a variety of things that if you had gone and looked at the CapEx projections, for retail operators, they never hit their numbers just because of the inflation that was going through the system. So, with labor costs and labor just availability getting better, we've seen that begin to inflect positively, which is great because it's margin accretive to that particular business. So -- and we would expect that to cycle forward from here. On the demand side of it, it's been relatively muted, so you can't see it, but that is us. We are managing this business for margin, and I think we've made some tougher decisions about business that we would take, particularly in Europe and Asia. So that has muted the top line growth because we -- because in combination with the cryogenic components, if we get this right, we can get the entire segment up to 25% EBITDA margin at kind of an exit rate 25 or at least that's the goal. Yes, I think that the $25 million is either completed or to be completed in fiscal year 2024. So that's the roll forward of what we get done this year. But we've got a lot to go. Like I mentioned previously, I think that the synergy target that we had put in the cryogenic acquisitions was about $20-ish, some of that requires footprint consolidation over time, which takes longer. So, back to my comment about driving that segment to 25%, we will be incurring costs clearly through the first two to three quarters of next year, which will require some more restructuring costs, which will pick up in kind of the further roll forward. So that number that you see in the chart, again, is incurred or to be completed in fiscal year 2024. Hi, Steve. I don't know. I think we gave you a range in the top line, right, of one to three. So-- I don't know off the top of my head. Got me. I'm sure we can get it, and you can follow up with Jack to give it to you, but I don't know what the exact baseline number that it comes off. This is like questions about net interest income and your boss address that. Anyway, keep going. Yes. Well, I think that you'd be able to model that. But go ahead. I'm not a curtail party guy, but anyway, keep going. No, no, no. I'd have to do the math in my head. I mean, what are we talking on a 2024 full year basis? Yes like $1 billion -- I'm doing it in the back of my head, it's like $1 billion. Modestly -- modest -- more mix than anything else, but modestly positive on pricing. And to that end, we've been taking advantage of going long into 2025 because input pricing on commodity metals is pretty favorable. So we've been going actually going -- actually gone out of the 2025 to help that out. Try to cover in the commentary. We knew about Belvac. We knew about MAAG. We kind of knew but got it wrong on heat exchangers. There's not another business in the portfolio with that kind of quantum headwind as we look into 2025. So the only kind of worry that we would have would be about the macro, and then we'll see. Great. Hi, Joe. Yes, I mean I think we would have hoped that interest rates would have had a bigger impact in the second half of 2024 on volume. But I think because of election uncertainty and a variety of other things, you can feel a little bit of caution out there. It's not bad, but it's not the amount -- if we take a look at the amount of quoting that we do for project-based business versus the time that it takes for those quotes to turn into actual orders, you can -- and this notion of things being pushed that you'll hear a lot about, that's not a fail, right? So, -- to the extent that cost of capital stays down and that we get some kind of certainty going into 2025, I would expect -- if we take a look at some of our businesses that you could call kind of like more project related that we would expect that to inflect positively. Well, it was 29% in the quarter. And that's taking into account still -- still taking into account that MAAG is probably is bottoming now. And by the way, to MAAG's credit despite the top line headwinds, their ability to preserve margins during that period was excellent. So, to me, it's more of what is going to be the growth rate in biopharma and thermal and single-use pumps, everything that we've got in that particular segment to the extent that it stays on the track that it is, it's all incremental margin positive to the 29% we just posted. Thanks. Good morning. No, I don't think it's premature at all at the end of the day. I mean, we love ESG, but the fact of the matter is, it was a high-growth business that had decremental margins to the greater portfolio. And that's -- other than end market cyclicality and blah, blah, blah part of the reason that we took the action that we took. So -- and I don't want to keep repeating myself, but if you go back to Slide 8, Slide 8 is what we talked about back at the last Investor Day, this is where we're investing in organically and inorganically. And hopefully, we should be doing that in businesses that have higher growth rates and higher margin profiles to them. I mean you saw it -- you saw it yourself an action when you went down to DFR and Conyers, I mean that CO2 systems business is a high-growth, high incremental margin to the segment business. So it's -- we've got all the irons in the fire, whether it's portfolio construction or organic investment or inorganic investment, it's all part and parcel to driving the consolidated segment margin to 2025, right? And we're going to get there by hook or by crook. It depends on what the order intake is going to be in CO2 systems because we're basically taking bookings assumptions down for heat pumps. So what we had originally forecast for heat pumps is worse going into Q4 which is accommodated into our forecast. Whether we can -- we know -- maybe I should be that definitive. We expect that we will inflect materially higher in bookings on CO2 systems. It's just a question of whether we can get them from forecasting to orders in Q4 or not. Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Yes. Overall, we'd like to maximize cash flow in Q4. And then depending on how we are in terms of backlog and the delivery assumptions that backlog, if we believe can push production performance in January out of Q4, it's prudent to do so at the end of the day, right, because it flexes up cash flow and it preserves fixed cost absorption into next year. So, we'll do that in select businesses in Q4, and that's why we're kind of happy about the results in Q3 because it buys us the room to do that because we don't want to be like trying to protect margin in Q4 by building inventory, right? So it's not nearly what it was back in the beginning of the destocking days where we consciously made a decision to do that across the wider portfolio. This is a more selective comment. The whole segment. Great. Thanks. Thank you."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director, Investor Relations. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens, please go ahead, sir.\nJack Dickens: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through August 15th, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks, Jack. I'm on Slide 3. Second quarter results were solid, driven by excellent production and shipment performance against our order book. Strong revenue performance was broad-based across our end market and geographic exposures with four out of five segments posting top line growth. Organic revenue was up 5% for the quarter. Bookings were up 16% organically year-over-year, continuing their upward trajectory over the last several quarters and bolstering our confidence in our second half outlook. Margin performance was excellent, up 200 basis points over the prior year to 22.1%, driven by volume leverage, organic and inorganic mix, proactive cost management and rigorous productivity actions. Our strong operational results were complemented by ongoing portfolio evolution actions. Over the last week, we have completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions, enhancing our clean energy components platform, adding applications in highly attractive end markets, expanding our global reach and strategically expanding our manufacturing base into new regions. We also recently announced the sale of our Environmental Services Group business unit for $2 billion in cash. This transaction, together with the sale of De-Sta-Co in March of this year, reflects our intention to reduce our exposure to capital goods, we have monetized these businesses where we have materially improved operating performance at attractive exit multiples while methodically migrating our portfolio toward higher organic growth and margin opportunities. We are approaching the second half of the year constructively. The underlying end market demand is healthy and is supported by our sustained order rates. We are, therefore, raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $9.05 to $9.20. I'll skip to Slide 4. Engineered Products had another robust quarter, driven particularly strong volume growth and conversion of waste handling and aerospace and defense. Volumes of vehicle aftermarket grew in recovering European market conditions and improved production performance. We expect volumes to remain strong for the segment through 2024. Margin performance was solid in the quarter on strong volume conversion, favorable mix and productivity. Clean energy and fueling was up 2% organically in the quarter on solid volumes in clean energy components where we're starting to see robust quoting activity and order rate momentum from component parts tied to large projects in hydrogen and cryogenic applications. Volumes were also solid in software systems and above-ground retail fueling continued its positive recovery, particularly in the U.S. Margins were flat in the quarter as proactive cost curtailment offset volumes and mix. Imaging and ID posted an excellent quarter on growth in serialization software and strong shipments from marking and coding consumables and aftermarket parts. Printer shipments were still subdued, improved sequentially and should inflect positively in the second half. Margin performance was exemplary on SG&A leverage and a higher mix of consumables and aftermarket shipments. Pumps and Process Solutions was down organically as expected, principally due to lower shipments in our long-cycle polymer processing business partially offsetting these headwinds were significant growth in shipments and new bookings for thermal connectors tied to AI chip liquid cooling applications and data centers as well as a solid quarter in precision components. Both orders and shipments of single-use biopharma components grew sequentially and year-over-year continuing to post-COVID recovery. Margins in the segment were up on mix and operational execution. Top line performance and Climate & Sustainability Technologies outperformed our internal estimates due to an exceptional quarter in food retail which nearly offset the capital investment slowdown in beverage can making an impact of destocking headwinds in the broader HVAC complex, most notably in European residential heat pumps, on our European brazed plate heat exchanger business. We expect these headwinds to persist in the second half, with heat pump-related shipments troughing in the third quarter. Margin performance was exceptional driven particularly by food retail, which posted all-time record margin in the quarter on strong volume conversion and a greater mix of CO2 systems shipments. I'll pass it to Brad here.\nBrad Cerepak: Okay. I'm on Slide 6. The top bridge shows our organic revenue growth of 5% and the De-Sta-Co sale, which was closed on March 31, more than offset acquisition-related revenue of \u2013 by $9 million, while FX was a headwind of approximately $13 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was up 11% in the quarter on solid broad-based activity with particular strength in waste handling and food retail. Europe and all of Asia was down 4% and 9%, respectively. China, which represents half our revenue base in Asia was down 8% organically in the quarter, primarily due to shipment timing within polymer processing. On the bottom of the chart, bookings were up year-over-year. Of note, orders were also marginally up sequentially on an organic basis quarter-to-quarter. Below-the-line items negatively impacted our earnings in the quarter, driven by a higher tax rate as well as higher corporate costs net of interest due in part to elevated deal expenses. Now on our cash flow statement, Slide 7. Adjusting for taxes paid on the gain De-Sta-Co, which are non-operational in nature, our free cash flow came in at 10% of revenue in the quarter, up $64 million year-over-year. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow is essentially flat versus the prior period despite investments in working capital due to shipment timing driving higher receivable balances as well as investments in inventory due to strong bookings rates. We expect to materially liquidate our working capital balances over the second half of the year and are on track to deliver our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of 13% to 15% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks Brad. I am on Slide 8. Here, we provide some visibility into the contribution of the portfolio of both the ESG divestiture and the recently closed acquisitions in clean energy components providers, Marshall Excelsior and Demaco. These transactions continue our purposeful portfolio migration away from capital goods towards higher gross margin, less cyclical and higher growth component businesses, that serve secular, advantaged end markets. We have been methodical and disciplined in our approach to enhancing the portfolio through acquisitions and patient in our strategic divestitures. We are pleased with the valuations of our two recent divestitures within Engineered Products, ESG announced on Monday and De-Sta-Co, which closed in March that both achieved above 13 times trailing EBITDA multiples, significant premiums for capital goods assets. The transaction details are on the page. Due to the timing of the ESG signing and uncertainty of the closing date, we have left ESG in our full year guidance for now. We expect to move ESG discontinued ops in Q3 earnings report, and we'll recast our historical financials and guidance at that time. The ESG earnings profile is shown on the page. And importantly, we are not including any benefit of the transaction proceeds toward value-added capital deployment. We believe we are entering a 12- to 18-month period that represents a unique buying opportunity for attractive assets including many private equity-owned businesses that are overdue for exits in our highest priority areas of inorganic expansion. Our current balance sheet strength and cash flow forecast reinforced by the proceeds of the ESG divestiture positioned us well to remain on the front foot in pursuit of attractive capital deployment opportunities. Let's go to Slide 9. I wanted to provide a little more color on our collection of businesses that provide critical flow control and safety components for industrial gas, cryogenics, natural gas and clean energy applications. These businesses span across both our pumps and process solutions and clean energy and fueling segments, so there is significant commonality in industrial tailwinds and business models. These businesses provide highly engineered components that serve demanding applications in the broader clean energy and industrial gas complexes and there are growing requirements for sustainability, emissions reduction and safety that create favorable product loyalty dynamics and innovation opportunities for us. Our positions in these attractive markets are supported by strong and recognized technological and application expertise and intellectual property with large installed bases that drive reoccurring replacement demand as well as exposure to high growth uses like hydrogen and LNG. We have been active acquirers in the space investing roughly $2 billion over the last several years. We believe these investments should generate mid to high-digit growth at margins accretive to our consolidated portfolio over the long run. This remains a high priority area investment for us moving forward. In light of our recent divestitures, with the scale of this critical component platform now reaching $1 billion of revenue, we intend to readdress our current segment structure in the near future to add focus and disclosures around our growth platforms. Slide 10 provides a little bit more color on Marshall Excelsior, the larger of the two energy businesses that we've acquired in the last week. MEC\u2019s acquisition broadens our portfolio in cryogenic valves and other components and expands our participation in several applications, including the expansion into remote monitoring and digital controls in cryogenic transport and severe duty valves providing an excellent opportunity for cross-selling. Integrating MEC into our existing clean energy platforms and centralized support functions should provide significant cost savings. We expect to capture about $12 million in run rate synergies driving MEC to high 20s margin and high single-digit ROIC by year three. Taking a step back, shows the broad scope of our offering within clean energy applications. We're supplying a variety of safety-critical components like valves, regulators, nozzles, loading arms, dispensing and gas handling equipment for a variety of applications across the high, the whole cryogenic gas value chain from production to consumption. We serve both gas and liquefied gas applications with multiple molecules handled, including LNG, hydrogen propane, oxygen and nitrogen, among others, and we're benefiting from strong investment momentum by industrial gas majors and global government infrastructure spending. While a smaller deal for us, Demaco was also closed last week, providing us a very important European base of manufacturing to enhance our growth and global scale. Finally, on Slide 12 shows the long-term performance of the portfolio. We continued to deliver earnings growth through a combination of top line organic growth, margin improvement through operational execution and returns on productive capital deployment strategies to methodically improve our portfolio over time. Our strong balance sheet position will be further enhanced by the proceeds of the ESG divestiture in the second half of the year. We expect to end the year with approximately $3 billion in capital deployment firepower from cash and reasonable leverage levels. We have a number of levers available to deliver the second half of the flexible business model can quickly respond to changes in our dynamic markets. I'd like to end by thanking ESG President, Pat Carroll and his entire management team for the value they created for Dover shareholders under their tenure. With that, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Can you hear me okay?\nRichard J. Tobin: Hi, good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: We can here you, Andy. Go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey Rich, maybe you could talk about bookings cadence during the quarter and how you\u2019re thinking about bookings growth going forward? Do you still see book-to-bill over 1 times for the rest of the year? And then as I\u2019m sure you know, short-cycle market seem all over the place at best. So what are you seeing macro-wise? And would you say that Dover\u2019s outperformance is really a result of Dover\u2019s unique exposures versus a lot of macro improvement?\nRichard J. Tobin: Yes, I would expect it to be over one. As you know, I think that our comps are either in the second half of the year from an order basis. It\u2019s been a little bit lumpy, I have to say, intra-quarter. So we\u2019ll see how it goes, but our expectation is to be over one for the balance of the year. And I think that\u2019s reflected if you take a look at our full year forecast in terms of revenue growth and everything else. The outperformance \u2013 look, I mean, I think at the end of the day, we led in, we led it out, and we\u2019re probably leading in again. So as we\u2019ve discussed previously, I think that our inventory positions are well placed and some of the markets that we have exposure to that have suffered over the previous 24 months or making a turn. We add on top of that some of the growth platforms like we have like thermal connectors and CO2 systems, which are performing very nicely. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll step away from the rest of our competitors in the macro. I just think it\u2019s unique to our portfolio.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Maybe just following-up on the last comment, Rich, can you give us a little more color what\u2019s going on in DCST? Obviously, you just mentioned CO2 systems, food retail in general is driving the outperformance. But how is it trending versus your original notifications for the year. Does the strength in food retail actually more than offset the continued weakness in heat exchangers to end up line upside in that segment?\nRichard J. Tobin: Yes. Look, I think that when Belvac was well known going into the year, and that was part of our plans. I think there was a lot of mixed signals around heat exchangers. I think we\u2019ve done a lot of work there. That\u2019s why I think that we\u2019re pretty confident to call the trough in Q3, and we would expect order rates actually to move up hopefully at the end of Q3, but clearly into Q4. I think on the food retail business, I think that CO2 is doing pretty much as planned, I think that what\u2019s doing better than planned as the margin performance of the business has just been exemplary through the quarter. So that\u2019s why when you look at the consolidated results, I don\u2019t think that we would expected food retail to offset the margin deletion from heat exchangers, but during the quarter, it did, which has been excellent.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard J. Tobin: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey Rich, just thinking about Slide 11 and everything you\u2019ve kind of here on gas and cryo and everything, you\u2019re characterizing it as kind of a component-driven strategy, and I get that margins are often very, very good in components. But it looks like you\u2019re also stitching it together with some automation and some other things. So maybe just kind of talk about what else, if anything, you need or want to do here as we think about another $3 billion in capital to deploy, is it sort of all in the same ZIP code? Or are there other kind of M&A vectors we\u2019ve got to be thinking about?\nRichard J. Tobin: Yes. I\u2019m hesitant to say \u2013 well, a couple of things, Jeff. What we\u2019re going to do, whether it\u2019s before the end of the year or very early next year, I think you heard from my comments that we\u2019re intending to re-segment and to give some more visibility here. When we do that, we\u2019re going to make an investor presentation. I\u2019m loath to say what we\u2019re interested in because this area has gotten some intention. So in an area that over the last previous couple of years where we\u2019ve been a buyer. Now we\u2019ve got some competition in this space. So I guess, I\u2019ll take a pass on saying what we\u2019d like to do in the future because I\u2019m not interested in attracting any more interest there.\nJeff Sprague: And then one of the things we\u2019ve seen out of Dover though, Rich, also is when you put these stakes in the ground you turn it up organically. I mean with your kind of flow and other competencies here, is there sort of a lot you can do organically to kind of expand your scope here? Or it would be mostly an M&A-driven strategy?\nRichard J. Tobin: There's two strategies here. I think, as I mentioned in the comments, we believe within 24 months, we can get this entire cluster of businesses, some of which are already performing here, but the entire cluster up into mid-20s EBITDA margin. And that will be through, number one, we think it's a growing area. So we're going to get some volume leverage there. But I think once we put our Dover playbook on back-office integration and all the things that you know about. I think that within 18, 24 months, we can drive the entire segment up there.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. And just a quick one on this whole heat pump question. You're talking about Europe, specifically the whole business broadly, the bottom in your business or it's the bottom then your customers' business, that whole kind of lead lag equation, everybody has been trying to sort out?\nRichard J. Tobin: Yes. Yes. Well, it's unfortunate that we were all never aligned between the components manufacturers of the end market. But the fact of the matter is we \u2013 like I said in the comments, we've spent a lot of time on trying to determine total inventory in the chain. We believe that the \u2013 and it's mostly European heat pumps because that's the vast majority of the volume in the first place. Heat pumps North America and then the balance of the world proportionately is relatively small. So we think that we trough in terms of volume in Q3 and our expectation based on discussions we have our customers, that inventory has been flushed and will go back to positive orders in Q4.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for the color.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go now to Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nRichard J. Tobin: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: So as far as the orders are concerned, can you just give us some I missed the first call minutes of the call, so you may have said this, but just some color on how you expect them to trend sequentially? And then should we expect normal seasonality off of that in the fourth quarter?\nRichard J. Tobin: Look, I think that book-to-bill should remain one or higher for the balance of the year. I think that we have in Q2, I think we actually did a little bit better than I would have expected in terms of production performance and the shipment, and that's why it drove the 5% organic growth, and that's at \u2013 that changes the metric, but I think that order rates we've got a good handle on. I think we stay above one for the balance of the year. Q4 generally is going to be a proxy on everybody's macro outlook of 25. But as I said before, I think that we roll into some easier comps than and something like SWEP should turn positive finally in Q4, if not at the end of the Q3. And I think the momentum that we're going to have in thermal biopharma, the momentum we have in CO2 all will contribute to staying above one.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just in the quarter, I know you guys had said flat sequentially, you were down a little bit. I know that's kind of nitpicking, but what was slower for you guys in that orders, just the one or two things that held that back a bit?\nRichard J. Tobin: Steve and I have to go through it. I'm sure that somebody took some outsized big orders in Q2 of the previous comparable I'd have to go dig through it. I'll get Jack to follow-up.\nJack Dickens: Yes. What we said organically, it was sequentially up marginally. So you got to take into effect the disposition of De-Sta-Co, the acquisition timing within the quarter and also FX, which was higher than we expected in the quarter, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, got it. Okay. Makes a lot of sense. Thank you.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go now to Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning.\nRichard J. Tobin: Hi.\nAndrew Obin: Again, just a question about sort of acquisitions. You're sort of increasing your exposure to green energy. But I think our sense is that at least for now, a lot of these orders are being not orders, just a lot of these projects have been pushed out over regulations. Sort of visibility on taxes, visibility on funding. I mean, clearly, it's an informed bet. And I think in May at our event in New York, we definitely talked about that quotation activity is very, very robust. Can you just sort of talk about what it is you're seeing over the next 12 to 24 months that makes you commit capital to the sector. And to make it clear, we\u2019re quite excited about it, but it does seem that near-term, there are some push outs? Just give us your view because you tend to think about these things? Thank you.\nRichard J. Tobin: Yes. I mean, Andrew, look, I mean, at the end of the day, you can\u2019t \u2013 when the market is there, it\u2019s too late to buy anything, right? So you need to basically take some bets on what you think has got secular growth behind it. So if we think about thematic at the end of the day, I mean, there\u2019s a whole stream of electrification. We\u2019re not chasing that meaningfully. We\u2019ve had a presence in the gas sector for decades. So we know the customers, we know the regulatory environment around it and everything else. So we\u2019re big believers in the \u2013 the electricity has got to come from somewhere, and we\u2019re big believers that the total gas complex is going to be an important contributor there. What we\u2019re buying are large installed base at the end of the day. So we\u2019re not paying on the comp to a certain extent. But cryogenic components and vacuum jacketed piping were kind of niche businesses in the past, but to the extent that cryogenic gas applications continues to expand, we would expand \u2013 we\u2019re mixed. We\u2019re buying these things and we\u2019re expanding capacity on top of them as we do it. So if we get the timing off a little bit, so be it at the end of the day, I think. But from a secular point of view, we\u2019re pretty confident of what we\u2019re doing.\nAndrew Obin: All right. Got you. And maybe a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing on DPPS, right? You\u2019re sort of highlighting year-over-year growth in biopharma. And then clearly, I think you\u2019re sort of talking about thermal connections. So what kind of growth can we think about \u2013 just two-part question. What kind of growth can we think about thermal connections? Can this business actually double over the next 12 months? And second on biopharma, when do we actually start growing year-over-year? Thank you.\nRichard J. Tobin: Well, we should grow year-over-year right this year, considering we probably bottomed in the mid to late of 2023, so that\u2019s good news. And on the thermal, look, it\u2019s a small base, but at the end of the day, our bookings are up significantly, and we would expect total revenue and earnings to be on target to what I think I gave you some numbers at the end of Q2 when we\u2019re tracking that way. I believe the thermal is going to be interesting, right? Because back to your question before between all the hype of everybody talking about it and then the lag period, I think that we\u2019re on the front foot for production capacity. I think that we\u2019ve got clean room production capacity, I think that we\u2019re going to be able to have 100% traceability by the end of the year, which should separate us for a lot of people that are going to try to get into this business. So if I step back at DPPS in total, we knew that Maag was cycled down after a three, four year run coming up. Industrial pumps is, I would call it, not robust right now, but that has been offset by precision components, which is really part of the exposure that we\u2019ve got into the gas complex and the mix effect of both biopharma and thermal connectors.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you very much.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Good morning, Rich and Brad.\nRichard J. Tobin: Hey, Scott.\nScott Davis: I wanted to go back to, I think, the second relative to Jeff\u2019s question really on Slide 11. Are there channel synergies? Are there synergies that are kind of tangible when you just look at the assets on this page, what \u2013 is it just commonality of end markets? Or are there actually some tangible synergies and benefits of bringing them all together under one segment? Assuming you do get...\nRichard J. Tobin: Sure. Yes. I mean we bought RegO and Acme at the end of 2021. So Maag basically is an overlap adjacency to that \u2013 to those prior period acquisitions. So it\u2019s just \u2013 think about just adding a bunch of new products under a footprint that we already have. There is a manufacturing footprint opportunity there, clearly, both inbound and reverse synergy on the footprint. These are global businesses. So part of the reason that we did Demaco is you just can't say I'm a North American provider. You have to have \u2013 when you're dealing with companies like Linde, you need to have a European presence. So that's why we purchased Demaco to kind of make our presence in Europe larger at the end of the day. And so what we're kind of building A lot of the times, they're the same customer. A lot of the times, they're adjacencies, but the regulatory and safety requirements to build those kind of components are very common, and it's just an ability that we have.\nScott Davis: Okay. And just following up, your bullish M&A comments, I think last quarter was trending in this direction, too. I mean is it a commentary more on asset availability or valuation or both?\nRichard J. Tobin: More asset availability. I mean, look, we've been hearing about it was supposed to be 2023 [ph] than it was supposed to be 2024 [ph]. And now it's \u2013 we're beginning to see assets coming out of PE, but our expectation is the process is going to accelerate I think everybody has been waiting for an interest rate cut to kind of flex it. I mean the equity markets have been doing relatively well, and that is helpful in terms of not to us in terms of buying, but it's helpful for exit. From a PE point of view. So we've been kind of waiting for this opportunity for a couple of years now, and I think that we're kind of bullish that we'll see if we get them done, right? We're going to not start drawing money around like drunk and sellers, but I think that we're on the front foot of \u2013 we think there's going to be a lot of opportunity going forward. And now with the monetization of ESG, we're a cash buyer. So that puts us in a good spot.\nScott Davis: Yes, good luck. Thank you.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Brett Linzey with Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: Hi, good morning all. Just, I just wanted to come back to the ESG divestiture. So you called out the dollar of dilution to adjusted EPS on Slide 8. You've announced a couple of deals here. How are you thinking about the backfill? Do you have line of sight to more than offset with M&A? Or should we think about a balance of repo in M&A?\nRichard J. Tobin: I think that our bias would be towards M&A. But I think we've got a history of \u2013 we don't sit on cash for a prolonged period of time. The good news now is unlike a couple of years ago, we actually get some yield off our cash. If we rewind the clock back cash three years ago, you've got nothing for it. So yields right now on cash balances, let's just call it, 5% or so. that's not bad. So we can be a little bit more patient, if you will. And if you heard me answer the last question, we think there's going to be a lot of M&A opportunity coming forward. So, I think our bias is probably a lot more towards M&A than share repurchase than it's been over the previous three years to four years.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on free cash flow. So thinking about the composition of ESG out, some of these more recurring businesses into the mix. How should we think about free cash flow margin as you evolve the portfolio and you're buying more recurring cash flow?\nRichard J. Tobin: Well, I mean, like the ESG actually from a working capital point of view is a pretty good performer. But \u2013 so the benefit would be on the gross margin, right? So what we're bringing in gross margin up, so profitability up. So the like-for-like swap of dollar of revenue should be better from the cash\u2026\nBrad Cerepak: Should be better, yes.\nBrett Linzey: Great. Good quarter. Thanks.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. One segment that doesn't get a little airtime is DII, but it had a very impressive bookings, organic sales growth, margin performance in Q2. And I suppose on the revenue front, a good turnaround year-on-year from what happened second half of last year and into Q1 of this year. So I'm just trying to understand that the growth drivers there. And again, comps are pretty easy in the second half and on sales and the bookings growth was good in Q2. So just trying to understand kind of how strong could that growth be in the back half? And I realize the incrementals are exceptional to a degree with mix, but should we see at least very strong incrementals again in the second half?\nRichard J. Tobin: Yes. That's hard to say, right? I think at the end of the day, you have a pretty strong mix effect in Q2, right, because of consumables being proportionately higher than kind of average, I mean printer shipments actually dilute margins at the end of the day. So the per dollar shipment value is higher. But the margin dollars per revenue comes down a little bit. Look, we're really happy with the margin performance. This business over the long run [ph] is a steady eddy. I think the management has done a great job of moving the margin up through more or less efficiency more than anything else. So we'd expect that to continue. But I wouldn't be surprised if you saw a little bit of margin dilution in the second half, especially if printer shipments move up proportionally to the consumables.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. And then just \u2013 I know you don't give much understandable, you don't give much color on the sort of quarterly cadence of earnings, but we're halfway through the year. And the seasonality has been confusing in recent years. So I just wondered sort of when we think about third and fourth quarter total Dover earnings sequentially, if you like, is it sort of Q3 up a bit sequentially on earnings and then down sequentially in Q4? Is that the way to think about it?\nRichard J. Tobin: Yes. Well, the way we think about it is Q1, Q2 and Q3 tend to be up and then Q4 usually is a flex quarter, and it depends on order rates and whether we drive for cash, we're really bullish on 2025 and whether we build inventory or not in Q4. I would I think that, that kind of sequential performance is going to hold for this year. And that's what we've built into our forecast.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go now to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey guys. Good morning.\nRichard J. Tobin: Good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, so I'm going to start on ESG because Rich, I guess I was \u2013 maybe I was the only one that was surprised that you guys ended up selling the business. I just thought of it as being a good margin, good return type business. I'm curious kind of what went into that decision as you thought about evaluating that asset over the long term?\nRichard J. Tobin: I don't know, Joe, I think that we've been fielding questions on the capital goods portion of our portfolio as long as I've been here. And we had said at least initially that we thought that we could improve the performance of the business. So that we were going to be patient and wait if someone was interested in it that we were going to wait to make sure that we are paid appropriately for it. I mean, I know that there's lots of different calculations about what we were paid, but the bottom line is on a, call it, a Q1 exit LTM basis, we got 13x EBITDA. And I come from capital goods. So the three premier companies and capital goods in the United States are PACCAR, Deere and Caterpillar and look where they trade on an EBITDA multiple basis. So at that point, that we think that we can monetize there. We should because at the end of the day, from a summer parts point of view, we get a capital goods multiple in that business. It's one of our \u2013 I don't want to talk to business down because the management team did a phenomenal job in terms of the performance of it, but the bottom line is it's one of our lowest gross margin businesses in the portfolio. So to the extent that we need to kind of mix up over time, and we're paid appropriately. I think that that's the way we look at it.\nJoe Ritchie: That's super helpful. And then I guess just my follow-up question and maybe just kind of talking about some of the other longer cycle pieces of your portfolio. So I'm thinking SWEP, Belvac and MAAG, what's kind of the expectation embedded into guidance for growth for those businesses this year? And is it too early to maybe start talking about 2025 and what those businesses could do?\nRichard J. Tobin: Look, I think that SWEP [indiscernible] heat exchange or heat pump debate, I think has been beaten to death at this point. Everybody got very excited. The problem with having exposure to subsidize products. It's great when they're subsidized. It's not so great when they're not subsidized. So we're just going to have to deal with that. So if I take that away and I looked at SWEP over time, we actually don't think that, that is a cyclical long-cycle business. We think that, that's just a component parts business that just went through a kind of an adoption rate on heat pumps through legislation in Europe that we're not going to apologize for when the market was there, you seize the market. So I think once we get through this whole period, which hopefully knock wood will be at the end of Q3 that, that would just go back to being a non-cyclical asset going forward from here. Maag is a little bit more CapEx driven. Belvac is a little bit more CapEx driven. I will say that Maag is likely to be less cyclical than it's been in the past because I think the management team. Has done a really good job opening up the vectors in terms of what we sell, and there's actually a pretty large installed spare parts business there. Belvac is always going to be cyclical, but that's not a tail that's going to wag the dog. It's just not that big in our portfolio.\nJoe Ritchie: Yes. It's super helpful. Thank you.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll hear now from Mike Halloran with Baird.\nMike Halloran: Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nRichard J. Tobin: Hi Mike.\nMike Halloran: Just one for me, [indiscernible] 2 part of this. So as you think about the short-cycle trends, you talked about some choppiness in the order patterns through the quarter. Maybe just talk about how you're thinking about the short-cycle trends? And then secondarily, if there are any leading indicators in those end markets or product categories where you're seeing signs of concern or inversely \u2013 conversely, excuse me, signs of acceleration? Thanks.\nRichard J. Tobin: That's \u2013 I don't want to march through the entire portfolio. It's just been choppy all year in short cycle. I think distribution is still digesting higher interest costs. The GDP print today was good, at least for North America, it's not been great out of Europe for a period of time. So there's a lot of uncertainty of kind of what the catalyst is for demand. So I think I mentioned in my earlier comments, like intra-quarter volatility of order rates we have like heart attacks around here week-over-week because it kind of flexes all over the place. But when you let the tide go out we're still growing the top line. I think that the areas that we know that are in cyclical down trends, we've got a handle on that. I'd like to see fueling do better. I think that, that's been a little bit slower than we would have expected through the first half. We're going to keep a close eye on order rates there going into the second half. And our expectation is because we've got easier comps in the second half that by and large, the hurdle rate for orders is in Herculean.\nMike Halloran: Thanks Rich.\nRichard J. Tobin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go now to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRichard J. Tobin: Good morning.\nBrad Cerepak: Deane, how are you?\nDeane Dray: Rich, I really like seeing this pivot into a higher up the technology curve, these critical components that are typically a lower cost of the project. And I know you're not going to kind of reveal exactly the areas that you're moving into. But you did \u2013 you characterize ESG divestiture as pivoting away from capital goods. And then Joe, your answer to Joe's question, you gave some color there, but there are still lots of capital goods exposures in the portfolio. So where do you draw the line? What's the timing? You've made lots of margin improvements. You said that was kind of the gating factor. But where do you draw the line? And how much change can the organization take at just a given point in time?\nRichard J. Tobin: There's nothing that we have to sell, Deane, and we didn't have to sell ESG either, right? And if I go and look on return on invested capital in ESG it's been great, right? Because the earnings \u2013 the earnings improvement has been terrific. It's an older asset. So you got to always be careful with ROIC because its asset base has been depreciated over a long period of time. So it gets a little bit flatter there. But I don't want to repeat myself, but we spend an inordinate amount of time here doing our own sum of parts on every piece of this portfolio. So we've got a clear understanding at what hurdle rates are for monetization. But we're not going to win to address the portfolio and sell things at below intrinsic value, just to make the gross margin go up by 50 basis points. So, I can't tell you about the timing. We'll just going to have to be patient. And what we see when we go over there, I think that the important issue to understand is that we've got optionality in terms of firepower that a lot of people don't have, meaning that we can lever up on an M&A front and then delever by monetization. That's not what we did here. I think we were just more opportunistic, but that is something that's an arrow in our quiver going forward.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. Thank you for that context. And then just a question for Brad. There's an expectation of working capital improvements in the second half. Can you give us some color there or any specifics? And then what about \u2013 what should we be thinking about buybacks for the second half?\nBrad Cerepak: Well, I think, Rich, I take the second part of that question first. I think Rich already answered that in a sense that our priority is around capital deployment to M&A, especially as we move here into the second half with market conditions of available assets that we see. So I think that's a positive thing for us as we move through the year. In terms of the trajectory on working capital and cash flow, I mean really, it's no different than last year when you think about it. I mean we're on pace with the prior year. We have good line of sight in terms of what we need to do in the back half around inventory and receivables, and it's all highly achievable in the same pattern that we saw last year. So we have pretty good confidence. We have confidence in the 13% to 15% at this stage.\nDeane Dray: Thank you.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question today from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks for taking me in guys. Good morning. Look, I know there's been a lot of questions on the cryogenic kind of strategy. But the Marshall Excelsior deal looks really interesting. And the 10 points of synergies that you called out, kind of got my attention. So maybe just Rich remind us, what sort of growth do you expect the market to kind of compound out for the next three years to five years. With this cluster of businesses, do you think you can gain share and outgrow that market? And maybe just \u2013 I don't know if you can tell us this, but what is the entry margin for the Marshall deal?\nRichard J. Tobin: Okay. Well, I don't have to remind you about the growth rate, because I don't think we ever gave you one.\nNigel Coe: Okay.\nRichard J. Tobin: Look, we're going to give you like \u2013 you may have missed it at the beginning, I think that because we built this platform, our intention is to resegment it into its own platform. And when we do that, we're going to give you a presentation of long-term growth outlook and everything else. I can tell you that the profile of what we've been buying has been around 20% margin \u2013 and I think then between synergy value and accelerated growth, we think within a 24-month period, we can get it to 25% EBITDA margin. So that's kind of the economics behind it.\nNigel Coe: Yes. Sorry, I missed the first part of the call, so I missed that detail.\nRichard J. Tobin: No problem.\nNigel Coe: And the 10 points, would that be primarily cost or is it exclusively cost? Or is there some ready synergy as well?\nRichard J. Tobin: No revenue synergy. It's all we know \u2013 you've seen us make the presentations before about back-office consolidation and all those things that we have. We've got a whole system that's in place in this particular case. We actually think we've got some backward integration footprint opportunity here from our legacy businesses. So those are really the two big pieces.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Rich. And then just for Brad, just some details on the ESG. So the discontinuation, is that on a go-forward basis, so that will be a second half impact? Or do you have to go back and discontinue for the first half as well? And then is it \u2013 do you have any sense yet on the tax leakage on the deal?\nBrad Cerepak: Yes. So as it relates to discontinued ops, it would be all prior periods presented. So we really restate everything. Once we get to a point in time here later in the third quarter, we'll be taking a hard look at that and they probably dropped at that point in time, and you'll see all the restatements filed in advance. So we have that data in advance. And on tax leakage, you should just assume a normalized U.S. type of tax rate, 21% or so in the leakage.\nNigel Coe: Okay, thanks, Brad.\nBrad Cerepak: It's very possible that, that cash tax is unlike De-Sta-Co goes out this year. So we're looking at that timing as well.\nNigel Coe: Okay. But that wouldn't be in your guide, right, for the free cash flow, that would be...\nBrad Cerepak: No, we'll handle the same way we handle the De-Sta-Co by adjusting free cash flow.\nNigel Coe: Great. Okay. Thanks, Brad.\nBrad Cerepak: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Okay. I'm on Slide 6. The top bridge shows our organic revenue growth of 5% and the De-Sta-Co sale, which was closed on March 31, more than offset acquisition-related revenue of \u2013 by $9 million, while FX was a headwind of approximately $13 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was up 11% in the quarter on solid broad-based activity with particular strength in waste handling and food retail. Europe and all of Asia was down 4% and 9%, respectively. China, which represents half our revenue base in Asia was down 8% organically in the quarter, primarily due to shipment timing within polymer processing. On the bottom of the chart, bookings were up year-over-year. Of note, orders were also marginally up sequentially on an organic basis quarter-to-quarter. Below-the-line items negatively impacted our earnings in the quarter, driven by a higher tax rate as well as higher corporate costs net of interest due in part to elevated deal expenses. Now on our cash flow statement, Slide 7. Adjusting for taxes paid on the gain De-Sta-Co, which are non-operational in nature, our free cash flow came in at 10% of revenue in the quarter, up $64 million year-over-year. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow is essentially flat versus the prior period despite investments in working capital due to shipment timing driving higher receivable balances as well as investments in inventory due to strong bookings rates. We expect to materially liquidate our working capital balances over the second half of the year and are on track to deliver our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of 13% to 15% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich. We can here you, Andy. Go ahead. Should be better, yes. Hi, Joe. Deane, how are you? Well, I think, Rich, I take the second part of that question first. I think Rich already answered that in a sense that our priority is around capital deployment to M&A, especially as we move here into the second half with market conditions of available assets that we see. So I think that's a positive thing for us as we move through the year. In terms of the trajectory on working capital and cash flow, I mean really, it's no different than last year when you think about it. I mean we're on pace with the prior year. We have good line of sight in terms of what we need to do in the back half around inventory and receivables, and it's all highly achievable in the same pattern that we saw last year.

No, we'll handle the same way we handle the De-Sta-Co by adjusting free cash flow. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Jack. I'm on Slide 3. Second quarter results were solid, driven by excellent production and shipment performance against our order book. Strong revenue performance was broad-based across our end market and geographic exposures with four out of five segments posting top line growth. Organic revenue was up 5% for the quarter. Bookings were up 16% organically year-over-year, continuing their upward trajectory over the last several quarters and bolstering our confidence in our second half outlook. Margin performance was excellent, up 200 basis points over the prior year to 22.1%, driven by volume leverage, organic and inorganic mix, proactive cost management and rigorous productivity actions. Our strong operational results were complemented by ongoing portfolio evolution actions. Over the last week, we have completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions, enhancing our clean energy components platform, adding applications in highly attractive end markets, expanding our global reach and strategically expanding our manufacturing base into new regions. We also recently announced the sale of our Environmental Services Group business unit for $2 billion in cash. This transaction, together with the sale of De-Sta-Co in March of this year, reflects our intention to reduce our exposure to capital goods, we have monetized these businesses where we have materially improved operating performance at attractive exit multiples while methodically migrating our portfolio toward higher organic growth and margin opportunities. We are approaching the second half of the year constructively. The underlying end market demand is healthy and is supported by our sustained order rates. We are, therefore, raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $9.05 to $9.20. I'll skip to Slide 4. Engineered Products had another robust quarter, driven particularly strong volume growth and conversion of waste handling and aerospace and defense. Volumes of vehicle aftermarket grew in recovering European market conditions and improved production performance. We expect volumes to remain strong for the segment through 2024. Margin performance was solid in the quarter on strong volume conversion, favorable mix and productivity. Clean energy and fueling was up 2% organically in the quarter on solid volumes in clean energy components where we're starting to see robust quoting activity and order rate momentum from component parts tied to large projects in hydrogen and cryogenic applications. Volumes were also solid in software systems and above-ground retail fueling continued its positive recovery, particularly in the U.S. Margins were flat in the quarter as proactive cost curtailment offset volumes and mix. Imaging and ID posted an excellent quarter on growth in serialization software and strong shipments from marking and coding consumables and aftermarket parts. Printer shipments were still subdued, improved sequentially and should inflect positively in the second half. Margin performance was exemplary on SG&A leverage and a higher mix of consumables and aftermarket shipments. Pumps and Process Solutions was down organically as expected, principally due to lower shipments in our long-cycle polymer processing business partially offsetting these headwinds were significant growth in shipments and new bookings for thermal connectors tied to AI chip liquid cooling applications and data centers as well as a solid quarter in precision components. Both orders and shipments of single-use biopharma components grew sequentially and year-over-year continuing to post-COVID recovery. Margins in the segment were up on mix and operational execution. Top line performance and Climate & Sustainability Technologies outperformed our internal estimates due to an exceptional quarter in food retail which nearly offset the capital investment slowdown in beverage can making an impact of destocking headwinds in the broader HVAC complex, most notably in European residential heat pumps, on our European brazed plate heat exchanger business. We expect these headwinds to persist in the second half, with heat pump-related shipments troughing in the third quarter. Margin performance was exceptional driven particularly by food retail, which posted all-time record margin in the quarter on strong volume conversion and a greater mix of CO2 systems shipments. I'll pass it to Brad here. Thanks Brad. I am on Slide 8. Here, we provide some visibility into the contribution of the portfolio of both the ESG divestiture and the recently closed acquisitions in clean energy components providers, Marshall Excelsior and Demaco. These transactions continue our purposeful portfolio migration away from capital goods towards higher gross margin, less cyclical and higher growth component businesses, that serve secular, advantaged end markets. We have been methodical and disciplined in our approach to enhancing the portfolio through acquisitions and patient in our strategic divestitures. We are pleased with the valuations of our two recent divestitures within Engineered Products, ESG announced on Monday and De-Sta-Co, which closed in March that both achieved above 13 times trailing EBITDA multiples, significant premiums for capital goods assets. The transaction details are on the page. Due to the timing of the ESG signing and uncertainty of the closing date, we have left ESG in our full year guidance for now. We expect to move ESG discontinued ops in Q3 earnings report, and we'll recast our historical financials and guidance at that time. The ESG earnings profile is shown on the page. And importantly, we are not including any benefit of the transaction proceeds toward value-added capital deployment. We believe we are entering a 12- to 18-month period that represents a unique buying opportunity for attractive assets including many private equity-owned businesses that are overdue for exits in our highest priority areas of inorganic expansion. Our current balance sheet strength and cash flow forecast reinforced by the proceeds of the ESG divestiture positioned us well to remain on the front foot in pursuit of attractive capital deployment opportunities. Let's go to Slide 9. I wanted to provide a little more color on our collection of businesses that provide critical flow control and safety components for industrial gas, cryogenics, natural gas and clean energy applications. These businesses span across both our pumps and process solutions and clean energy and fueling segments, so there is significant commonality in industrial tailwinds and business models. These businesses provide highly engineered components that serve demanding applications in the broader clean energy and industrial gas complexes and there are growing requirements for sustainability, emissions reduction and safety that create favorable product loyalty dynamics and innovation opportunities for us. Our positions in these attractive markets are supported by strong and recognized technological and application expertise and intellectual property with large installed bases that drive reoccurring replacement demand as well as exposure to high growth uses like hydrogen and LNG. We have been active acquirers in the space investing roughly $2 billion over the last several years. We believe these investments should generate mid to high-digit growth at margins accretive to our consolidated portfolio over the long run. This remains a high priority area investment for us moving forward. In light of our recent divestitures, with the scale of this critical component platform now reaching $1 billion of revenue, we intend to readdress our current segment structure in the near future to add focus and disclosures around our growth platforms. Slide 10 provides a little bit more color on Marshall Excelsior, the larger of the two energy businesses that we've acquired in the last week. MEC's acquisition broadens our portfolio in cryogenic valves and other components and expands our participation in several applications, including the expansion into remote monitoring and digital controls in cryogenic transport and severe duty valves providing an excellent opportunity for cross-selling. Integrating MEC into our existing clean energy platforms and centralized support functions should provide significant cost savings. We expect to capture about $12 million in run rate synergies driving MEC to high 20s margin and high single-digit ROIC by year three. Taking a step back, shows the broad scope of our offering within clean energy applications. We're supplying a variety of safety-critical components like valves, regulators, nozzles, loading arms, dispensing and gas handling equipment for a variety of applications across the high, the whole cryogenic gas value chain from production to consumption. We serve both gas and liquefied gas applications with multiple molecules handled, including LNG, hydrogen propane, oxygen and nitrogen, among others, and we're benefiting from strong investment momentum by industrial gas majors and global government infrastructure spending. While a smaller deal for us, Demaco was also closed last week, providing us a very important European base of manufacturing to enhance our growth and global scale. Finally, on Slide 12 shows the long-term performance of the portfolio. We continued to deliver earnings growth through a combination of top line organic growth, margin improvement through operational execution and returns on productive capital deployment strategies to methodically improve our portfolio over time. Our strong balance sheet position will be further enhanced by the proceeds of the ESG divestiture in the second half of the year. We expect to end the year with approximately $3 billion in capital deployment firepower from cash and reasonable leverage levels. We have a number of levers available to deliver the second half of the flexible business model can quickly respond to changes in our dynamic markets. I'd like to end by thanking ESG President, Pat Carroll and his entire management team for the value they created for Dover shareholders under their tenure. With that, let's go to Q&A. Hi, good morning. Yes, I would expect it to be over one. As you know, I think that our comps are either in the second half of the year from an order basis. It's been a little bit lumpy, I have to say, intra-quarter. So we'll see how it goes, but our expectation is to be over one for the balance of the year. And I think that's reflected if you take a look at our full year forecast in terms of revenue growth and everything else. The outperformance \u2013 look, I mean, I think at the end of the day, we led in, we led it out, and we're probably leading in again. So as we've discussed previously, I think that our inventory positions are well placed and some of the markets that we have exposure to that have suffered over the previous 24 months or making a turn. We add on top of that some of the growth platforms like we have like thermal connectors and CO2 systems, which are performing very nicely. So I don't \u2013 I think it's \u2013 I'll step away from the rest of our competitors in the macro. I just think it's unique to our portfolio. Yes. Look, I think that when Belvac was well known going into the year, and that was part of our plans. I think there was a lot of mixed signals around heat exchangers. I think we've done a lot of work there. That's why I think that we're pretty confident to call the trough in Q3, and we would expect order rates actually to move up hopefully at the end of Q3, but clearly into Q4. I think on the food retail business, I think that CO2 is doing pretty much as planned, I think that what's doing better than planned as the margin performance of the business has just been exemplary through the quarter. So that's why when you look at the consolidated results, I don't think that we would expected food retail to offset the margin deletion from heat exchangers, but during the quarter, it did, which has been excellent. Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Yes. I'm hesitant to say \u2013 well, a couple of things, Jeff. What we're going to do, whether it's before the end of the year or very early next year, I think you heard from my comments that we're intending to re-segment and to give some more visibility here. When we do that, we're going to make an investor presentation. I'm loath to say what we're interested in because this area has gotten some intention. So in an area that over the last previous couple of years where we've been a buyer. Now we've got some competition in this space. So I guess, I'll take a pass on saying what we'd like to do in the future because I'm not interested in attracting any more interest there. There's two strategies here. I think, as I mentioned in the comments, we believe within 24 months, we can get this entire cluster of businesses, some of which are already performing here, but the entire cluster up into mid-20s EBITDA margin. And that will be through, number one, we think it's a growing area. So we're going to get some volume leverage there. But I think once we put our Dover playbook on back-office integration and all the things that you know about. I think that within 18, 24 months, we can drive the entire segment up there. Yes. Yes. Well, it's unfortunate that we were all never aligned between the components manufacturers of the end market. But the fact of the matter is we \u2013 like I said in the comments, we've spent a lot of time on trying to determine total inventory in the chain. We believe that the \u2013 and it's mostly European heat pumps because that's the vast majority of the volume in the first place. Heat pumps North America and then the balance of the world proportionately is relatively small. So we think that we trough in terms of volume in Q3 and our expectation based on discussions we have our customers, that inventory has been flushed and will go back to positive orders in Q4. Thanks. Good morning, Steve. Look, I think that book-to-bill should remain one or higher for the balance of the year. I think that we have in Q2, I think we actually did a little bit better than I would have expected in terms of production performance and the shipment, and that's why it drove the 5% organic growth, and that's at \u2013 that changes the metric, but I think that order rates we've got a good handle on. I think we stay above one for the balance of the year. Q4 generally is going to be a proxy on everybody's macro outlook of 25. But as I said before, I think that we roll into some easier comps than and something like SWEP should turn positive finally in Q4, if not at the end of the Q3. And I think the momentum that we're going to have in thermal biopharma, the momentum we have in CO2 all will contribute to staying above one. Steve and I have to go through it. I'm sure that somebody took some outsized big orders in Q2 of the previous comparable I'd have to go dig through it. I'll get Jack to follow-up. Thanks. Hi. Yes. I mean, Andrew, look, I mean, at the end of the day, you can't \u2013 when the market is there, it's too late to buy anything, right? So you need to basically take some bets on what you think has got secular growth behind it. So if we think about thematic at the end of the day, I mean, there's a whole stream of electrification. We're not chasing that meaningfully. We've had a presence in the gas sector for decades. So we know the customers, we know the regulatory environment around it and everything else. So we're big believers in the \u2013 the electricity has got to come from somewhere, and we're big believers that the total gas complex is going to be an important contributor there. What we're buying are large installed base at the end of the day. So we're not paying on the comp to a certain extent. But cryogenic components and vacuum jacketed piping were kind of niche businesses in the past, but to the extent that cryogenic gas applications continues to expand, we would expand \u2013 we're mixed. We're buying these things and we're expanding capacity on top of them as we do it. So if we get the timing off a little bit, so be it at the end of the day, I think. But from a secular point of view, we're pretty confident of what we're doing. Well, we should grow year-over-year right this year, considering we probably bottomed in the mid to late of 2023, so that's good news. And on the thermal, look, it's a small base, but at the end of the day, our bookings are up significantly, and we would expect total revenue and earnings to be on target to what I think I gave you some numbers at the end of Q2 when we're tracking that way. I believe the thermal is going to be interesting, right? Because back to your question before between all the hype of everybody talking about it and then the lag period, I think that we're on the front foot for production capacity. I think that we've got clean room production capacity, I think that we're going to be able to have 100% traceability by the end of the year, which should separate us for a lot of people that are going to try to get into this business. So if I step back at DPPS in total, we knew that Maag was cycled down after a three, four year run coming up. Industrial pumps is, I would call it, not robust right now, but that has been offset by precision components, which is really part of the exposure that we've got into the gas complex and the mix effect of both biopharma and thermal connectors. Thanks. Hey, Scott. Sure. Yes. I mean we bought RegO and Acme at the end of 2021. So Maag basically is an overlap adjacency to that \u2013 to those prior period acquisitions. So it's just \u2013 think about just adding a bunch of new products under a footprint that we already have. There is a manufacturing footprint opportunity there, clearly, both inbound and reverse synergy on the footprint. These are global businesses. So part of the reason that we did Demaco is you just can't say I'm a North American provider. You have to have \u2013 when you're dealing with companies like Linde, you need to have a European presence. So that's why we purchased Demaco to kind of make our presence in Europe larger at the end of the day. And so what we're kind of building A lot of the times, they're the same customer. A lot of the times, they're adjacencies, but the regulatory and safety requirements to build those kind of components are very common, and it's just an ability that we have. More asset availability. I mean, look, we've been hearing about it was supposed to be 2023 [ph] than it was supposed to be 2024 [ph]. And now it's \u2013 we're beginning to see assets coming out of PE, but our expectation is the process is going to accelerate I think everybody has been waiting for an interest rate cut to kind of flex it. I mean the equity markets have been doing relatively well, and that is helpful in terms of not to us in terms of buying, but it's helpful for exit. From a PE point of view. So we've been kind of waiting for this opportunity for a couple of years now, and I think that we're kind of bullish that we'll see if we get them done, right? We're going to not start drawing money around like drunk and sellers, but I think that we're on the front foot of \u2013 we think there's going to be a lot of opportunity going forward. And now with the monetization of ESG, we're a cash buyer. So that puts us in a good spot. Thanks. I think that our bias would be towards M&A. But I think we've got a history of \u2013 we don't sit on cash for a prolonged period of time. The good news now is unlike a couple of years ago, we actually get some yield off our cash. If we rewind the clock back cash three years ago, you've got nothing for it. So yields right now on cash balances, let's just call it, 5% or so. that's not bad. So we can be a little bit more patient, if you will. And if you heard me answer the last question, we think there's going to be a lot of M&A opportunity coming forward. So, I think our bias is probably a lot more towards M&A than share repurchase than it's been over the previous three years to four years. Well, I mean, like the ESG actually from a working capital point of view is a pretty good performer. But \u2013 so the benefit would be on the gross margin, right? So what we're bringing in gross margin up, so profitability up. So the like-for-like swap of dollar of revenue should be better from the cash... Thanks. Yes. That's hard to say, right? I think at the end of the day, you have a pretty strong mix effect in Q2, right, because of consumables being proportionately higher than kind of average, I mean printer shipments actually dilute margins at the end of the day. So the per dollar shipment value is higher. But the margin dollars per revenue comes down a little bit. Look, we're really happy with the margin performance. This business over the long run [ph] is a steady eddy. I think the management has done a great job of moving the margin up through more or less efficiency more than anything else. So we'd expect that to continue. But I wouldn't be surprised if you saw a little bit of margin dilution in the second half, especially if printer shipments move up proportionally to the consumables. Yes. Well, the way we think about it is Q1, Q2 and Q3 tend to be up and then Q4 usually is a flex quarter, and it depends on order rates and whether we drive for cash, we're really bullish on 2025 and whether we build inventory or not in Q4. I would I think that, that kind of sequential performance is going to hold for this year. And that's what we've built into our forecast. Thanks. Good morning. I don't know, Joe, I think that we've been fielding questions on the capital goods portion of our portfolio as long as I've been here. And we had said at least initially that we thought that we could improve the performance of the business. So that we were going to be patient and wait if someone was interested in it that we were going to wait to make sure that we are paid appropriately for it. I mean, I know that there's lots of different calculations about what we were paid, but the bottom line is on a, call it, a Q1 exit LTM basis, we got 13x EBITDA. And I come from capital goods. So the three premier companies and capital goods in the United States are PACCAR, Deere and Caterpillar and look where they trade on an EBITDA multiple basis. So at that point, that we think that we can monetize there. We should because at the end of the day, from a summer parts point of view, we get a capital goods multiple in that business. It's one of our \u2013 I don't want to talk to business down because the management team did a phenomenal job in terms of the performance of it, but the bottom line is it's one of our lowest gross margin businesses in the portfolio. So to the extent that we need to kind of mix up over time, and we're paid appropriately. I think that that's the way we look at it. Look, I think that SWEP [indiscernible] heat exchange or heat pump debate, I think has been beaten to death at this point. Everybody got very excited. The problem with having exposure to subsidize products. It's great when they're subsidized. It's not so great when they're not subsidized. So we're just going to have to deal with that. So if I take that away and I looked at SWEP over time, we actually don't think that, that is a cyclical long-cycle business. We think that, that's just a component parts business that just went through a kind of an adoption rate on heat pumps through legislation in Europe that we're not going to apologize for when the market was there, you seize the market. So I think once we get through this whole period, which hopefully knock wood will be at the end of Q3 that, that would just go back to being a non-cyclical asset going forward from here. Maag is a little bit more CapEx driven. Belvac is a little bit more CapEx driven. I will say that Maag is likely to be less cyclical than it's been in the past because I think the management team. Has done a really good job opening up the vectors in terms of what we sell, and there's actually a pretty large installed spare parts business there. Belvac is always going to be cyclical, but that's not a tail that's going to wag the dog. It's just not that big in our portfolio. Thanks. Hi Mike. That's \u2013 I don't want to march through the entire portfolio. It's just been choppy all year in short cycle. I think distribution is still digesting higher interest costs. The GDP print today was good, at least for North America, it's not been great out of Europe for a period of time. So there's a lot of uncertainty of kind of what the catalyst is for demand. So I think I mentioned in my earlier comments, like intra-quarter volatility of order rates we have like heart attacks around here week-over-week because it kind of flexes all over the place. But when you let the tide go out we're still growing the top line. I think that the areas that we know that are in cyclical down trends, we've got a handle on that. I'd like to see fueling do better. I think that, that's been a little bit slower than we would have expected through the first half. We're going to keep a close eye on order rates there going into the second half. And our expectation is because we've got easier comps in the second half that by and large, the hurdle rate for orders is in Herculean. Thanks. Good morning. There's nothing that we have to sell, Deane, and we didn't have to sell ESG either, right? And if I go and look on return on invested capital in ESG it's been great, right? Because the earnings \u2013 the earnings improvement has been terrific. It's an older asset. So you got to always be careful with ROIC because its asset base has been depreciated over a long period of time. So it gets a little bit flatter there. But I don't want to repeat myself, but we spend an inordinate amount of time here doing our own sum of parts on every piece of this portfolio. So we've got a clear understanding at what hurdle rates are for monetization. But we're not going to win to address the portfolio and sell things at below intrinsic value, just to make the gross margin go up by 50 basis points. So, I can't tell you about the timing. We'll just going to have to be patient. And what we see when we go over there, I think that the important issue to understand is that we've got optionality in terms of firepower that a lot of people don't have, meaning that we can lever up on an M&A front and then delever by monetization. That's not what we did here. I think we were just more opportunistic, but that is something that's an arrow in our quiver going forward. Okay. Well, I don't have to remind you about the growth rate, because I don't think we ever gave you one. Look, we're going to give you like \u2013 you may have missed it at the beginning, I think that because we built this platform, our intention is to resegment it into its own platform. And when we do that, we're going to give you a presentation of long-term growth outlook and everything else. I can tell you that the profile of what we've been buying has been around 20% margin \u2013 and I think then between synergy value and accelerated growth, we think within a 24-month period, we can get it to 25% EBITDA margin. So that's kind of the economics behind it. No problem. No revenue synergy. It's all we know \u2013 you've seen us make the presentations before about back-office consolidation and all those things that we have. We've got a whole system that's in place in this particular case. We actually think we've got some backward integration footprint opportunity here from our legacy businesses. So those are really the two big pieces."

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director, Investor Relations. \n [Operator Instructions] \n As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you.\n I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir. \nJack Dickens: Thank you, Natalie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. \n An audio version of this call will be available on our website through May 16, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich. \nRichard Tobin: Thanks, Jack. \n Let's go to Slide 3. First quarter results were in line with our expectations. Strong performance across several of our end markets together with improving order and shipment trends in biopharma components and growth platforms, we're able to offset the counter cyclicality some of our long-cycle portfolio in what was expected to be our toughest comparable quarter this year. It is clear that our operating posture that we took in the second half of 2023 to proactively curtail production has had its intended effect. \n Customer and channel inventories are now largely in balance with prevailing demand conditions and level set to normalize lead times. As a result, order momentum in the quarter was strong and broad-based, particularly in our shorter-cycle end markets, building off an exit rate from last year and bolstering our confidence full year outlook. We remain active on capital deployment. \n During the quarter, we closed 2 synergistic bolt-on acquisitions that add attractive digital and reoccurring revenue streams to our retail fueling and carwash platforms. The DE-STA-CO of divestiture closed at the end of March as part of our ongoing portfolio evolution. We also launched a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program at the end of February to return excess capital to our shareholders. Our strong cash flow generation along with the proceeds of the DE-STA-CO sale provide ample capacity for further capital deployment in 2024. \n We're off to a solid start to the year and the setup for the remainder of the year is encouraging. Our order rate momentum and healthy underlying demand conditions support the outlook for volume and margin improvement as we progress through the year. We are narrowing our full year adjusted EPS guidance towards the higher end of the range, and we'll continue to evaluate our full year targets as the year progresses especially if demand trends continue. \n Let's go to Slide 4. All-in revenue was up 1% in the quarter. Bookings were up 3% organically year-over-year and up 12% sequentially in the quarter, reflecting growing order rate momentum across much of the portfolio. Of note, after 7 quarters of bookings decline, as a result of the post-COVID backlogs, we have now seen positive bookings growth in 2 straight quarters and expect this positive trend to continue for the rest of the year. \n Segment margins were 19.7%, down 30 basis points. We expect to return to positive year-over-year accretion from here on mix and volume leverage. Adjusted EPS was up to $1.95 per share in the quarter, and we are guiding 1% to 3% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $9 to $9.15 for the year 2024. \n So let's move on to Slide 5. Engineered Products had a robust quarter, particularly strong volume growth and conversion waste handling, which set an all-time record for first quarter profits and should continue its positive trajectory on strong truck body order momentum and software adoption. Aerospace and defense also posted double-digit revenue growth. Volumes improved in vehicle aftermarket on better end market conditions and bookings growth, including in Europe. We expect volumes to remain strong for the segment throughout 2024. Margin performance was solid in the quarter on strong volume conversion, price/cost dynamics and productivity investments. Clean Energy and fueling returned to positive organic growth in the quarter after 9 consecutive quarters of flat to negative top line performance driven by the end of the EMV cycle in North America and channel destocking of what is most -- our most heavy distribution exposed segment. Margins were down in the quarter on negative comparable mix, but we expect to see sequential improvement from here and target full year margins up over [ '23 ] driven by attractive volume conversion and the benefits from previously enacted cost control measures. Imaging & Identification posted a steady quarter with lower printer shipments in Europe and the U.S., largely offset by strong volumes in consumables and aftermarket. We expect top line to return to growth next quarter and to be up for the year. Margin performance was exemplary on cost controls and higher mix of consumables and aftermarket shipments. Pumps & Process was up organically in the quarter on robust volumes in polymer processing and precision components. Order rates for thermal connectors were very encouraging. We are pleased to see biopharma shipments grow year-over-year with orders gained further momentum with a book-to-bill of 1.08 as customer inventories continue to normalize and commercial drug production and new therapy development remain robust. \n I would like to point out that our biopharma business is nearly all consumable and in the post pandemic destocking headwinds dissipate, this is mostly driven by biopharma production volumes, which are growing. Margins in the segment were down modestly due to strong volumes in polymer processing, which was slightly dilutive to the consolidated segment margin. If order trends hold, we expect margins maybe positive sequentially from here. Top line performance in Climate & Sustainability Technologies was down as expected, driven by the expected capital investment slowdown in beverage can making and the impact of destocking of stocking headwinds in the broader HVAC complex, most notably in European residential heat pumps on our brazed plate heat exchanger business. \n In contrast, our U.S. heat exchanger business continues to grow in double digits on technology share gains in an evolving end market applications, including data centers. We expect top line to improve as the year progresses with easier comparable performance in the second half of the year and supported by strong volume in CO2 refrigeration systems, which drove the bookings growth for the segment on several key customer build-out wins. \n I'll pass it on to Brad. \nBrad Cerepak: Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 7. Top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 1%. Acquisitions contributed 2% to the top line, while FX was essentially flat. The DE-STA-CO sale, which closed on March 31, will be an offset to acquisition revenue growth beginning in Q2. Total deal costs in the quarter were $3 million or $0.02 of EPS relating to the sale of DE-STA-CO and ongoing deal activity. From a geo perspective, the U.S., our largest market was up 1% in the quarter, while Europe and all of Asia were down 1% and 5%, respectively. China, which represents about half our revenue base in Asia, was up 5% organically in the quarter, with improving conditions across several end markets. \n On the bottom chart, bookings were up year-over-year and sequentially on strong order momentum as a result of largely normalized channel inventories and lead times. \n Our cash flow statement is on Slide 8. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $122 million or 6% of revenue. Q1 comparable performance was impacted by investments in working capital due to the timing of shipments, driving higher receivable balances as well investment in inventory ahead of seasonally stronger quarters in Q2 and Q3. The first quarter is traditionally our lowest cash flow quarter of the year. The change in accrued taxes was driven principally by the recording of future tax payments related to the DE-STA-CO divestiture. We plan to adjust these tax payments out of free cash flow reporting as they are nonoperating in nature in line with the exclusion of the gain on the sale of our adjusted P&L results. Our forecast for 2024 free cash flow remains on track between 13% and 15% of revenue. \n I'll turn it back to Rich. \nRichard Tobin: Okay. Before we go to Q&A, I wanted to provide a little bit more color on some of the product lines that helped deliver our results in the last quarter and positioned us to continue growing in the high secular growth rate markets. Early on, we saw a significant growth opportunity in each of these markets and proactively invested in CapEx and R&D to cultivate technological leadership and provide a sufficient foundation to win and scale with our customers. \n Across these markets, we enjoy leadership positions with strong brand recognition and well-entrenched intellectual property protection. Each of these end markets have enjoyed double-digit growth trajectories over the past 5 years and the robust booking trends in the first quarter point to these markets remaining meaningful contributor to Dover's overall revenue growth profile. In total, these products deliver attractive margin conversion that is accretive to Dover's consolidated margin. \n In CO2 systems, we were the early mover in transplanting natural refrigerant technology from Europe to the U.S., where we currently enjoy a technological lead and have the largest installed base in food retail applications and the broadest product offering. We have proactively expanded our capacity and invested heavily behind a platform-based product strategy supported by a differentiated digital go-to-market architecture that facilitates the sale and design process, reduces complexity improves product quality and delivers best-in-class lead times and reduces the cost for ourselves and our customers. \n Our recently launched platforms are gaining traction in the marketplace with several exciting large-scale CO2 conversion programs underway at key retailers with a multiyear runway. We are also benefiting from our exposure to data centers and the secular growth in infrastructure investment with the significant power requirements of next-generation chips that support artificial intelligence. Adoption are now requiring liquid cooling methods. We are exposed to liquid cooling of data centers in both our heat exchanger business, which enables heat transfer within the cooling distribution units and in the connector business, which provides leak free liquid connection points at the server racks and manifolds and now directly to the individual chip cooling cold plates. \n I'll leave the data center infrastructure and market forecast to our end customers further down the chain. For us, it's clearly an area of robust growth in the foreseeable future as evidenced by our recent order trajectory and high-profile specification wins with the chip OEMs. Importantly, we have proactively installed production capacity and are well positioned to meet any meaningful inflections in demand with industry best lead times. The through-cycle performance of our biopharma components platform has been solid despite the well-chronicled post-COVID destocking headwinds over the past 2 years. With customer inventory levels now normalizing, the long-term tailwinds for single-use bioprocessing and cell and gene therapies are compelling and importantly, our products are specified for a regulated manufacturing environment. \n While our business is still below peak levels, we believe the recent booking trends and positive tone from our customers and industry partners set up for a potential upside this year. \n Finally, let's go to Slide 10 shows the long-term performance of our portfolio. Our playbook for earnings accretion remains unchanged to deliver growth through a combination of top line organic growth earnings accretion through operational execution and returns of productive capital deployment strategy. We are pleased with the start of the year with our flexible business model, we will continue to monitor any end market conditions and can quickly respond to changes in the marketplace. \n And Jack, let's go to Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n We will now hear from Mike Halloran with Baird. \nMichael Halloran: Okay. So a couple of questions here. First on orders. Obviously, comps are easy in the next couple of quarters, but maybe just talk a little bit about the underlying perspective from an end market that gets you comfortable with the order commentary for the year, just kind of the confidence in the composition of where that order growth is going to come from, from an underlying market perspective. And then related, do you see orders up sequentially going into the second quarter? \nRichard Tobin: Yes, I do. Look, we'd have to go segment by segment because they're different between the short cycle and the longer cycle portions of the portfolio, but orders are up broad-based with the exception of the 2 that we highlighted, both in can making and in heat exchangers in Europe. We would expect that trend to continue, which supports, basically, the seasonality where we expect some pretty big step-up in performance in Q2 and Q3, and we'll see about Q4, which will be a dynamic of how the order rates go between now and then. I think most importantly, our confidence is based on the fact that of all the hard work we did in terms of managing inventory through the channel last year, and that's allowed to us to have more confidence in terms of the order rates going forward. \nMichael Halloran: Can you just talk to the action-ability of the M&A pipeline from your perspective? Obviously, the commentary has been pretty positive about your flexibility in the short term here. How would you look at that channel as we're sitting here today in the priorities? \nRichard Tobin: It's loosened for sure. I think there's a recognition now that interest rates are here to stay, that's helpful. I think that the equity markets have rallied quite a bit. So I think that this fear of purchase compression on multiples has gone away. But it's not flood yet, but I think that the activity in terms of opportunities that we can look at is a lot better than it would have been a year ago today. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: So just on the orders comment, I guess, you said SWEP really isn't picking up. Is that a bit of a reflection of kind of the EU heat pump market that that's not really you would expect to see it by now, if you were -- if things were turning up there in the second half. I think you've said that before? \nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean we're running out of time here. So our expectation that, that market will be clearly down year-over-year. I think that we've got -- we've brought down even our internal estimates for this year. So I think that's probably the one business that is not tracking to what we thought it would have been. Maybe we're a little optimistic, but we'll see. So we would have to see orders bounce back at the end of Q2 to support any kind of inflection in the marketplace in the second half. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Right. So like a solid double digit first half to second half, like the way you see orders today, that doesn't sound right. \nRichard Tobin: Yes. I mean, I have to go back and look at the comps. But if you remember last year... \nC. Stephen Tusa: I meant sequential, sequential, sequential. \nRichard Tobin: Yes. Yes, sequential, yes. \nC. Stephen Tusa: You don't see that as being -- that's not embedded in your current forecast now given you aren't seeing the orders, just making sure. \nRichard Tobin: That's correct. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then just could you help calibrate us just on an EPS basis for the second quarter? Or however you want to talk about it? I mean it looks like the orders are running right now ahead of the sales forecast that are out there, your orders are going to be up sequentially. So I mean like you look like you're covered from an orders perspective. Any further color on the seasonality of EPS for 2Q? Anything that influences margins in a major way or anything like that because the sales look like they're going to be okay relative to consensus? \nRichard Tobin: Yes, I don't think that there's any change. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. So what is it usually sequentially or percentage of the year, maybe Brad? \nBrad Cerepak: I think the normal season [indiscernible]. \nC. Stephen Tusa: I knew you wouldn't want to answer this. So I'll go to Brad. \nRichard Tobin: Brad left the room, Steve. Sorry I mean, look I think the seasonality that we would expect is where we're tracking right now. So Q2, Q3 up and then we leave some optionality in Q4, and that will, back to your question about order rates, Q4 will be depending on how we track. So there is potential upside in Q4 if order rates continue to build. \nBrad Cerepak: Yes. There's a nuance on order rates because DE-STA-CO now out of our order book and Jack can take you through that, but we still see sequential up even covering DE-STA-CO in the second quarter and through the year. \nC. Stephen Tusa: So like 225-ish for 2Q, does that sound about right? \nBrad Cerepak: You know we don't give quarterly guidance. \nRichard Tobin: All right. Any other questions? \nC. Stephen Tusa: No, no, that's it. I guess I'll ask Jack offline. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. \nJulian Mitchell: Maybe I just wanted to start off with the DCST segment. So I think price down a little bit year-on-year. Was that just kind of a mixed thing and then it comes back later in the year. And on the margin front for DCST, 14% first quarter, do we just assume a sort of steady sequential ramp from that point through the year? \nRichard Tobin: I think it's because of the effect -- the negative effect on the heat exchanger business, which is accretive to that segment. The ramp is going to be very much predicated upon how much CO2 system volume we can get out between now and the end of the year. So I guess, to answer your question, is it will ramp, but you need to take into account when you're looking at comps that until we get into the back half of next year, we're going to be pushing up against the reduced volume and heat exchangers. \nJulian Mitchell: Got it. And on the pricing, I think it was down just a little bit in Q1. And is there sort of anything to call out there? Does it flip back to positive later in the year? \nRichard Tobin: Yes, I think that's a nice, to be honest with you. I mean, the pricing that we have out there is relatively hold. It's got to be more mix related than anything else. \nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, sort of more broadly, when you're looking at your customers and then realize there's a breadth of end market exposures. But is it your perspective that for your product that channel partners and your customers, the sort of inventories are pretty lean now for where we are in the year, any concerns around further need for inventory reduction? Or do you think we start to move the other way when you're looking at how your channel partners are behaving based on orders and so forth? \nRichard Tobin: Yes. The portions of the business that are distribution, we don't see a build. We just see pass-through right now. So one would hope that we get a little bit of build, but that will be dependent on what we see on pull-through demand from here. So we've talked about this quite a bit, Julian. I mean we did a lot of work and took proactive work in the second half of the year. \n Our distribution channel checks don't show build, we just see pass-through right now. So it's not going to be a headwind. Hopefully, if demand continues to inflect positively, there will be a little bit of a tailwind. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. \nBrett Linzey: I wanted to come back to biopharma. You noted some potential upside moving through the year. It does sound like customer tone has improved there. Maybe you could just talk about some of the warranty expirations and some of the obsolescence of some of that single-use channel inventory that could be a multiplier effect for that business. \nRichard Tobin: It's all done now, right? If you went back and look sequentially at the biopharma business where shipments are heavy, that where we've lapped kind of that 2.5-, 3-year time line now. So there's still pockets of inventory out there and the system builds are relatively a headwind right now, but on kind of the processing side of the business is what is inflecting forward. So we expect orders to be up from here just because of the fact that the inventory has been cleared one way or another over the last 36 months. \nBrett Linzey: And then maybe shifting over to thermal connectors, doubling of bookings. What do you think the revenue run rate is in that business by year-end? And I guess, is there any reason why this business and those applications should be growing in line with some of the liquid cooling adoption trends? \nRichard Tobin: That's what we hope. I think it's -- I'm not going to size it for you right now because of the competitive aspect of the end market. What I can tell you is we feel good about where we are positioned from a spec point of view. I think that we're going to be a little bit of a trailer because we're a subcomponent behind a lot of the build that's going out right now. But what I can also tell you is we have prebuilt the production capacity that if it was to inflect kind of like what we saw in biopharma, we're going to be able to be there with industry-leading lead times. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. \nJoseph Ritchie: And so maybe sticking on that Slide 9, I did actually get a chance to see some of your thermal connectors. Your customers were showing them off the data center world a couple of weeks ago. But my question is really on the CO2 systems. Like Rich, how far long do you think we are in terms of these regulatory tailwinds that's helping this business? And maybe just kind of maybe talk a little bit about what the path from here? \nRichard Tobin: Okay. We are shipping our first platform. We're going to be launching our second platform in the next couple of months. And then sequentially, after that, the third platform will be launched after that. What we have right now is early adopters. So there are certain retail clients that because of ESG reasons and a variety of other reasons, have chosen to be an early adopter in the space and not wait for the regulatory aspect of it. And then we've got a lot of customers that are buying individual units to test them out. So I think we're in the early innings here, but we like the trajectory. \nJoseph Ritchie: Okay. Cool. No, that's great to hear. And then -- and I know, look, you guys have referenced this biopharma, it seems like we're starting to see some green shoots here. I'm just curious, as you're kind of thinking through the margin trajectory for that business going forward? Maybe just kind of help us with the path from here? \nRichard Tobin: It's mix, Joe. So as the revenue climbs, the margin mix is important to the segment. And a way to look at it, frankly, is to go look back a couple of years at the margin that we were at and what we actually didn't decline that much in consolidation because the balance of the segment portfolio actually performed quite well. So I wouldn't think about it in terms of incremental leverage on a unit basis. I would look at it more as the revenue climbs, the segment mixes up from there. \nJoseph Ritchie: Yes. And maybe just a quick follow-up there. So are we at a bottom then in margins for that business you expect it to improve from here sequentially if any... \nRichard Tobin: We never really gave up any margin in the business. What we gave up was volume. So like I said, it's not a business that you would look at decremental and incremental margins. It's just mix up, mix down as a proportion of revenue. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Maybe just thinking about the segment level organic growth versus your own expectations. It seems relatively clear that DEP should continue to be Dover's best growth in '24 and DCST is the weakest. But if you look at the other segments, how are you thinking about growth versus that 1% to 3% guide for the company? And were there any surprises versus your own expectations in Q1? \nRichard Tobin: Okay. Let me think about it. I think that, as I mentioned earlier, the only business that is performing worse than what was baked into our original forecast is the heat exchanger business in Europe for heat pumps, which is about -- on a last year basis, it is about 30% of our revenue. So we're going to have to mop up some of that. Now what we have offsetting that is CO2, right? And so I just answered Joe's questions about the trajectory in the market and to the extent that the demand continues to be solid, we should be able to mop up some of that decline. And Belvac was always baked into our forecast. So we don't think that we will post top line growth in that particular segment until Belvac just basically bottoms from there. And then we'd expect to inflect positively, hopefully, in Q4, depending on CO2 demand. The balance of the businesses are tracking by and large, exactly where we had forecasted. So they're really going into the quarter because I think I mentioned that when we did the full year results, it was all about order momentum and so far, so good. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then, Rich, maybe just on DCEF. Can you give us a little more color into the comment you made about margin up for the year after that Q1 start. I know you do have that cost out programs, so how does that flow in through the year and help you get to where you want to be? \nRichard Tobin: Look, I mean, I think from a margin heavy lifting point of view, I think that's where we've got to do the most work. I think the management team is on it. So you've seen us take some structural cost out of that business. What you need to understand is that business is from a proportion point of view, the one that's most exposed to distribution, right? \n So it's had a pretty good headwind during the, let's call it, the destocking phase of 2023. So it should run that was a business that we can look to that says, okay, incremental margin should be positive as volume flexes upward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. A little bit of a bigger picture question here. So you're seeing broad-based orders improvement, manufacturing PMI back above 50. If you had to take a cut at looking back, right, was there actual underlying demand weakness last year? Or was it all just destocking and a function of comps i.e., do you think the underlying trend is getting -- demand trend is getting better now? \nRichard Tobin: The demand trend is getting better now because of the headwind from destocking in the previous comps. And then after that, then you get to idiosyncratic product lines and business and geographies, but if you want a macro comment, right? And I think that we addressed it last year is even if you look back 2 years, unitary demand was relatively flat, right? There was a lot of pricing flowing through the marketplace, but the unitary demand was relatively flat. And then because of interest rates, you had a negative headwind last year in terms of destocking. So going into this year, you're thinking positively, let's say, that we'll see about unitary demand year-over-year, whether it inflects up, but what we know categorically is that you don't have the headwind from destocking them, right, because it's just pass-through. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: And then just a quick housekeeping question. What is the share count and effective tax rate assumption embedded in the 2024 EPS guide? \nRichard Tobin: You can call Jack about that. Let's not get into -- I'm not going to page through all these stock units. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. \nJeffrey Sprague: Rich, you would -- you addressed kind of your view on what's going on in distribution. Do you have kind of a view on what's going on with the OEM customers? Like if we think about Europe heat pumps, do you know one way or the other, if they actually are sitting on inventory or your product or you're just really kind of waiting for the order for kind of a view of what the underlying demand might be. So heat pumps is the one that kind of stands out, but maybe there's some others where that's kind of a question also. \nRichard Tobin: They're clearly sitting on our product in inventory. So you've got kind of like you've got the market going down and then you've got inventory with -- because we're a subcomponent with our partners. So we're going to go down first, I guess, is what I'm saying. We went up first as when pull-through demand goes up and everybody kind of puts inventory to allow for their estimates on the builds and now you've got the market turning lower and so that inventory that's out there has got to get depleted. So our expectation is that our demand will inflect up before the end market demand kind of bottoms. \nJeffrey Sprague: Yes. That makes sense. And then on the liquid cooling stuff, there's a number of competitors and the like, and I don't expect you to name names, but do you have more than 1 or 2 cooling-related customers in this market? And you had also indicated you were specified by the chip OEMs, not to parse words, but I'm just wondering if that was kind of a misspeaking and you're actually specified by the cooling HVAC-related companies. Just curious on that detail. \nRichard Tobin: I'm not -- it wasn't a misspeaking, but it depends on the chip and it depends on the customer in terms of how without getting into the details about it, you do need to get specified by the chip maker who makes recommendations to the builder, right? So we did the hard work in getting specified at the up end. But clearly, we're going to have to sell into the build channel ultimately will be our customers as those units are built. \nJeffrey Sprague: And it's more than more customers than I can count on one hand or now if you are talking... \nRichard Tobin: Apparently, everybody is in the space, including us. What I can tell you is it's a unique product, number one; and number two, that the production requirements look very much like pharma and that is good for us because we're basically building these products in not the same facility. We've got a dedicated facility for these products, but we're going to run it more or less the way we run our connector business for biopharma. So I think we're in good shape from an IP point of view, and we're in good shape in terms of production capacity. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. \nScott Davis: Guys, you were probably a little bit more skeptical than some of the others in '24 on kind of price and ability to get more price, can we mark-to-market that a little bit here in April? Have you been able to be a little bit more successful with price than perhaps you may have thought? \nRichard Tobin: I think that we're not going to be negative on price, for sure. I would expect us to be positive to price by the end of the year. I just think that the during supply chain issues and everything else, there was a little bit of solid days in price passing going on. And we weren't the big winners there to be perfectly frank. If you go back and look at our price realization through that period, arguably, we should have taken more. \n But at the end of the day, to me, that's more of a non headwind going forward because all that capacity got built out if market demand is good, but it's not exactly robust. I don't think there were -- I think that we're positioned appropriately that we're not going to have to give back price because there's been a lot of price take over the last 36 months. \nScott Davis: Makes sense. And Rich, totally switching gears, but are you happy with the portfolio you have? It's just -- it's very broad. So there's got to be good and bad. But the opposite of an expensive M&A market is the opportunity to sell things perhaps at above market value. So is there parts of the portfolio that you think makes sense to look at departing with. \nRichard Tobin: How do I want to answer that? I know that I'm on the clock, right? Could you give me 12 months. DE-STA-CO is a good example, right? That's a business that we looked at in terms of end market exposure and where we had taken it to from a margin point of view, we found a partner, we monetized it, I think, at a multiple that DE-STA-CO not trading within the Dover portfolio, so I think that, that optionality remains on other pieces of the portfolio, but you need to find ruling partners and the like, this is the first part of the question. \n The second part of the question, Scott, is if we go back to '18, '19 that we said that we were not just going to go around selling stuff around here to dress up margin expansion. That's easy to do at the end of the day, but I don't think it's creating shareholder value. It's just creating optics. We've moved up the margin here substantially right? So I think that unlike '18 and '19, if we were to monetize pieces of the portfolio, we're going to get a lot more than we would have getting back then to the extent that we can find a willing partner there. So I understand that the complexity of the portfolio is a difficult issue from a thematic point of view, but I'm not going to apologize for the value creation of -- that we've been able to extract from the portfolio. So we'll just retain that optionality going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph O'Dea: Rich, I wanted to ask about the climate orders in the quarter, pretty notable step up and well above each quarter of 2023, so just trying to understand a little bit more what happened in Q1 versus every quarter of 2023 that brought sort of customers forward. It sounds like what you saw in terms of order levels in Q1 is more of a sustainable level moving forward. So just kind of the catalyst behind that switch from a calendar flip and much stronger demand. \nRichard Tobin: Well, when you take into account that our orders are dropping in heat exchangers and down -- maybe not down in Belvac because Belvac built that backlog several years ago, but down in heat exchangers, the order rate is exclusively in the fact that we're launching a new product line in CO2 systems. So that's what's different. \nJoseph O'Dea: But you wouldn't call that lumpy. You're not saying Q1 is like lumpy. It's like there's sustainable demand at that level in Climate. \nRichard Tobin: Look, I mean they're going to continue well, CO2 is going to continue to offset the heat exchanger business. Now the heat exchanger business has easier comps once we get beyond August because I think that inflected down in September of last year. So it may be a little bit of put and take between now and then because in CO2 systems, we tend to get large orders every once in a while to flex it up and down. But over time, I think that order rates should look good from the half year going forward, for sure. \nJoseph O'Dea: Got it. And then just circling back to David's question, making sure I kind of understand the takeaway. I mean, it sounds like what you're seeing in order levels is really the reflection of what you see for sell-through demand so that this is sort of working through the end of destock and this is just reflective of sell-through demand. It's not saying that sequentially from, say, 3Q to 4Q to 1Q, the demand environment has really gotten better. It's really just -- this is the absence of the pressure that we saw on channel reductions. \nRichard Tobin: Right. That's it, right? Because if we go back last year and the decline in revenue that wasn't a reflection of pull-through demand because it had the headwind of destocking. Now what you have is just basically, let's just call it pass-through. So we don't see stocking. We just see it pass it. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray: Can we get on imaging, just the, say, the world in consumer packaged goods, it sounded like that business is beginning to also see some normal demand, but what have you guys has been seeing? \nRichard Tobin: It's stable, Deane. You have some inflection up and down between the equipment side that the consumable portion is generally a steady eddy. It doesn't flex up or down. You have a little bit of price that goes through every year. I wouldn't be too concerned on quarter-to-quarter movements because they don't tend to be very high at the end of the day, and there's a lot of FX rolling through there just because of the fact that it is truly I think the only real true global business that we have. So it's steady, right? We don't see an inflection up in terms of production rates and consumer products. China seems to be, which was a headwind next year, seems to sequentially be improving. So we'll see from there, but it does run up against a strengthening dollar. \nDeane Dray: Understood. And then just a couple of cleanup questions on the data center discussions on this call. The first is, I know you've got lots of headaches with SWEP heat exchangers, what about SWEP in data centers in Europe? I know you were highlighting in the U.S., but where's SWEP and data centers in Europe? And then on the connectors are you being asked to bid on these projects for the chip makers? Or are you being is a negotiated design in because that's a big differentiator. \nRichard Tobin: Let me take the last question first, it's design in. I'm sure that our commercial teams will say it's not that easy. But the fact of the matter is it's designed in predominantly. Now there will be a variety of different negotiations with the participants that are building out the infrastructure, but the most important part, it's kind of win the spec business early on and then we see where we go from there. Data centers in Europe, I'm going to have to get back to you. I don't think it's meaningful. I think that the data center activity that we see is more North American-based. \nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brad Cerepak",
            "content": "Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 7. Top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 1%. Acquisitions contributed 2% to the top line, while FX was essentially flat. The DE-STA-CO sale, which closed on March 31, will be an offset to acquisition revenue growth beginning in Q2. Total deal costs in the quarter were $3 million or $0.02 of EPS relating to the sale of DE-STA-CO and ongoing deal activity. From a geo perspective, the U.S., our largest market was up 1% in the quarter, while Europe and all of Asia were down 1% and 5%, respectively. China, which represents about half our revenue base in Asia, was up 5% organically in the quarter, with improving conditions across several end markets. \n On the bottom chart, bookings were up year-over-year and sequentially on strong order momentum as a result of largely normalized channel inventories and lead times. \n Our cash flow statement is on Slide 8. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $122 million or 6% of revenue. Q1 comparable performance was impacted by investments in working capital due to the timing of shipments, driving higher receivable balances as well investment in inventory ahead of seasonally stronger quarters in Q2 and Q3. The first quarter is traditionally our lowest cash flow quarter of the year. The change in accrued taxes was driven principally by the recording of future tax payments related to the DE-STA-CO divestiture. We plan to adjust these tax payments out of free cash flow reporting as they are nonoperating in nature in line with the exclusion of the gain on the sale of our adjusted P&L results. Our forecast for 2024 free cash flow remains on track between 13% and 15% of revenue. \n I'll turn it back to Rich. I think the normal season [indiscernible]. Yes. There's a nuance on order rates because DE-STA-CO now out of our order book and Jack can take you through that, but we still see sequential up even covering DE-STA-CO in the second quarter and through the year. You know we don't give quarterly guidance."

            "name": "Richard Tobin",
            "content": "Thanks, Jack. \n Let's go to Slide 3. First quarter results were in line with our expectations. Strong performance across several of our end markets together with improving order and shipment trends in biopharma components and growth platforms, we're able to offset the counter cyclicality some of our long-cycle portfolio in what was expected to be our toughest comparable quarter this year. It is clear that our operating posture that we took in the second half of 2023 to proactively curtail production has had its intended effect. \n Customer and channel inventories are now largely in balance with prevailing demand conditions and level set to normalize lead times. As a result, order momentum in the quarter was strong and broad-based, particularly in our shorter-cycle end markets, building off an exit rate from last year and bolstering our confidence full year outlook. We remain active on capital deployment. \n During the quarter, we closed 2 synergistic bolt-on acquisitions that add attractive digital and reoccurring revenue streams to our retail fueling and carwash platforms. The DE-STA-CO of divestiture closed at the end of March as part of our ongoing portfolio evolution. We also launched a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program at the end of February to return excess capital to our shareholders. Our strong cash flow generation along with the proceeds of the DE-STA-CO sale provide ample capacity for further capital deployment in 2024. \n We're off to a solid start to the year and the setup for the remainder of the year is encouraging. Our order rate momentum and healthy underlying demand conditions support the outlook for volume and margin improvement as we progress through the year. We are narrowing our full year adjusted EPS guidance towards the higher end of the range, and we'll continue to evaluate our full year targets as the year progresses especially if demand trends continue. \n Let's go to Slide 4. All-in revenue was up 1% in the quarter. Bookings were up 3% organically year-over-year and up 12% sequentially in the quarter, reflecting growing order rate momentum across much of the portfolio. Of note, after 7 quarters of bookings decline, as a result of the post-COVID backlogs, we have now seen positive bookings growth in 2 straight quarters and expect this positive trend to continue for the rest of the year. \n Segment margins were 19.7%, down 30 basis points. We expect to return to positive year-over-year accretion from here on mix and volume leverage. Adjusted EPS was up to $1.95 per share in the quarter, and we are guiding 1% to 3% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $9 to $9.15 for the year 2024. \n So let's move on to Slide 5. Engineered Products had a robust quarter, particularly strong volume growth and conversion waste handling, which set an all-time record for first quarter profits and should continue its positive trajectory on strong truck body order momentum and software adoption. Aerospace and defense also posted double-digit revenue growth. Volumes improved in vehicle aftermarket on better end market conditions and bookings growth, including in Europe. We expect volumes to remain strong for the segment throughout 2024. Margin performance was solid in the quarter on strong volume conversion, price/cost dynamics and productivity investments. Clean Energy and fueling returned to positive organic growth in the quarter after 9 consecutive quarters of flat to negative top line performance driven by the end of the EMV cycle in North America and channel destocking of what is most -- our most heavy distribution exposed segment. Margins were down in the quarter on negative comparable mix, but we expect to see sequential improvement from here and target full year margins up over [ '23 ] driven by attractive volume conversion and the benefits from previously enacted cost control measures. Imaging & Identification posted a steady quarter with lower printer shipments in Europe and the U.S., largely offset by strong volumes in consumables and aftermarket. We expect top line to return to growth next quarter and to be up for the year. Margin performance was exemplary on cost controls and higher mix of consumables and aftermarket shipments. Pumps & Process was up organically in the quarter on robust volumes in polymer processing and precision components. Order rates for thermal connectors were very encouraging. We are pleased to see biopharma shipments grow year-over-year with orders gained further momentum with a book-to-bill of 1.08 as customer inventories continue to normalize and commercial drug production and new therapy development remain robust. \n I would like to point out that our biopharma business is nearly all consumable and in the post pandemic destocking headwinds dissipate, this is mostly driven by biopharma production volumes, which are growing. Margins in the segment were down modestly due to strong volumes in polymer processing, which was slightly dilutive to the consolidated segment margin. If order trends hold, we expect margins maybe positive sequentially from here. Top line performance in Climate & Sustainability Technologies was down as expected, driven by the expected capital investment slowdown in beverage can making and the impact of destocking of stocking headwinds in the broader HVAC complex, most notably in European residential heat pumps on our brazed plate heat exchanger business. \n In contrast, our U.S. heat exchanger business continues to grow in double digits on technology share gains in an evolving end market applications, including data centers. We expect top line to improve as the year progresses with easier comparable performance in the second half of the year and supported by strong volume in CO2 refrigeration systems, which drove the bookings growth for the segment on several key customer build-out wins. \n I'll pass it on to Brad. Okay. Before we go to Q&A, I wanted to provide a little bit more color on some of the product lines that helped deliver our results in the last quarter and positioned us to continue growing in the high secular growth rate markets. Early on, we saw a significant growth opportunity in each of these markets and proactively invested in CapEx and R&D to cultivate technological leadership and provide a sufficient foundation to win and scale with our customers. \n Across these markets, we enjoy leadership positions with strong brand recognition and well-entrenched intellectual property protection. Each of these end markets have enjoyed double-digit growth trajectories over the past 5 years and the robust booking trends in the first quarter point to these markets remaining meaningful contributor to Dover's overall revenue growth profile. In total, these products deliver attractive margin conversion that is accretive to Dover's consolidated margin. \n In CO2 systems, we were the early mover in transplanting natural refrigerant technology from Europe to the U.S., where we currently enjoy a technological lead and have the largest installed base in food retail applications and the broadest product offering. We have proactively expanded our capacity and invested heavily behind a platform-based product strategy supported by a differentiated digital go-to-market architecture that facilitates the sale and design process, reduces complexity improves product quality and delivers best-in-class lead times and reduces the cost for ourselves and our customers. \n Our recently launched platforms are gaining traction in the marketplace with several exciting large-scale CO2 conversion programs underway at key retailers with a multiyear runway. We are also benefiting from our exposure to data centers and the secular growth in infrastructure investment with the significant power requirements of next-generation chips that support artificial intelligence. Adoption are now requiring liquid cooling methods. We are exposed to liquid cooling of data centers in both our heat exchanger business, which enables heat transfer within the cooling distribution units and in the connector business, which provides leak free liquid connection points at the server racks and manifolds and now directly to the individual chip cooling cold plates. \n I'll leave the data center infrastructure and market forecast to our end customers further down the chain. For us, it's clearly an area of robust growth in the foreseeable future as evidenced by our recent order trajectory and high-profile specification wins with the chip OEMs. Importantly, we have proactively installed production capacity and are well positioned to meet any meaningful inflections in demand with industry best lead times. The through-cycle performance of our biopharma components platform has been solid despite the well-chronicled post-COVID destocking headwinds over the past 2 years. With customer inventory levels now normalizing, the long-term tailwinds for single-use bioprocessing and cell and gene therapies are compelling and importantly, our products are specified for a regulated manufacturing environment. \n While our business is still below peak levels, we believe the recent booking trends and positive tone from our customers and industry partners set up for a potential upside this year. \n Finally, let's go to Slide 10 shows the long-term performance of our portfolio. Our playbook for earnings accretion remains unchanged to deliver growth through a combination of top line organic growth earnings accretion through operational execution and returns of productive capital deployment strategy. We are pleased with the start of the year with our flexible business model, we will continue to monitor any end market conditions and can quickly respond to changes in the marketplace. \n And Jack, let's go to Q&A. Yes, I do. Look, we'd have to go segment by segment because they're different between the short cycle and the longer cycle portions of the portfolio, but orders are up broad-based with the exception of the 2 that we highlighted, both in can making and in heat exchangers in Europe. We would expect that trend to continue, which supports, basically, the seasonality where we expect some pretty big step-up in performance in Q2 and Q3, and we'll see about Q4, which will be a dynamic of how the order rates go between now and then. I think most importantly, our confidence is based on the fact that of all the hard work we did in terms of managing inventory through the channel last year, and that's allowed to us to have more confidence in terms of the order rates going forward. It's loosened for sure. I think there's a recognition now that interest rates are here to stay, that's helpful. I think that the equity markets have rallied quite a bit. So I think that this fear of purchase compression on multiples has gone away. But it's not flood yet, but I think that the activity in terms of opportunities that we can look at is a lot better than it would have been a year ago today. Yes. I mean we're running out of time here. So our expectation that, that market will be clearly down year-over-year. I think that we've got -- we've brought down even our internal estimates for this year. So I think that's probably the one business that is not tracking to what we thought it would have been. Maybe we're a little optimistic, but we'll see. So we would have to see orders bounce back at the end of Q2 to support any kind of inflection in the marketplace in the second half. Yes. I mean, I have to go back and look at the comps. But if you remember last year... Yes. Yes, sequential, yes. That's correct. Yes, I don't think that there's any change. Brad left the room, Steve. Sorry I mean, look I think the seasonality that we would expect is where we're tracking right now. So Q2, Q3 up and then we leave some optionality in Q4, and that will, back to your question about order rates, Q4 will be depending on how we track. So there is potential upside in Q4 if order rates continue to build. All right. Any other questions? I think it's because of the effect -- the negative effect on the heat exchanger business, which is accretive to that segment. The ramp is going to be very much predicated upon how much CO2 system volume we can get out between now and the end of the year. So I guess, to answer your question, is it will ramp, but you need to take into account when you're looking at comps that until we get into the back half of next year, we're going to be pushing up against the reduced volume and heat exchangers. Yes, I think that's a nice, to be honest with you. I mean, the pricing that we have out there is relatively hold. It's got to be more mix related than anything else. Yes. The portions of the business that are distribution, we don't see a build. We just see pass-through right now. So one would hope that we get a little bit of build, but that will be dependent on what we see on pull-through demand from here. So we've talked about this quite a bit, Julian. I mean we did a lot of work and took proactive work in the second half of the year. \n Our distribution channel checks don't show build, we just see pass-through right now. So it's not going to be a headwind. Hopefully, if demand continues to inflect positively, there will be a little bit of a tailwind. It's all done now, right? If you went back and look sequentially at the biopharma business where shipments are heavy, that where we've lapped kind of that 2.5-, 3-year time line now. So there's still pockets of inventory out there and the system builds are relatively a headwind right now, but on kind of the processing side of the business is what is inflecting forward. So we expect orders to be up from here just because of the fact that the inventory has been cleared one way or another over the last 36 months. That's what we hope. I think it's -- I'm not going to size it for you right now because of the competitive aspect of the end market. What I can tell you is we feel good about where we are positioned from a spec point of view. I think that we're going to be a little bit of a trailer because we're a subcomponent behind a lot of the build that's going out right now. But what I can also tell you is we have prebuilt the production capacity that if it was to inflect kind of like what we saw in biopharma, we're going to be able to be there with industry-leading lead times. Okay. We are shipping our first platform. We're going to be launching our second platform in the next couple of months. And then sequentially, after that, the third platform will be launched after that. What we have right now is early adopters. So there are certain retail clients that because of ESG reasons and a variety of other reasons, have chosen to be an early adopter in the space and not wait for the regulatory aspect of it. And then we've got a lot of customers that are buying individual units to test them out. So I think we're in the early innings here, but we like the trajectory. It's mix, Joe. So as the revenue climbs, the margin mix is important to the segment. And a way to look at it, frankly, is to go look back a couple of years at the margin that we were at and what we actually didn't decline that much in consolidation because the balance of the segment portfolio actually performed quite well. So I wouldn't think about it in terms of incremental leverage on a unit basis. I would look at it more as the revenue climbs, the segment mixes up from there. We never really gave up any margin in the business. What we gave up was volume. So like I said, it's not a business that you would look at decremental and incremental margins. It's just mix up, mix down as a proportion of revenue. Okay. Let me think about it. I think that, as I mentioned earlier, the only business that is performing worse than what was baked into our original forecast is the heat exchanger business in Europe for heat pumps, which is about -- on a last year basis, it is about 30% of our revenue. So we're going to have to mop up some of that. Now what we have offsetting that is CO2, right? And so I just answered Joe's questions about the trajectory in the market and to the extent that the demand continues to be solid, we should be able to mop up some of that decline. And Belvac was always baked into our forecast. So we don't think that we will post top line growth in that particular segment until Belvac just basically bottoms from there. And then we'd expect to inflect positively, hopefully, in Q4, depending on CO2 demand. The balance of the businesses are tracking by and large, exactly where we had forecasted. So they're really going into the quarter because I think I mentioned that when we did the full year results, it was all about order momentum and so far, so good. Look, I mean, I think from a margin heavy lifting point of view, I think that's where we've got to do the most work. I think the management team is on it. So you've seen us take some structural cost out of that business. What you need to understand is that business is from a proportion point of view, the one that's most exposed to distribution, right? \n So it's had a pretty good headwind during the, let's call it, the destocking phase of 2023. So it should run that was a business that we can look to that says, okay, incremental margin should be positive as volume flexes upward. The demand trend is getting better now because of the headwind from destocking in the previous comps. And then after that, then you get to idiosyncratic product lines and business and geographies, but if you want a macro comment, right? And I think that we addressed it last year is even if you look back 2 years, unitary demand was relatively flat, right? There was a lot of pricing flowing through the marketplace, but the unitary demand was relatively flat. And then because of interest rates, you had a negative headwind last year in terms of destocking. So going into this year, you're thinking positively, let's say, that we'll see about unitary demand year-over-year, whether it inflects up, but what we know categorically is that you don't have the headwind from destocking them, right, because it's just pass-through. You can call Jack about that. Let's not get into -- I'm not going to page through all these stock units. They're clearly sitting on our product in inventory. So you've got kind of like you've got the market going down and then you've got inventory with -- because we're a subcomponent with our partners. So we're going to go down first, I guess, is what I'm saying. We went up first as when pull-through demand goes up and everybody kind of puts inventory to allow for their estimates on the builds and now you've got the market turning lower and so that inventory that's out there has got to get depleted. So our expectation is that our demand will inflect up before the end market demand kind of bottoms. I'm not -- it wasn't a misspeaking, but it depends on the chip and it depends on the customer in terms of how without getting into the details about it, you do need to get specified by the chip maker who makes recommendations to the builder, right? So we did the hard work in getting specified at the up end. But clearly, we're going to have to sell into the build channel ultimately will be our customers as those units are built. Apparently, everybody is in the space, including us. What I can tell you is it's a unique product, number one; and number two, that the production requirements look very much like pharma and that is good for us because we're basically building these products in not the same facility. We've got a dedicated facility for these products, but we're going to run it more or less the way we run our connector business for biopharma. So I think we're in good shape from an IP point of view, and we're in good shape in terms of production capacity. I think that we're not going to be negative on price, for sure. I would expect us to be positive to price by the end of the year. I just think that the during supply chain issues and everything else, there was a little bit of solid days in price passing going on. And we weren't the big winners there to be perfectly frank. If you go back and look at our price realization through that period, arguably, we should have taken more. \n But at the end of the day, to me, that's more of a non headwind going forward because all that capacity got built out if market demand is good, but it's not exactly robust. I don't think there were -- I think that we're positioned appropriately that we're not going to have to give back price because there's been a lot of price take over the last 36 months. How do I want to answer that? I know that I'm on the clock, right? Could you give me 12 months. DE-STA-CO is a good example, right? That's a business that we looked at in terms of end market exposure and where we had taken it to from a margin point of view, we found a partner, we monetized it, I think, at a multiple that DE-STA-CO not trading within the Dover portfolio, so I think that, that optionality remains on other pieces of the portfolio, but you need to find ruling partners and the like, this is the first part of the question. \n The second part of the question, Scott, is if we go back to '18, '19 that we said that we were not just going to go around selling stuff around here to dress up margin expansion. That's easy to do at the end of the day, but I don't think it's creating shareholder value. It's just creating optics. We've moved up the margin here substantially right? So I think that unlike '18 and '19, if we were to monetize pieces of the portfolio, we're going to get a lot more than we would have getting back then to the extent that we can find a willing partner there. So I understand that the complexity of the portfolio is a difficult issue from a thematic point of view, but I'm not going to apologize for the value creation of -- that we've been able to extract from the portfolio. So we'll just retain that optionality going forward. Well, when you take into account that our orders are dropping in heat exchangers and down -- maybe not down in Belvac because Belvac built that backlog several years ago, but down in heat exchangers, the order rate is exclusively in the fact that we're launching a new product line in CO2 systems. So that's what's different. Look, I mean they're going to continue well, CO2 is going to continue to offset the heat exchanger business. Now the heat exchanger business has easier comps once we get beyond August because I think that inflected down in September of last year. So it may be a little bit of put and take between now and then because in CO2 systems, we tend to get large orders every once in a while to flex it up and down. But over time, I think that order rates should look good from the half year going forward, for sure. Right. That's it, right? Because if we go back last year and the decline in revenue that wasn't a reflection of pull-through demand because it had the headwind of destocking. Now what you have is just basically, let's just call it pass-through. So we don't see stocking. We just see it pass it. It's stable, Deane. You have some inflection up and down between the equipment side that the consumable portion is generally a steady eddy. It doesn't flex up or down. You have a little bit of price that goes through every year. I wouldn't be too concerned on quarter-to-quarter movements because they don't tend to be very high at the end of the day, and there's a lot of FX rolling through there just because of the fact that it is truly I think the only real true global business that we have. So it's steady, right? We don't see an inflection up in terms of production rates and consumer products. China seems to be, which was a headwind next year, seems to sequentially be improving. So we'll see from there, but it does run up against a strengthening dollar. Let me take the last question first, it's design in. I'm sure that our commercial teams will say it's not that easy. But the fact of the matter is it's designed in predominantly. Now there will be a variety of different negotiations with the participants that are building out the infrastructure, but the most important part, it's kind of win the spec business early on and then we see where we go from there. Data centers in Europe, I'm going to have to get back to you. I don't think it's meaningful. I think that the data center activity that we see is more North American-based."
